Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.

Julian Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I want to say thank you, Sean, for all the help. If we think about the margin progression, just to try and understand that a little bit more for the total company. So it's sort of flattish year-on-year in the first quarter, picks up steam over the balance of the year. Maybe help us understand how second half weighted that margin acceleration is? And are there any specific items on a segment level driving that, please?

Mike Stepniak
Senior VP & CFO

Sure, Julian. Thank you for the question. So we -- on the headline numbers, we're expanding 20 to 60. Operationally, we really are expanding margins about 50 to 90 basis points. And we have a little bit of a headwind of about 30 basis points this year from Quantinuum, that headwind is a little bit higher in the first quarter. In the first quarter, we also -- our taxes are the highest, and we're paying our interest expense for the year is the highest. So that's easing. So I think what you'll see from us 20 bps in the first quarter and then sequentially improving. Second half looks much better than the first half.

Vimal Kapur
Chairman & CEO

Yes. And Julian, what I'll add is that the fundamental playbook which Honeywell always executed on margin expansion, which is price, volume, productivity, that will be in full play this year. We do expect, as Mike mentioned, our operational margins to expand 50 to 90 basis points and invest some money back in Quantinuum. But we are very well programmed to deliver margin expansion as we did in the past, like 2023, we were 100 basis point margin expansion. So we are very confident in delivering our margin expansion rubric for 2026.

Mike Stepniak
Senior VP & CFO

And I would just also maybe add that last year, we talked about it, we stepped up on the engineering from an R&D standpoint. That's now normalized going into 2026. It's not a headwind for us. And last year, it was about, I think, 50 bps of headwind if you take 2025 as a whole.

Julian Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on the Aerospace margins specifically. I think they're starting out the year maybe down a touch year-on-year and then up a few tens of basis points for the year in aggregate. Maybe clarify kind of how you see those mix impacts playing out through the year. And there's been some discussion on commercial OE contract renewal timings and so forth. Is that a factor this year affecting the Aero margins at all?

Mike Stepniak
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. So maybe I'll just start with the 2025 progression, but I think it's important as you think about 2026. So we entered 2025, and we said we'll finish about 26% for the year. That's exactly what we did, and the team executed well despite the Liberation Day having to contend with the tariffs. Largely, tariffs are behind us. Going to 2026, price will be better for aerospace. Acquisition integration costs are abating.

That's also a tailwind and supply chain is continuing to improve. So for 2026, really, to me, it's a margin expansion question is really just a question of how much, and that's a factor of mix and how is mix going to play out in the business as well as how we continue to unlock and scale the supply chain and how the trajectory progresses. But 2026, I fully expect margin expansion in Aerospace.

Vimal Kapur
Chairman & CEO

And Julian, to your question on the OE contracts, we are indeed negotiating our contracts with multiple OEs as we speak, both on the commercial side and business jet side. Those are under progress right now. And what I can share you is that longer term, it will play bolt-on quite well for Aerospace margin expansion because nature of these is long term. So we remain very confident that it's going to have a positive impact on our margin expansion story for the business in the times ahead.

Sean Meakim
Vice President of Investor Relations

And Julian, one last piece I would just add on. Just thinking about the first quarter reminder that Liberation Day was in April. So there's a little bit of a lapping where we have that little bit of lag on the pricing impact relative to the tariffs in aerospace in the first quarter for the OE business.

Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.

Nigel Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

So a lot going on here, guys. Quantinuum, you announced you filed a confidential S-1 earlier this month. Are you fully committed to an IPO at this point? Or is there an option to bring in a strategic investor? And then I just want to make sure we get the right numbers on the investment spending. It looks like it's picking up by about $100 million year-over-year. So that would be, what, $250 million of total spend within corporate. Just want to make sure that's the number. And does the free cash flow or rather the cash burn kind of equate to that number as well?

Mike Stepniak
Senior VP & CFO

So I'll start and I'll let Vimal comment on the -- just on the commercial progress, et cetera. But you're exactly right. It's about $100 million year-over-year increase. We fully consolidate Quantinuum right now. As you know, our raise was quite successful. So Quantinuum has plenty of cash, but it flows through for Honeywell's financials. But it's about $100 million year-over-year increase in terms of maturation and commercial efforts that the team is progressing.

Vimal Kapur
Chairman & CEO

And Nigel, you put it well, a lot going on in Honeywell. So we are absolutely working on the Quantinuum lag. What I can share with you is we're obviously in the legal restrictions on what we can share. But as a practical matter, the progression on platform continues to be very promising, which is the reason we are investing more R&D dollars to continue to progress to launch the next version of our quantum machine, which is committed in 2027-time frame.

So that's the driver. And I actually spend a lot of time with the customers now to talk about leveraging Quantum for commercial applications. So think about banks, think about pharmaceutical companies and think about large governments, they're all very interested given we are coming closer to time to value.

And we are also building leadership team of Quantinuum business, expanding its capabilities so that it could stand alone as an independent company at the right time. So that's what I can share. I think a lot of wheels in motion, and we continue to work very hard to make it a successful business.

Nigel Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

That's very helpful. And then my follow-on is really just wanted to dig into the extraordinary strength in the process orders. Last time we checked in with you guys, you were talking about softness in large project activity. That seems to have changed 180. So just wondering what's changed and perhaps a bit more detail on where you're seeing the strength by geography or end market?

Vimal Kapur
Chairman & CEO

So Nigel, there are 2 dynamics going on in the market. On the positive side, people are spending capital to build more capacity in LNG and refining. That defined, that's showing our orders up so substantially and backlog up by 15%. So that's positive. Those are long cycle, and we, therefore, will show more revenue accretion from them in second half of 2026 because the cycle time is 12 to 18 months.

So we started lapping up our bookings from quarter 3 of last year and build the backlog, which will convert now Q3 and Q4 of 2026. On the -- also on the positive side, the LNG business continues to do quite well. Sundyne business we acquired is going to become baseline and organic growth. So that's going to help in the second half of the year. On the other side of the ledger, we continue to see pressure on the catalyst demand on petrochemical side. Petrochemical has excess capacity in the world.

So our customers are shying to buy more catalysts and also, I would say, in automation side, some of our migration offerings. So there's certainly a slowness there. our guide doesn't factor any change in that in 2026. Now I'm not suggesting it won't change, but we are cautious on how we are guiding at this point. And that remains the low point in the business. So strength in long cycle in LNG and refining and weakness in short cycle, specifically in the petrochemical side.

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.

Scott Davis
Melius Research LLC

Glad to see the final spin-off moving up here. But look, I wanted to talk a little bit about price because forever, Honeywell was kind of a 1% to 2% price company. And now the last couple of years, you've been able to capture meaningfully more, 4% now, which is still meaningfully more than the peer group average. But what -- can you guys walk through -- there's kind of 2 angles here.

I mean, one is kind of passing through tariff impacts, and that's not a structural price increase that's more of a pass-through. But can you talk about really how much of this price is kind of a change in pricing strategy, how you guys' approach projects, contracts, obviously, new products help, I would imagine. And how much of that 4% is kind of just the run-of-the-mill passing on tariffs?

Vimal Kapur
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Scott, it's a great question, and I think a lot about it on the dynamic. I think fundamentally, the inflation drivers have become more persistent in the markets we serve. And I drive the insistent -- the inflation drivers into 3 buckets. Labor cost is increasing typically 3% to 4% in a typical year. There are labor shortages. There's enough talk -- messaging around that. We also see cost increase in electronics prices. Memory is a new driver now.

Of course, it's a small portion of what we buy, but it all starts compounding. And then commodity prices keep going up. I mean there's a lot of news on gold, but then there's also other commodities, which keep ramping up. So when you put it all together, fundamentally, the inflationary trend in industrial segment and segments specifically Honeywell serve, they remain quite persistent.

And our pricing strategy, therefore, has become more mature really to look at it as a long-term trend, work with our customers and align with them that what's coming ahead and minimize the impact on their businesses to the extent we can and deploy pricing, which is also different by regions.

It could be one in U.S., different in Europe, different in other parts of the world, also different for new products because we need to see where we have some leverage there based upon feature function, which are differentiated. So a lot going on, on the pricing front. And I would say 2026 is going to look very similar to 2025 in the same ZIP code. And we spend a lot of time to make sure that the price cost doesn't become a headwind for us, and we do maximum to preserve our volume while we are preserving our margins.

Mike Stepniak
Senior VP & CFO

I would just maybe just add that to -- if you look at our portfolio, we've been migrating to high-growth verticals where we can afford better pricing, and we have a bigger step-up in terms of revenue that is generated by NPI, and these products tend to be accretive and give us better pricing as well.

Scott Davis
Melius Research LLC

Yes. No. And then just the natural follow-up would just be, is there -- when you talk about NPI and you talked about product launches, but is there -- do you guys use a vitality index or anything internally? And any kind of way to kind of compare the acceleration of NPI versus the past?

Vimal Kapur
Chairman & CEO

Yes, you saw one of the mentions of that in our growth acceleration chart in our prepared remarks. One thing we certainly started measuring is how much of revenue in a given year is coming from new products, net new growth coming from new products. And last year, it was approximately 4%. It means our R&D dollars are creating a differentiated demand into our offerings, and we are able to either keep share or gain share or able to move to new verticals. So we are measuring 2 key KPIs. One is vitality.

We used to measure that Scott for many years. And what I learned is some of our segments high vitality is just right to play because the turnaround of the products is so fast. And if your vitality is not 40s and 50s, you basically may start losing share. So incrementally, while we continue to measure vitality and RemainCo Honeywell will have vitality in high 40s, think about 45% or so. We also now measure every quarter new product -- revenue coming from new products.

And our internal target is like we did 4% last year, like to maintain that rate. That requires a lot of ideation, working with the customers, having the right ideas and so on. But that's going to be the new playbook for Honeywell that we want to grow through new products and then whatever market allows us to pick up on price. So yes, that's how I will summarize that comment.

Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.

C. Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just to clarify that answer, so you're expecting roughly 3% price this year.

Mike Stepniak
Senior VP & CFO

Price will be above 3%. I would say most likely 3.5%. Depending on geography and the vertical, we're deploying 3% to 4%, on average should be 3.5%. And quarterly also, there will be a little bit of movement, but that's kind of the framework we're using for the year with the teams.

C. Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So at the low end of the range, you have volume down 50 bps?

Mike Stepniak
Senior VP & CFO

No, no. It really just depends on the -- we deploy price at SKU level essentially. So it's depending on how fast -- if the product is growing at 1% and market doesn't allow us to deploy more price, we won't do that.

Vimal Kapur
Chairman & CEO

I think low end, I would say, Steve, is volume growth in the low end of the guide, 3% to 6% is 0. High end, it is about 3%. So that's kind of how you want to look at the guide, 3% to 6% price being somewhere around 3% to 3.5% and the balance is volume.

C. Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. It seems pretty conservative with your order growth rate, but I won't belabor on that point. Just on the stranded costs, it seems like -- I would have maybe expected the Advanced Materials stranded costs to come out a little bit quicker. Can you maybe just level set us on where those stranded costs lie today, especially on the Aero side, what to expect and how those should layer out of the numbers because that seems to be a relatively heavy burden that you're leaving in there, but should be a tailwind at some point in the next 18 months or so?

Vimal Kapur
Chairman & CEO

No, you're right, Steve. So we have already neutralized the Advanced Materials stranded costs in 2026. So that's one of the walks we have shown in our margin expansion that it is net neutral. So the headwind of that is gone, which shows that we are looking ahead and executing it as simultaneously as we're working through the spin.

Now specifically coming to the aerospace question, right now, I will admit that we are so heavily focused to make spin happen in Q3, we'll share the specifics of stranded costs, et cetera, during our Investor Day coming up in June. But we are absolutely confident and committed that we will eliminate stranded costs in 12 to 18 months' time. Earlier, the better, we absolutely get it. But that's the range we expect to take it out.

C. Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then just one last one on Aero. Can you give us any kind of magnitude of margin improvement embedded in the guidance for Aero this year? Is it 25, 50 bps? Like maybe just a little bit of color on directionally magnitude.

Sean Meakim
Vice President of Investor Relations

Yes, I would say modest, Steve. I think like low 30s incrementals.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.

Deane Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Congrats to the team on hitting these transformation milestones earlier. And also best to Sean, and welcome back to Mark. Just the -- first question, just you've been now more specific about the portfolio cleanups for PSS and warehouse. What can you tell us about the sales process?

Vimal Kapur
Chairman & CEO

So I would say at this point, we have a lot of interest on both the businesses. And we expect to do a sign of the deals in quarter 2. On the specific within the quarter, it's hard to pinpoint a month here at this point, but we do expect that quarter 2, we'll be able to sign it and the close will be customary regulatory approvals. So that you can then estimate that the total time this business may not be part of Honeywell.

What it does is, Deane, interestingly, when we complete the transaction of Warehouse Automation business Intelligrated and Productivity Solutions business, it simplifies us into 3 end markets. Process, buildings, and industrial because this allows us to make a choice not to be in the transportation, logistics and warehouse markets. Not that these are bad markets, it's more a question of where we want to participate as a company. So it's a choice to be made.

And the second thing it does is it makes Industrial Automation as a sensing and measurement business. We had one of the challenges of Industrial Automation being a complex business to understand with a lot of segments and a lot of drivers. So with this decision, we are able to narrow down the business to sensing and measurement, which gives us a platform on which we will build upon through organic growth. And hopefully, we look at more inorganic actions in the future. So it plays out extremely well in our overarching strategy.

Deane Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

That's real helpful. And the second question, there was a reference about pockets of weakness in Europe and China. Maybe just give us a sense of from the geographies, what you're seeing at the margin.

Vimal Kapur
Chairman & CEO

I would say that those comments are specifically for Industrial Automation business. Industrial Automation business is seeing strength in North America and U.S. in particular. The segments are performing extremely well. But the segments of IA business in China and in Europe, the exposures we have in end markets we serve, we see pressure there, and that's the weakness in short cycle in Europe. Now that's not true for other parts of Honeywell.

If you see building automation, they don't see pressure in Europe and China because they serve different markets and they have different product lines. So it's very specific to Industrial Automation at this point, and we'll observe how the year progresses. What we are doing is we are focused on launching much more new products so that we are able to generate more demand organically to offset some of these drivers, and we'll observe how the year progresses with our actions to counter some of these market conditions.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.

Sheila Kahyaoglu
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I'll focus on aerospace, if that's okay. All 3 end markets grew double digits in '25. Maybe if you could tell us the rank order of how you're thinking about 2026 end markets and any changes around the medium-term growth trajectories as we prep for Investor Day in June.

Sean Meakim
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thanks, Sheila. Yes, I would say that we were really pleased with the progress the team made on supply chain, really great performance on volume, especially to end the year. So great momentum, particularly with the order rates going into '26. Looking at the growth rates by end market, we'd say Defense and Space is likely to lead. So high single digits, maybe creeping in a low double depending on supply chain progress.

We then expect OE to be high single-digit growth and then still strong performance in aftermarket but continue on that path towards normalization. So call it, mid- to high single-digit growth is the range. And all that should blend to a high single-digit performance for 2026.

Sheila Kahyaoglu
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then one on -- I know a lot has been asked on margins already, but just specifically around incremental investments as we see it from the defense contractors. How are you thinking about incremental investments surrounding your portfolio within aerospace and R&D focus areas?

Vimal Kapur
Chairman & CEO

Sheila, we have been investing. If you look at the broader theme of investment, we have been investing in supply chain. We have telegraphed that earlier, more than $1 billion investment. And then we have delivered volume growth over 14 quarters now, double-digit volume growth, which results into our organic growth. Now in 2025, 2026, overall Honeywell CapEx increase is about $250 million.

Aero is a large part of it. And its good news in my view because Aero needs more volumes. It needs to expand supply chain capacity. There are other parts of investment and other parts of automation business, but Aero has a large share of it. So fundamentally speaking, we are able to deliver to Department of War needs for more volume.

And in fact, we are close to PO now hardly with any past due, which shows that we have ability to meet their needs of the volume they are looking for. So we are very well positioned there. I think our volume capacity, our investments are always in order, and we'll continue to make more if it is necessary to grow the business.

Mike Stepniak
Senior VP & CFO

Sheila, it's about $150 million in CapEx increase next year. Majority of it is going to be funded through working capital improvement. So no impact...

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with UBS.

Amit Mehrotra
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Vimal, the Building Automation growth has been good the last few quarters. And I think some of that is applicable to kind of the success you've had in plugging the assets into Forge. And I guess the question I have is, what is the -- how can you -- can you replicate that in the process and industrial businesses, whereby maybe that -- those cyclical parts of the business, you can generate more recurring revenue by upselling some of the services by plugging into your platform. Can you just talk about that? Or are those just 2 different things?

Vimal Kapur
Chairman & CEO

Yes. No, the -- excellent question, Amit. We have been working very hard to change our business model to more recurring revenue. And the basis of that is stronger linkage to our IoT platform, Forge. Building started that first and process started that later. I would say the gap between that is about 9 to 12 months. And we can clearly see results in the buildings. What we have been able to do is really build -- I'm going to use the word ontology-based models.

It means that we are able to -- when we connect the building, we are able to identify all its assets and really build a reference data model for our customer, which allows us to then build different applications on top of it. And hopefully, when we are in Investor Day, we'll be able to show you agents on top of Forge, which are managing different operations, maintenance, energy management. So we have moved now to agentic way of working on our customer base. And you're absolutely right.

That kind of innovation is driving the growth of pull-through of our products because it's a one solution, it's not separated from other. Now we're on the same journey in the process. We are just about 9 months, 12 months behind. Connected plant is our key offering, which takes our customer installed base, both on process technology and process automation and again, ability to build this ontology-based model and then give a much more stronger capability to optimize their operations.

So that's coming. That's coming soon. And we do expect that to become an enabler for recurring revenue growth in the process segment in the near future. And then finally, in the industrial side, our business is far more becoming sensing and measurement. It's less about controls, but we have to evolve that strategy there. But I remain very confident we are going to see the same pattern in process in the very near future.

Amit Mehrotra
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And just sort of very much related to that, your Building Automation revenue forecast is kind of mid-single-digit plus this year. It feels like that journey and connecting those 11,000 to 12,000 assets in the field is kind of 1/3 of the way through. And I think you guys have a goal of kind of accelerating that this year. So I'm just wondering, is it just conservatism? Because it seems like as you get to that journey of fully connected asset, you can actually drive sustainability in that kind of high single-digit organic growth.

Vimal Kapur
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean our penetration, Amit, actually is much lower, which gives us a lot of runway and upside. We'll share those details during Investor Day, how much of installed base is penetrated from connected assets perspective. But also bear in mind that recurring revenue takes time to scale. So if I -- as our recurring revenue bank is building, it just compounds every year at a bigger scale. So we are at a low base at this point.

But we do believe that we also will continue to ramp it up at a much higher rate in the times ahead as our ARR is growing there. And we expect to share 2 things during the Investor Day. Our offerings on Forge, both for buildings and process and industrial, some initial ideas and then our ARR strategy, how much it is and how much we expect it to compound in the times ahead.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.

Nicole DeBlase
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Just wanted to start on some of the order trends that you saw during the quarter. Can we talk Vimal about how short-cycle order trends generally trended and not just relative to 3Q, but also throughout the cadence of each month of the quarter?

Mike Stepniak
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. So I would tell you that generally, you have to look at it regionally. So U.S., Meta, India, short-cycle orders performed well throughout the year and in the fourth quarter as well. On the other hand, Europe and China, at least for where we participate, specifically in Industrial Automation, we were just okay, not great.

Going into the first quarter, we see that orders generally will be high single digits on the short cycle side, probably mid-single digits for BA and aerospace. And then on IA and PA&T, we will continue to monitor. But as Vimal mentioned earlier, the catalyst and conversions are a little bit slow.

Nicole DeBlase
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just a question on Industrial Automation margins. I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that this is where you guys expect the greatest year-on-year margin expansion in 2026. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit on that with respect to the magnitude of potential margin expansion?

Mike Stepniak
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So vis-a-vis our guide of 20% to 60% and what are we driving operationally, we have Industrial Automation at close to 100 bps. And the reason for it, if you look at the margin trajectory and progression, we feel like Industrial Automation has the most opportunity, both from a productivity operationally as well as pricing and leverage volume and demand. And so that's how we instrumented the year, and I have a high confidence, and the team will execute on that.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with Morgan Stanley.

Christopher Snyder
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I wanted to follow up on some of the commercial OE contracting discussion. Just given the very long nature of these contracts, I imagine these negotiations are a lot more comprehensive than just pricing for some of the tariff pressure that's come through over the last year. So I don't know maybe you don't want to kind of frame the magnitude of these conversations, but any color there would be helpful. Or if you could just maybe talk about like when was the last time the company did a big comprehensive commercial OE price reset?

Vimal Kapur
Chairman & CEO

So Chris, these contract negotiations don't span one particular OE, first of all. I mean this is more than one. Few are large, few are small. That's just a matter of fact. And some of these are due for a long time, think about 5 years plus in some cases. So the impact of that, you're absolutely right because when you're renegotiating a contract after 5, 7, 8 years, not only you're looking at the pricing changes, but other aspects of the contract.

And that's why it takes a very long time to renegotiate our long-term contracts here. And as I said before, these renegotiated contracts will be very well for Aerospace margin expansion in the future. So it will be a great setup because we lap all the previous long-term inflation, we have been absorbing in some of these contracts, that won't be a headwind anymore.

Christopher Snyder
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Really appreciate that. Yes, certainly a lot of cost inflation over the last 5, 7, 8 years. Maybe just a quick one. I think you guys mentioned that R&D was kind of at the full run rate, obviously, increased in '25. So is that right? Is R&D kind of at a full run rate level now? And I know Aero takes a long time to convert into sales. But I would imagine the industrial side of the business converts quicker. So can you just maybe talk about how you think some of the R&D spend converts to sales on industrial? And could there be any tailwinds from that over the next 12 months?

Mike Stepniak
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So like I said earlier, I think the R&D right now is at the level that we wanted it. It's about 4.8% of sales. That we feel is a sweet spot for us. quarterly going from -- into the first quarter, that will continue to abate and will be more normalized. And we're obviously getting revenue growth, which will be a tailwind from a margin standpoint.

Vimal Kapur
Chairman & CEO

And the cycle time, Chris, varies from, I would say, 18 months, 15 to 18 months for the short cycle and for the long-cycle business like aerospace and some of our process technology could be 3 to 5 years. So these are long bets in some cases, and it's our job as leadership to put those bets so that we could not deliver even short-term growth but also position the company well for the long-term growth.

Mike Stepniak
Senior VP & CFO

And -- if you look at our corporate costs, I mean, it's really for us, the 30 bps drag on Quantinuum, no impact from R&D, stranded costs we addressed in the -- throughout last year. So we don't have a lot of stranded costs as far as Solstice. So we feel really good about the progression we're making on our structural cost.

Operator

Our final question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.

Andrew Obin
BofA Securities, Research Division

On the question on building automation, just a follow-up. Can we just talk about how much growth is coming from Access Solution cross-sell? And also how much exposure do you have there to data centers just because you are the market leader on building automation, I would imagine that's a nice tailwind as well.

Vimal Kapur
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So Andrew, the Access Solutions acquisition is playing extremely well. And overall, the revenue in that segment is growing high single digit, in line with Building Automation, which is growing high single digits. So our thesis has played out quite well. The second part of your question that sales synergies have been a big feature of it, that was one of the main drivers we thought this business will create a lot of value, and that's been additive to the overall growth.

And again, it's reflected in Building Automation numbers because that growth is not only coming in Access Solutions business, we are able to pull through a lot of access solution in our projects business in our solutions side of the house there. So that certainly is becoming an important play. And finally, data center overall position of Honeywell in building automation is becoming slowly material. We are inching towards that becoming greater than 5% of our revenue. Think about it, that number was 0 a couple of years back. So we are inching our way through across all the 3 solutions we provide in data center, the safety for fire, the environmental controls to building measurement system and security. So we continue to work our way through. And as that market is performing, that will continue to help the growth of building automation.

Andrew Obin
BofA Securities, Research Division

And another question, a follow-up question. After selling productivity solutions and warehouse and workflow solutions, do you anticipate further portfolio actions on Industrial Automation side or beyond that?

Vimal Kapur
Chairman & CEO

No. I mean we are very pleased with the end state. And as I mentioned, Andrew, that we have built now a business in Industrial Automation, which is heavily focused on sensing and measurement. So we have a common block sensing in sensors for aerospace, sensor for medical devices, measurement system for gas detection in industrial, in semiconductor, measurement of gas and others. So we have a common theme, which allows us to build a business around it. So we'll scale from here. So stay tuned as we share our strategy for Industrial Automation during our Investor Day.
