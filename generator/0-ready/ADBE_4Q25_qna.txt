[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.

Mark Murphy
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congratulations on a great finish to the year. Shantanu, down at Adobe MAX, the energy, the enthusiasm was just truly phenomenal, and it felt to us like a breakthrough moment. Talking to customers down there, there was just quite a bit of interest in Firefly Foundry specifically because customers can end up with this private AI model and something that will understand their identity and their style. Can you speak to how customers are starting to use Foundry in the early stages and perhaps just what type of economic potential that might be able to unleash for Adobe?

Shantanu Narayen
Chairman & CEO

Sure, Mark, and thanks for the comment. I'll start and then maybe David can add as well. And I did see in your report that you had sort of the work that you've been doing behind the scenes to understand customer sentiment. So we appreciate that. From our perspective, we just look at it and for enterprises, the entire content supply chain, GenStudio is really the offering that we want to provide that takes care of every aspect of their content production, whether it's the creation part of the campaign, whether it's then creating custom models, whether it's training it at the back end, whether it's automating it and then certainly delivery. And so Firefly Services is off to a great start, continues, I think, in the prepared remarks, David talked about the hundreds of deals that we're signing in that particular space.

And Foundry just takes it to a different level in terms of our ability to customize, whether it's for a retailer, whether it's for media and entertainment, the ability to do a lot more. So we really view that as a massive opportunity in terms of whether it's a marketing team or the entire media and entertainment workflow that allows them to create content, deliver that content, localize it. But maybe, David, you can add to some of the sort of customers and what we can do there as well.

David Wadhwani
President of Digital Media Business

Yes. As Shantanu talked about, because we have this great position with GenStudio and the content supply chain, we've been hearing more and more from customers that in order to take it to the next level, they need more than what off-the-shelf models can provide. And as a result, we introduced Foundry, like you mentioned, at MAX. And the core value is that we train on their content, their data and their brand guidelines. We're able to generate images, videos, audio and 3D models and we operate it as a managed service. So marketing teams can then train on product shots, environment styles, brand guidelines and media companies actually train on their individual franchises, whether it's a movie or whether it's a series, they'll train their characters, their sets, their props, their locations so they can generate the whole thing.

I'll give you one example from a financials or economics perspective. Let's take a media and entertainment company we're working on, and I'm rounding the numbers here, but to give you a little bit of context, let's say, that organization was spending $10 million with us ARR on our core creative products that we've been selling with them. We ran a sales process with them, engagement with them for about 6 months. We were able to sell them Firefly Services and Firefly Foundry for about $7 million, so a pretty significant step up in terms of the engagement that we have with the customer.

We were able to train models within 2 or 3 months, and now we're running some of those models specifically as managed services for them for ideation and production processes. They're already seeing increased efficiency in content production. They're able to generate more production content, and they're now getting into opportunities that are revenue-bearing opportunities like increasing the types of content they produce for social shorts and personalizing more of it for fan engagement with integration with our real-time CDP. And of course, that's with just a few of their franchises, more opportunities to expand beyond that. So very excited.

Shantanu Narayen
Chairman & CEO

And maybe one last thing to just punctuate what David said. So the vision clearly is that for every single brand, if you're a consumer company or for every single TV show or a movie, we can create a Foundry specifically for that particular franchise, as David said, because the ability to help with the automation of that content and production is massive.

And the next question will come from Matt Swanson with RBC Capital Markets.

Matthew Swanson
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Great. I had a question kind of as we expand the product portfolio and the go-to-market motion of really marrying up the Creative Cloud and the Experience Cloud. Could you just talk about maybe the ROI focus on kind of justifying the value creation of these new productivity enhancements, right? We've seen through all your product demos how much more content can be created, but really being able to marry that up to results and really kind of why is it a good thing for the enterprise that they have all these new capabilities?

Shantanu Narayen
Chairman & CEO

Well, if you take a step back, Matt, and you think about every single business, I mean there are trillions of dollars that are spent in marketing and our opportunity is to really say we can help you make sure that, that content is more personalized. I'll have Anil also add after this and deliver it. And the fact is that since we can deliver that content through an ad network and then we understand through our analytics where that is resulting in traffic, where that is resulting in conversion, where that's not, we're the only company that can close the loop from the creation of a campaign, the execution of that campaign as well as then actually looking at what that causes in terms of commerce.

And so I think our real value proposition in all of this is that as increasingly people are saying, "Hey, I want to use AI to create more." We can not only optimize and accelerate the amount of content that they're producing, but we're the only company that can then help them say, "Hey, this caused so much traffic." And I think we can speak more to that as well as it relates to what we are doing around search, LLM and ROI.

Anil Chakravarthy
President of Digital Experience Business

Exactly, as you said, Shantanu, depending on the industry, 10% to 20% of the total marketing budget is actually spent on content, on content creation and production. And exactly with the content supply chain, the solution we offer to GenStudio, one, we are helping them reduce the content production, creation and production cost. But equally importantly, we're helping them create the content much -- in a much more agile manner and create a lot more content. So most marketers are moving from traditional marketing channels to a lot of the new channels, like Shantanu was saying, digital channels, both for paid media as well as their own media. And that requires a lot more agility in content production. Therefore, the content supply chain solution that we offer helps them get a lot more effectiveness out of their marketing and better ROI.

And we'll take our next question from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.

Ivan Radojicic
Wolfe Research, LLC

This is Ivan here on the line for Alex. Maybe one question on -- going back to Semrush acquisition, can you maybe talk a little bit about what was the strategic rationale, a little more color on that and maybe how we should think about the synergies from the deal for next year?

Anil Chakravarthy
President of Digital Experience Business

Yes. If you look at what's top of mind for marketers right now, when we think of customer experience orchestration, brand visibility is one of the key areas that's top of mind for marketers, how their brands appear, how they're positioned, especially in new channels like the LLMs, whether it's ChatGPT or Google or Perplexity, that's top of mind for marketers.

So one of the things that we do really well by bringing Adobe and Semrush together, we will be able to offer a comprehensive solution for marketers so that whether it is their own media like their own websites and their mobile apps, whether it is earned media like these LLMs or across search engines, they have one solution that helps them improve their brand visibility and make sure that they understand what customers are searching for, what prospects are actually searching for or prompting for, and they are in the right places in the right way with their brands. And we are the only ones that can offer a comprehensive solution to be able to do that across their own channels as well as all of these new channels like LLMs in addition to search engines.

Shantanu Narayen
Chairman & CEO

Maybe the one thing I'll say is also based on the previous question that Matt had, when we think about our own spend and how we do this at Adobe as we are engaging with billions of customers, being able to provide an integrated way of spending money across search, across LLMs and understanding what is the relative efficiency of that. I think most companies would say when they're seeing their business move up and to the right, it's now coming from a more diverse set of channels. And this just allows us between the search engine and the generative engine to provide this unified approach. So I think it's very unique and then we can provide the analytics for folks. So I think combining both your questions, this is why the excitement around the creative and marketing and the combination of that is something that really gives us a lot of confidence.

And moving on to our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.

Keith Weiss
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Excellent. Congratulations on a solid end of the year. Maybe a kind of longer-term focus question. You guys have been clear that the strategy is proliferation first and then kind of monetization going forward when it comes to a lot of these technologies and a lot of the innovation that you're pushing into the base. And I think some of the metrics that we're seeing in Q4 are getting us a little bit excited that we're starting to see some of that ability.

You guys talked about monthly active users up over 15%. So the user base is growing. You talked about 3x growth in the usage of the models on a quarter-on-quarter basis, so that usage is ramping up. When can we potentially see this sort of grow the totality or stabilize or accelerate the totality of growth at Adobe? Meaning another -- when can we see a year where ARR growth is stable, right, on a year-on-year basis are actually improving? Because I think that's what investors really want to see to get more confident in the stock and start revisiting the stock and coming back to the shares.

Shantanu Narayen
Chairman & CEO

Yes, Keith, I mean, from my perspective, Q4 was a really strong quarter and frankly starting to be this inflection in terms of as we see the leading indicators, what is happening across the leading indicators, which gives us a lot of confidence. And that's why when you look at the Total Adobe ARR growth target, which translates to approximately $2.6 billion, that's the highest beginning of the year guide for total net new ARR.

But unpacking your question, you're absolutely right. I mean when we think about how we've innovated in AI and transformed the business to serve the massive customer audiences that we see, what we've done a really good job of is in the business pros and consumers, you're seeing the MAU increase. You've seen the fact that we've got this technology in front of a lot of people, we've got usage. You saw the metrics that I think David provided there in terms of what's happening on the freemium usage of that. So that's the early indicator.

On the Creative Pro, what we have seen across all 3 parts of the business, which is what's happening in Creative Cloud, what's happening in Firefly as a new app, and to the earlier question, Firefly Foundry, the automation associated with that. So we look at all of the 3 markets that we serve. And I think in the data as well, I'm sure you looked at the fact that when you look at what's happening on the creative business, you can see given you have underlying visibility into the core creative subscription that is now growing sequentially quarter-over-quarter, and that's coming. Frankly, the record Digital Media ARR is coming as a result of all 3 of them.

So I think we're pleased not just with the strong Q4, but underlying how we've actually changed the sort of underlying part of the business to be whether it's on MAU, whether it's infusing AI, whether it's on higher-value products and combining all of that, frankly, for the enterprise, which we continue to think is a differentiated strategy for us. So we have to just keep executing. But I think Q4 was an inflection in the early indicators which we continue to track.

And our next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein.

Shelly Tang
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

This is Shelly calling on behalf of Mark. Congratulations on solid quarter. Total Adobe NA ARR growth this year ended at 11.5%. And next year, you're guiding to 10.2%. Could you help us understand what is driving the difference between this year's growth and the guidance? Is it certain parts of the market that you think might behave differently next year versus this year?

Shantanu Narayen
Chairman & CEO

Well, first, I guess there's another call that's also going on. So -- but from our perspective, when we look at it, I think you have to look at it also in terms of the absolute and the target actually shows momentum across all of these audiences. And so if you think that we've been -- we accomplished approximately $2.6 billion, this actually starts our guide for fiscal '26 at that level. So I think from our perspective, it's showing the momentum that we have. And to your second question, as we think about the ARR across the business professionals and consumers as well as the creative and marketing professionals, this is predicated on our confidence associated with all 3 customer groups, as opposed to one of them.

Again, to the question that Keith asked earlier, it reflects the progress that we made on Express and Acrobat, whether it's with AI Assistant, whether it's with PDF Spaces, whether it's with infusing creativity into that offering, Firefly and Creative Cloud and Creative Pro, CC Pro offering, Firefly Services, so across the board and AEP and apps, Anil talked about AEP and apps. He talked about GenStudio brand visibility as well as the acquisition of Semrush that will -- when that happens, based on all the regulatory conditions that we need to fulfill, that also adds to our offering. So we're pleased with our performance in Q4, and we're excited about the future.

And we'll take a question from Jake Roberge with William Blair.

Jacob Roberge
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Good to see the partnership announcement and integration with ChatGPT. David, as you expand to these new surfaces outside of the Adobe ecosystem, how are you thinking about driving monetization of that usage or converting those users over to your platform?

David Wadhwani
President of Digital Media Business

Yes. Our focus has always been around sort of meeting customers where they are. And that used to predominantly be focused on search and the web, and now we're seeing this incredible growth with LLMs. And so we are taking all of our technology and making sure that it can run in these LLMs. They represent, in our mind, a great top of funnel. They let us reach new users that we typically wouldn't have reached with some of the traditional markets that we go through, and we can engage them in new ways. And it gives us the journey work that's already in there, gives us the opportunity to flow them into our full paid plan. So it's a real top-of-funnel game with a conversion opportunity on the back end of that.

And one of the -- maybe the more important elements and moments of why this is such a critical moment for us is that as LLMs start embracing these model context protocols, these MCP endpoints, it's no longer that these LLMs are about a prompt to a model and a response. It now gives us the opportunity to have the LLMs actually work with models and APIs, and that plays to a really strong strength that we have and durable differentiator given the incredible APIs we have across creativity and productivity. So it lets us reach a lot more customers, it lets us atomize the capabilities, double down on the freemium experience that we've been putting in place. As Keith mentioned, our creative freemium MAU grew over 35% and this just continues to drive that. And we're starting to see the tail end of that turn into conversion and show up in our results.

And our next question will come from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo.

Michael Turrin
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

You mentioned credit consumption up 3x this quarter. I was just hoping to hear a bit more around what you're seeing from an overall consumption perspective, how third-party models are impacting that and if you're becoming at all more confident in monetizing or forecasting consumption. And then secondarily, from your perspective, are there better or worse scenarios for us to be thinking about in terms of which of the larger models win mind share in the market for Adobe just given I think you've seen a lot of differing opinions of that, especially of late.

David Wadhwani
President of Digital Media Business

Yes, happy to take that. So just for the broader group on the call, if you take a step back, we introduced generative credits a few years ago when we introduced generative AI into our products and customers get credits in a couple different ways. First, all of our plans now come with some base level of credit access. And of course, higher-end plans include more credits.

The second thing is that when customers deplete their credits, they can get more credits in 1 of 2 ways. They can upgrade to a higher-end plan and/or they can purchase generative credit add-on packs. And as we think about the growth algorithm associated with this, it's really a multiplier across 4 different things. First of all, the number of apps that have these generative capabilities times the number of media types that we support, times the number of use cases and workflows that we've integrated these into times the number of models that we have that people are able to use. And we had major updates for all of these at MAX earlier this -- earlier in Q4.

From an apps perspective, we now have these generative capabilities into our Firefly app, our Creative Cloud applications, including Photoshop, Premiere, Lightroom, obviously, also in the Creative Cloud Pro offer that we have. From a media types perspective, we've been doing a lot with images, video, audio design. We've seen a huge inflection in terms of video consumption in particular. So that's been a great sort of contributor to the growth we're seeing.

In terms of use cases, we've been focused on editing use cases, we've been expanding those editing use cases, but we also introduced Firefly Boards which is around ideation that generates hundreds of images or videos or designs and also bulk generation at the end of the process for individuals that want to do bulk actions on things. And then last, it's the models continue to get better. With Firefly and our partner models, we're seeing higher resolution outputs. We're seeing higher density and quality. All of those things also increase the number of credits that are getting consumed. And so in addition to all that, we announced a big amplifier to onboarding, which was we have a very attractively priced plan with our Firefly apps. It's really an all-in-one offer. You can get the world's best models from Adobe and third parties, and they're fully integrated into these amazing workflows at a very attractive onboarding price.

So all of that led to the 3x quarter-over-quarter growth in generation. And as a result of that, as we touched on, we're starting to see increasing user upgrades to higher price plans and including credit pack add-ons. So we're excited and you saw that in some of the numbers. And our vision here is we'll work with all the great model providers, of course, including the work we're doing internally. And we will increasingly be the single destination that everyone comes to access those models.

Operator

And that question comes from Keith Bachman with BMO.

Keith Bachman
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Yes. David, I'd like to direct this to you, if I could, and just ask you how you thinking about the components or the construct of growth over the course of FY '26. And if I break it into 2 parts, just wondering if you could comment specifically on seats within the creator and marketing professionals, not looking for specific numbers, but is seat growth remain steady within that category. It looks like you're filling the top of the funnel across the board. But really, what I'm asking about is paid seat growth. Would you anticipate that, that remains steady in FY '26?

And then the second part of the question is, in the prepared remarks, Digital Media more broadly it was 75% was upselling price and then the balance was basically price. And what I'm asking the spirit of the question is, despite growing competition, do you think pricing is still a lever that you can draw on to support growth in '26 and beyond?

David Wadhwani
President of Digital Media Business

Yes. Happy to take that. A few things. One is, I know we've spent a number of time -- a number of -- a couple years with all of you explaining the evolution of the product lineup. A few years ago, we used to have -- in the creative ecosystem, we used to have Creative Cloud All Apps and Creative Cloud Single Apps. And one of the most important things we've done over that period of time is to really look at where and how consumers or business professionals want to engage with creativity. And we found that it's very different.

So when it comes to our lineup, we now have an increasing number of freemium offers with business professionals, with the introduction of Express, but also the introduction of Acrobat Studio, which has -- is off to a great start. We have a specific offer for creators with everything we're doing with the Firefly application. And again, that's another freemium offer, but also has nice sort of tiered pricing associated with it.

We have strong momentum with Creative Pros and those using the Creative Cloud applications. We've mentioned in the past, and we continue to see very strong migration over to the Creative Cloud Pro plan, the higher-value plan that has more generative capabilities embedded in it. And we have -- at the very tail end of that process, we have the ability to do all of this automation work that we have associated with Firefly Services and Firefly Foundry integrated into GenStudio.

So as we look at creativity and how it's seeped into all these different flows, we feel really good in the first 2, as we said, with the freemium MAU increasing over 35% year-over-year and our ability to start converting some of that MAU with the plans that we have in place now with both Express and Acrobat Studio, and with everything we're doing with Firefly. And we're continuing to see strong usage, that 3x growth we talked about, you see a lot of creative professionals actually using that and starting to see more and more and more reliance and value from that in addition to what we're seeing in the enterprise.

So overall, we're seeing strong seat growth. We continue to believe that we have a lot of user acquisition ahead of us. We continue to see a lot of value to pricing opportunity with creative professionals, and I think there's a lot more ahead of us on that. And as we mentioned in that case with media -- the media company and enterprises at the highest end, we think that automation is going to be a really good addition and sort of additional rocket engine to what we do.

Shantanu Narayen
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, David, and thank you all for joining us. Since that was the last question, what I wanted to again just summarize was not only was Q4 a good strong end to the year, I would say fiscal '25, we just continue to execute. And in particular, I'm pleased with 3 aspects of what we are focused on. The first is certainly our customer groupings as we provide these tailored offerings for business professionals and consumers and creative and marketing professionals, how we've embraced AI and infused AI into all of those offerings, demonstrating that, that's the value that people look as they increasingly adopt our solutions, and something that we probably talked a little less about but the execution that we have across all routes to market.

And so whether that's what we are doing on digital online in terms of engaging with our customers, what's happening both through the channel as well as our phone in terms of selling to small and medium businesses and certainly, at the higher end, the strategic partnerships and the relationships that we're creating at the enterprise across our combined offerings. So thank you for joining us. Happy holidays and we look forward to continuing to execute against our strategy and sharing more with you in the future. Thank you.

Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have an excellent day.
