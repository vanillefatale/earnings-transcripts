[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.

Larry Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So Robert, on the last call, you seemed comfortable with consensus revenue growth, but you're guiding a little bit lower today. I assume that's related to Nutrition. Can you talk about what's changed since the last call and how you're thinking about the year playing out from a cadence standpoint? I assume you would expect growth to accelerate through the year given your comments on Nutrition and some of the launches. And I'll leave it at that.

Robert Ford
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Larry. I think if I remember, you're the one who asked that question back in October. And when I answered that question, I think consensus was 7.5% top line. EPS was 10%. So today, we guided the midpoint at 7% on top line, 10% on the bottom. So midpoint here is 0.5% lower than what was consensus. But other than that, nothing has really changed. The EPS is in line with consensus, expecting healthy margin expansions. I'm sure we're going to talk a lot about the pipeline, which is either on target or ahead of schedule in certain products. Balance sheet is in great shape. We feel good about us closing Exact. So the 0.5 point change on the top line is, as you pointed out, is really the change in the near-term outlook, I'd say, of our Nutrition business.

You saw in our quarter, in our Q4, we had a negative quarter. And as I said in my comments, there's a component of this business -- it's a health care-driven product portfolio, but there's a component of it, a dynamic of it that is very much aligned with consumer packaged goods. And I'd say the challenges that CPG businesses have been facing are pretty well known following pandemic, pretty significant surge in costs between 2022 and 2024 to offset that. I think we all went ahead and try to mitigate it with price increases that obviously drove top line, but more importantly, I would say, improved or didn't allow the economics and the profitability of the businesses to deteriorate.

If you look at our profitability in that business, 2024, 2025, where it was -- back in 2022, it had that impact. But the higher prices though have resulted now in what I see as kind of suppressing demand and lowering the volume growth. And the pressure on the volume growth accelerated, I'd say, as we moved throughout Q4 and consumers became increasingly more price sensitive. So as I said in my comment, it's not a sustainable path. You'll get down into the spiral. If you keep increasing prices, you'll keep on driving volume down.

So we could have gone a couple more quarters, maybe 9 more months doing this, but it would not be sustainable. And at some point, something fundamentally has to change here. And I just felt that the long we took to make this change, the more painful it would be. If I look at the strength of the portfolio right now and the growth, all the growth prospects we have, the ability to add a whole new growth vertical, I just thought that the timing was right to do this and do this as quickly as possible to get through it. So we began implementing price promotion initiatives that are going to help invigorate growth. I think early signs right now, Larry, are encouraging.

Obviously, we're going to have to keep monitoring that. And then we're also launching a lot of new products to be able to kind of support that volume growth. We haven't had to reallocate R&D resources to be able to do that. This is a business that operates around 2%, 2.2% of R&D. So we just reallocated within that budget to focus on new product development. So we'll have a couple of quarters here where growth in Nutrition is going to be challenged. And then in the second half, we'll return to positive growth. And I got confidence in the team that's in place today that we can execute this transition back to more of a volume base -- more of a volume-driven growth business.

If you look at what we did back in 2022, when we had the supply disruption, it took us about 9 to 12 months to get our share back. I don't think it's going to take that long. So I think it's about a 6-month process here of reshifting that. And that's really what's creating, I would say -- part of it what's creating a little bit of this first half, second half dynamic in our growth forecast.

But outside of that, Larry, versus where we were in October, nothing has really changed. In fact, I'd say a significant majority of the company here is either maintaining high single-digit top-line growth or low-teens growth or they're accelerating their growth versus 2025, whether it's our cardiovascular franchise, our diabetes products, EPD, our pharma business. We're going to be lapping the core diagnostic headwinds that we faced last year. If you remember, we had about $1 billion of headwind that we faced last year in our Diagnostic business, whether it was COVID and the China challenges. That's mostly going to be behind us.

We're going to be adding another high-growth vertical with Exact Sciences. So I think there's a lot to like here. I think there's a lot of growth here. And while we know we've got some work to do in Nutrition, I can guarantee you that we're not distracted by that from all the great opportunities that we have here. So like I said, I think we've got a good setup for 2026, a lot of accelerating growth as we progress through the year.

Our next question will come from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.

David Roman
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I did want to start, Robert, on the pipeline and then maybe just ask a follow-up question if we have time on the guidance and the outlook. You did talk about some of the approvals in the EP business. And most specifically, can you help us sort of frame the Abbott portfolio in EP? Maybe looking back 6 months, where we are today, where you are then 6 to 12 months from now and contextualize kind of the portfolio relative to competition and where you see the biggest opportunities to accelerate growth there with Volt, TactiFlex Duo, TactiFlex VT, I think even next-gen Agilis, EnSite X, et cetera.

Robert Ford
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. I mean I think that -- I do have to put that into context though. I mean if you go back 3 years, David, there was a lot of concern about our franchise that was growing double digits, that was going to be flat or even negative because we didn't have a PFA catheter. We developed a strategy. The team put together a strategy. We presented to our Board 3 years ago in terms of what we were going to do. And over the last couple of years, even without PFA products, we've been able to actually sustain our double-digit growth rate '24 and 2025 without a PFA catheter.

So the strategy that you're now referencing about our PFA products, that's just part of our strategy that we presented 3 years ago and laid out here. So we began launching the PFA product line in a much larger installed base of capital and mapping systems. The launch of Volt in Europe has gone very well.

I'd say when we talked about developing Volt, we said, let's look at where some of the shortcomings of our first-generation products are and can we build those into Volt. And the feedback that I continue to see from the European market and quite frankly, through the last couple of weeks as we began our limited market release here in the U.S. is, 2 things keep jumping out pretty continuously is: one, the elegance, the ease and the smoothness and the predictability of the mapping integrated with the catheter, the visualization, all of that, that we spend a lot of time putting together. I continue to hear very positive feedback on that. And then the ability to potentially do these procedures with sedation versus general anesthesia, that is a recurring theme that I keep on hearing here. So I'd say the Volt launch has gone very much aligned to what we expected as we were putting the program together.

This year, we'll have the launch of Volt here in the U.S. and TactiFlex Duo internationally. I think it comes down to -- we always wanted to make sure that we had a toolbox approach here for the physicians so they can have choice and they can have greater flexibility about how they use these products. I'm sure that there will be cases and types of patients and patient profiles that will lend itself more to a balloon and basket Volt-type design, and there are going to be types of patients and situations where TactiFlex Duo with its dual energy source will be preferred. And ultimately, it's going to be up to the physician to make those decisions, but I like the fact that the team as they put the strategy together that we would have both these products.

I think you raised this point very well, which is I don't think that there is a company right now that's better positioned in terms of the completeness of the portfolio than what we have, whether it's technology or the scale and the infrastructure, starting with the capital placements that we've got, the incredibly competent clinical specialists that we have out in the field that have shown their value to our customers right now.

We've got both RF and PFA products. We've got all the diagnostic elements, whether it's catheters, patches, et cetera, introducer sheaths, all of that, that you referenced. And on top of that, we've got an LAA device, which, I would say, is becoming pretty clear that if you want to be a leader in this space, you can't just look at having a PFA catheter, you got to have the full portfolio, including this device.

Right now, it seems like 25% of LAA procedures are done concomitantly. So I think if you put all of that together, the portfolio that we've assembled, combined with the resilience of what this team has done and how they've executed, I've got high expectations for this business this year. The team knows that. I expect that we should grow at least in line with the market, David, which I expect -- I think it seems like the forecast here is mid- to high teens.

So I think we're in a really good position, and I'm excited to see the second part of the strategy that we put together 3 years ago, and we're really excited to kind of put that second part of that phase into action now.

David Roman
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Very helpful. Maybe just a follow-up on the guidance. Look, I think we all know that you don't solve your guidance to meet short-term consensus and you are committed to achieving your commitments. But as you thought about putting together the outlook for 2026, considering some of the different variables that you faced over the past couple of quarters, like how did you think about risk adjusting the outlook? And maybe just help us think about the considerations in the guidance and maybe just your philosophy as you kind of put the outlook together here.

Robert Ford
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I mean, listen, I think if you look at our growth for 2026, I mean, we've always targeted high single digits and double digit -- high single-digit top line, double-digit bottom line. That's our investment identity, and we've kind of followed through with that. If you look at our 2026, I think the way you need to kind of look at it is you've got a very big portion of the company that is going to -- that we're sustaining that growth.

In some cases, it will be accelerating, but a large portion of the company is sustaining this high single-digit growth, whether it's in Cardiovascular, whether it's in Diabetes, we've got a bunch of new products launching to be able to support those kind of growth profiles in the business. EPD supporting with the biosimilar launch, that high single-digit kind of growth rate. So you've got large portions and even some geographies that we can sustain that growth, and we feel that we're supporting it with product launches and investment to sustain what I consider a pretty differentiated growth rate.

Then you've got the second bucket, which is, I'd say, an acceleration in our diagnostics. And all that really is, we've been doing very well, taking share in our Core Lab business across the world. And what -- we had a challenge with last year is with COVID coming down, in 2024, I think it was like $750 million coming down to $250 million. So you had $0.5 billion headwind there. And then you had another $400 million headwind in China VBP, right? Our forecast for COVID is around that same number, around $200 million. So I'm not expecting any significant growth or decline. And a lot of the VBP, they come in waves.

The vast majority of our sales in China have gone through the VBP in 2025. So we really felt that impact in 2025. There's going to be more VBPs in China, but the shares that we have in those waves are very, very small compared to what we have. So you've got this whole lapping of our Diagnostic business. And as long as we keep on doing what we're doing in United States and Europe and Latin America and other parts in Asia, which we have been doing, you're going to see a nice acceleration in our Diagnostic business. And you started to see that throughout the year as the VBP impact started to dissipate a little bit as the year progressed.

You've got then, obviously, as I spoke quite at length here about this transition with Nutrition, you've got probably 1 or 2 quarters here where our growth is going to be challenged. But I am confident that what we're going to be able to do here is reignite the volume growth, and you'll see that business get back to growth. So those elements there, Dave, really look at it and say, okay, you've got continued momentum in a large portion of the business. You've got some lapping that's going to be happening.

And then we've got this transition, which I consider to be pretty short term here of a couple of quarters, to be able to get to this guide on the Nutrition side. And then I'm sure we'll talk about Exact Sciences, but that's another factor here that you add on, a $3 billion-plus business growing 15%, with a lot of growth opportunities for us. So that's kind of how we looked at it at least from a top line. And then having that flow through down to the bottom line, making investments in the areas that we need to and nice gross margin and op margin profile expansion, too.

Our next question will come from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan.

Robert Marcus
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Two for me. Robert, last week, when we were talking, you said you expect CGM to continue to track higher at about $1 billion a year. That would put 2026 somewhere in the low to mid-teens. Is that the right way to think about CGM growth next year? And maybe if you just want to give your updated thoughts on market growth and Abbott's position there? And then I have a follow-up.

Robert Ford
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. When you said next year, you mean 2026, right?

Robert Marcus
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes.

Robert Ford
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I mean, I think -- yes, there's all debate that I read about that the market is slowing. And I get if you're just looking at percentages and that's how you base yourself off it, then I guess, if it's that myopic, then I think, okay, I understand the conclusion. But I don't consider growing $1 billion every single year and doing it 4 years in a row to be slowing down here, Robbie. I think the math will work out to what you just kind of highlighted there in the kind of low teens. But I think there's got a lot -- still a lot of opportunity for penetration in this, both from a market perspective, but then also from our opportunity, our ability to drive market share and market expansion.

I think that if you look at across all 3 patient groups, whether it's the intensive insulin user, the basal insulin user and the non-insulin user, all of those areas, still there's so much penetration to be able to have here. And you can see across the world, not just in the United States, but across the world, a lot of movement, whether it's patient groups, health care systems that are looking to expand the use and the adoption of the technology into all these patient segments.

I know the U.S. gets a lot of attention, and it's an important market, and there's a lot of great opportunities for us there in terms of the non-insulin user reimbursement opportunity. I continue to see nice progress in this process. There seems to be a lot of support to do this. And the data that we've shown, like we published 3 studies already that show that this patient segment also benefits with lower A1c, greater time in range, all the things that have driven kind of reimbursement in the other segments.

So I think that this is a very strong opportunity for us here in the U.S. And we'll see how it plays out. I think we'll see some language in the first half and then how it all plays out with comment periods. You know this, Robbie, there's comment periods, there's all of this. So I'm not baking that into my guidance, but I can tell you, we will be 150% ready to execute, whether it's having manufacturing capacity and having the scale and the position on the primary care side, which is where that will probably play out more, we'll be ready. So that provides an opportunity to outperform that consensus forecast.

I think on the intensive insulin user side, I still think there's penetration to be had and adoption to be had, especially in international markets. I think that's only about 50% penetrated. So I think there's still a lot of opportunity to do the work that we're doing there. Obviously, scale and cost matter in the international markets, and I think we've got that position set. And then as you look at what I think is more specific to us, the opportunity to bring in a very differentiated product to look at market share shift in a segment that I'd say we're probably a little bit underrepresented from a market share perspective, which is on the pumper side with the launch of our GKS sensor.

I think that's going to provide us a great opportunity. I'm not going to try and pinpoint the exact quarter here, Robbie. When we get approval, we'll issue the press release and we'll be out. But we've been working hard already concomitantly with the regulatory process with KOLs, with physician groups, with payers. And I think there was an article that came out in the Lancet in January talking about -- beginning of this year, talking about the importance of measuring continuously ketones as DKA still a -- is still a major care gap here for people with diabetes. So I think you've got a big opportunity here with this product for market share conversion.

I think one of the surprising things for me in this as we started to really double-click on these patient segments is we talked about the SGLT2 population. So we did some analysis in the U.S. You got about 6 million SGLT2 users in the U.S. And if you cross reference their usage of CGM through all the databases, only about 1 million of those 6 million are on CGMs. So I think there's going to be an opportunity here also to kind of create market expansion with this product. So not just share capture, but also market expansion. So this market is still very robust.

It's becoming larger. So I get the law of big numbers kind of lowers those percentages. But if you just look at it from a penetration perspective, Robbie, there's still so much to do in all these segments in different geographies that we're still very excited and making big investments, whether it's in sales and marketing, clinical, R&D and manufacturing because we still think that this is still -- I'm not going to say it's the first or second inning, but we're far away from being from the seventh inning on this one. So I think there's still a lot of opportunity here, and we're in a good position.

Robert Marcus
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. Maybe just a quick follow-up. It's great to see you're still able to do double-digit EPS growth in 2026. I would imagine that's coming through the top line and margin expansion. How should we think about the magnitude of margin expansion and the drivers of it?

Robert Ford
Chairman, President & CEO

I'll let Phil take that.

Philip Boudreau
CFO & Executive VP of Finance

Yes. Thanks, Robbie. I couldn't be more proud of what the team accomplished in 2025. As Robert outlined, overcoming uncertainties, volatilities and whatnot to still drive margin expansion. And that commitment to the execution and excellence there maintains in 2026, expect to do more of the same, focus on the things that are strategically aligned and the execution here to where we continue to look at a 50 to 70 basis point improvement in operating margins every year, and that's kind of what we've got built into this and fully expect we'll do that through both gross margin expansion as we've done, but continue to gain leverage in the P&L where appropriate. So that's kind of how we've constructed that double-digit earnings.

Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI.

Vijay Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

My first one maybe on the product side. AVEIR, like you mentioned, another double-digit quarter. Just curious on where are we from a penetration standpoint, what innings are we in? And how durable is this double-digit growth in a category that's a pacemaker [indiscernible] low single-digit growth category and you guys are doing double digits?

Robert Ford
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. Well, I made some comments about -- we look at this Rhythm Management, $10 billion market, as actually an opportunity to grow. So we have been making our investments. AVEIR, obviously, is a big driver of that, but we're making investments in other areas of the portfolio to kind of be able to support our ability to take market share and grow at a differentiated rate here.

To your question on penetration, listen, the global low voltage or pacing segment market is around $5 billion, whatever, $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion, depending on what you're looking at. But let's just call it $5 billion. I'd say AVEIR is about 10% of that right now. So early innings here for us for sure.

And as I said previously, when we began this process, I wasn't interested in just getting a flash in a pan sales growth for like a year or 6 quarters. So we really worked hard and the team did an incredible job to really establish a new standard of care and get physicians trained. It's a different type of implant. So what we're seeing here is really nice growth in places that 1 year, 1.5 years ago, we began the training process and really seeing really strong penetration there.

If you look at just single chamber, I think right now, the U.S. single-chamber pacing, which is about 15% of the total market, that's about 50% penetrated. So there's still a long opportunity here in the U.S. and quite frankly, globally, too. So I think the team has done an incredible job here.

We've launched new products. We'll continue to launch new products in this space. And we think that this is the next standard in CRM is these devices that are communicating with each other, that can be implanted [ transfemorally ] and don't use leads. The clinical evidence in terms of what they're able to deliver is pretty impressive right now. So I think it's -- I think we've got a lot of investment here that will support this type of differentiated growth rate.

Vijay Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

That's helpful, Robert. And my follow-up on -- or I guess the second question is on capital allocation. Any updated thoughts on Exact deal close timing? Dilution, I think you mentioned $0.20. When you think about your leverage levels, it's still -- post deal, it will still be pretty modest. You still have capacity. I'm curious when you think about M&A versus divestitures or spin-offs, MedTech right now seems to be -- spin-off seems to be the flavor of the season. I'm curious how you're thinking about those decisions.

Robert Ford
Chairman, President & CEO

You put a lot into that one there, Vijay. Let me see if I can unpack that. I think from a capital allocation perspective, I've always been pretty consistent with our approach. I don't have a formula that X percent goes here, Y percent goes there. We are committed to a growing dividend, and we did that again for 2026 when we announced our dividend back in December. So we're growing our dividend. But outside of that, we'll allocate our capital in terms of what we believe is the best balance between short term and long term for our shareholders where we can create value.

Regarding M&A, listen, my focus right now is integration, closing Exact Science and integration. That's going to be my primary focus. I think post close, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio will be around 2.7x. So to your point, we still have plenty of capacity. But I think in the near term, I'd say focus on integrating Exact Sciences. And if there's opportunities for us to add, there are probably more tuck-in type size deals to take advantage of.

Regarding the status right now of Exact, I think we're making great progress towards closing. We've submitted all of our required clearances over here. There's a shareholder vote on the 20th of February. So right now, I'm not changing any assumption regarding timing of close or kind of EPS impact. And as we integrate and as we put -- as we integrate the business, then we'll go updating it as we go along. But right now, there's no change in terms of timing and in terms of dilution.

So I read your note last night, Vijay. I thought that you would have been asking a question about multi-cancer early detection and the opportunity that exists. I largely agree with your report. I think this is going to be another great opportunity for us. And it's one that, as we looked at the deal, said, okay, greater reimbursement of this type of test will really make this a very, very large segment.

I think the way I see this is the same way that we have our lipid panel test every year, the same way that we do a cardiometabolic panel or a white and red blood count panel every year after a certain age. I believe that if the product is right and performs right and it's priced the right way, I just envision this being that type of test. So I think that if that becomes the case, I think your forecast is way undercalled even on the upper side.

Our next question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS.

Danielle Antalffy
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And Robert, just two questions for you on Nutrition. I appreciate all that you're saying about the strategy there going forward. But I guess first part of the question is what gives you confidence that these are the right prices that you're landing at today to drive that volume increase? Like did you guys do [indiscernible] global. So I imagine it differs by market.

And then the second question is now -- and tell me if I'm wrong here, but presumably, Nutrition has a different profitability profile. And maybe talk about whether -- how it changes your view about how this fits into the entire Abbott portfolio?

Robert Ford
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. Regarding the pricing, so we did some pricing work just before Thanksgiving, in time for what usually is a pretty busy kind of retail activity. And -- so we did different testing here in the United States. We did different testing internationally also. We got the results back on the U.S. side pretty quickly. You get to see the impact pretty quickly. And like I said in the comments, I think the early signs are encouraging.

But I also said, hey, we got to keep monitoring this. You got to keep monitoring it for the consumer. You got to keep monitoring it for competitive activities. But I think right now, based on what we have, I think we've kind of called it right. And regarding kind of allocating expenses, listen, we don't have a cookie-cutter approach across all the businesses. It always depends on momentum, opportunity, the balance of the short and the long term.

And so we take a very kind of detailed view in terms of how we're allocating. Yes, the profitability has improved in this business. I'd say it's probably, from a profile perspective, going to be in line with what it was in 2025. We've obviously got to make some adjustments in our spend level and learn how to spend a little bit better, and we did that also in Q4, shifting some of the focus from kind of marketing and brand to a little bit more kind of price and promotion, at least for these next 6 months. And that way, we're able to at least kind of maintain a kind of steady profile over here.

Our next question will come from Matt Taylor from Jefferies.

Matthew Taylor
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

So I wanted to start with diagnostics and see if you could unpack some of the dynamics there a little bit more. You touched on the China headwinds in VBP and mentioned some smaller programs or categories there. What's the outlook like for Diagnostics in China? It does seem like the rest of the world is doing fairly well. But what do you foresee for China growth this year and next in Diagnostics?

Robert Ford
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, specifically in diagnostics, like I said, I think we've gone through what I would consider the bulk of our VBP based on the strength and the market share we have in the different assays. The way they're going about this is they're just looking at categories of assays and then kind of implementing it. And the first 2 were the ones that we had over 40%, 45% market share in those markets. So we kind of felt that pretty significantly.

I think the next big area of VBP is going to be in the -- on the -- just your regular kind of core lab oncology testing, and we have very little market share over there. So listen, we put a new management team in place there, put our most experienced commercial person that is driving that business.

We've done a lot of work there between working with our distributors, segmenting the market, looking at our product portfolio, looking at different types of product offerings, new product offering versus legacy product offering. So I think the teams have done a really good job there. And my expectation with that business going forward is, listen, I'm not expecting big growth out of it. All I need for it is to be pretty stable. And it being stable, I get to have the other parts of the portfolio that are accelerating. Our U.S. business has actually done better than what it's done in the past. So we're capturing market share over there.

Our Latin America business is doing better than what it's done in the past, capturing market share there. Our European businesses continue to grow. We've got a good position over there. So I'd say the outlook of that business is, we will be, I'd say, mid-single-digit growth this year versus kind of where we were in 2025. And if you remove China -- again, this is a full year view, if you remove China, then you're in that kind of 7% to 8% kind of range.

So I don't like doing that, Matt, because China is part of our business. So -- but you'll see an acceleration even with China just because it's a little bit more stable versus where it was last year.

Matthew Taylor
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. And maybe I could just ask a follow-up on diabetes. You talked about some optimism for the outlook for the market and specifically around the non-insulin type 2 coverage. We've seen the guidelines change and so you definitely see the potential for that coverage to expand significantly. You mentioned you've seen some progress in the process. And I guess I was wondering how you think that could play out in the first half of the year? What forms the new coverage could take or any other thoughts that you have on that?

Robert Ford
Chairman, President & CEO

I don't want to get ahead of myself. What I can tell you is, listen, there's definitely support. There's support from the ADA, there's support from other physician groups, okay? And there's support because the clinical data is backing that support up, right? I mentioned that we've got 3 studies that we did with that patient segment, and it shows this improved A1c and this better time in range. So I think the support is backed up by clinical evidence. And you've got a U.S. HHS and CMS that sees the value of this type of technology, sees the value of being proactive in managing your health, even if you're not taking medications or you're not taking insulin, bringing this type of technology improves outcomes.

So you have a receptive CMS, let's call it like that. Like I said, I think you're going to see some sort of language, Matt, first half, okay? But I know how these things go. We've gone through them so many different times in different parts of the product. Language will come out, then there'll be a 90-day comment period, and then there will be a 60-day period to be able to evaluate it.

And right now, could that be a different process? There could be a different process. It could be a much shorter comment period. It could be a much shorter implementation time line because there is this support and desire to bring this to more people. But like I said, I'm not going to bake that in just yet, but I am being prepared. I mean the team is prepared. I mean if it happened next week, I'd tell you they'd be prepared.

So we're doing a lot of work there. I think the key aspect as you think about that expansion is that it's going to happen predominantly in primary care. So how well are you set up? How well is your sales force deployed? How well is your integration into the health care systems with Epic and other? So that's going to be an important part.

And outside of that, I think we should just be, I think, very enthused -- I'm very enthusiastic that this will happen. Whether it happens in the second quarter, the third quarter, for me, like I'm thinking about this, this is going to be a huge opportunity for this market, not just in the U.S. but globally for years and years to come. So let's just get it right.

Our next question will come from Travis Steed from BofA Securities.

Travis Steed
BofA Securities, Research Division

Maybe to spend some time talking about in MedTech kind of the macro procedure environment, given some of the worries on ACA subsidies. And then I'll just go ahead and throw my second question out. When you think about for total Abbott and growth over 2026, should we think about more Q1 first half being more in line with kind of the Q4 growth and then improve from there over the second half?

Robert Ford
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So -- yes, I think that's probably good. I mean I think -- sometimes these puts and takes, it kind of just masks -- sometimes it feels like you're better than what you are because you're lapping something. So I tend to look at it also on a 2-year stack basis. So if you look at it on a 2-year stack basis, it looks pretty -- there is some acceleration in Q3 and Q4, but not to the extent without -- just on a 1-year basis. But I think that's the right way to look at it. Obviously, we're always striving to do better, but I think it's a good starting point.

What was your other question? On MedTech volumes?

Travis Steed
BofA Securities, Research Division

Yes.

Robert Ford
Chairman, President & CEO

Listen, I think I read some report that there were some concerns about MedTech volumes in Q4. We just reported our Q4. You're going to have a bunch of MedTech companies that will report over the next couple of weeks. I would be extremely surprised if you hear that volumes were short in Q4.

Our volumes are really good in Q4 across all of our categories, even what is considered -- what we call more foundational or traditionally more slower growth kind of segments. So I think the evidence on our print and our guide is not suggesting that the MedTech volumes are slowing. And I think there continues to be -- given the innovation that's happening in the space, given the clinical evidence that's being generated with that innovation, I still see this as a very attractive segment, not just for this year or next quarter, but for many, many years to come.

Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citi.

Joanne Wuensch
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I think I'm allowed to still say Happy New Year. Two questions on -- I'll put them right upfront. EPD has sort of held up there in high single digits pretty consistently, but the macro landscape is getting a little bit more complicated as we sit still here. I'd be curious if you see anything that we need to sort of be aware of over the next 12 -- maybe 12 to 18 months?

And then my second question has to do with Structural Heart. It looks like your multiple products, we'll call them multiple shots on goal, is keeping that growth rate going nicely. Anything you want to call out in particular or anything we should be looking at for the upcoming medical meetings?

Robert Ford
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. Regarding EPD, yes, I mean, I think this team is incredibly resilient. And I get that there is some concern about geopolitics going forward, but let's face it, Joanne. There's been macro challenges, at least since I've been in this role for the last 5 years. And so I -- yes, we've got to pay attention to them. Yes, we've got to navigate, but I'm going to rely heavily on a team that has shown that they can actually do that and do that in pretty difficult circumstances already and continue to be able to drive the business in that 7%, 8%, 9% range here.

So yes, we got to be mindful of it, but this is a team that, at least in these markets, have proved to be very resilient, have deep connections in the market, deep relationships clinical distribution-wise. So -- and now that we're bringing our biosimilar portfolio into these markets, biosimilars are now the fastest-growing generic kind of segment, I feel good about this business.

I think the idea of bringing this differentiated portfolio into a team that has done extremely well in navigating all of this, I think we've got also strong aspirations for this business. So yes, we'll keep an eye on out, but I don't think that it's something completely new for us or this business. We operate in 160 countries. We're truly a global company. So we will have to figure it out.

And then I think your question on Structural Heart. Yes, I mean, this is an area that we've invested heavily over the last couple of years. We've developed a, what I would consider, best-in-class portfolio across all 3 valves. And I think we've got a lot of upcoming growth catalysts that will move its way through.

I think the -- got great new products with Navitor, TriClip, Amulet. Most of these on the early -- are, I believe, still in their early cycle. You guys always would ask me about like when will MitraClip grow -- will get back to growth? I just clearly say we did double-digit growth in MitraClip. I think that's a result of some of the guideline changes that we're seeing and kind of reigniting some of the growth here in the U.S.

But we've got a lot of opportunity. We've got a lot of things going on in this business. We had label expansions in Navitor and MitraClip, got a next-generation repair technology coming out with both MitraClip and TriClip, our fifth generation. I mentioned guideline changes to MitraClip and TriClip that's having an impact. We just got approval or got approval for TriClip in Japan. That's a whole new market for us that we see a huge opportunity, a big opportunity for us, and we're launching that as we speak in Q1.

We've done some bolt-on M&A in this business. I think I mentioned this last time. We acquired a company called LARALAB, which is an AI-powered imaging interventional cardiology company that's -- we're integrating that into our product offerings now for pre-procedural planning. So I think that's going to help also since imaging is such an important part in these procedures.

And then the pipeline looks really good, too. We've got our next-generation Amulet, expect to be launching that beginning of next year. We're going to go into trial -- into our IDE trial with our balloon TAVR in the second half of this year. So again, as I'm thinking about -- I know what's going to launch in 2027, and I know the impact that those launches are going to have in terms of our growth rate, and we're building our pipeline to be able to ensure that we can sustain that growth in 2028. And I look at this balloon TAVR program as really being important to do that.

And then we're also going to start our -- an IDE trial for our transfemoral transseptal mitral valve replacement program, too, which I think is going to be best-in-class. So I think this team has got not only an incredible pipeline to work with, but we've also been making the investments on the clinical side, clinical teams, sales reps across the world. So I think we're well positioned in our Structural Heart business.

Crystal, we'll take one more question, please.

And our last question will come from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen.

Joshua Jennings
TD Cowen, Research Division

Just keep it to one on capital allocation, sorry to circle back. But I think the focus for your team, Robert, has been to kind of look at inorganic adds for the devices and diagnostics franchise that played out in -- with the Exact acquisition. I mean should we be thinking that, that remains the focus? Or is the Nutrition recovery -- can that business get back to mid-single-digit growth without any external business development initiatives?

Robert Ford
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. Yes. Listen, I'd say the capital allocation regarding M&A and kind of our focus is going to be in those 2 areas, right? MedTech and Diagnostics is where we see an opportunity. I don't consider a need for inorganic in our Nutrition business to execute the strategy that I just described, which is to place a lot more emphasis on volume growth.

I think we've got the right products, the right brands and the right teams in place to be able to kind of do that. I think the biggest investment that we're making is we're seeing the impact of that now, which is addressing kind of price points and doing it comprehensively across the world so that we can get everything kind of reignited back to volume growth. So I'd say that's the focus, is MedTech and Diagnostics. So I don't think anything changes there.

I'll just close here with a few comments. Listen, we've got -- I think we delivered a pretty strong year in 2025. Obviously, there are challenges. There will always be challenges. We delivered on our original EPS target of double digit, healthy margin expansion. I think I've spent some time on this call talking about our pipeline and how we think about our pipeline and ensuring that we have a nice cadence of pipeline going forward, not just what we're launching this year, but what we're investing in this year so that we can be ready to launch in '27 and '28.

So I think the pipeline has been very productive. And we took a very important strategic step to shape Abbott for the future with the announcement of the Exact Science acquisition. I think that's going to add a whole new growth vertical for Abbott. And I think that cancer diagnostics is going to be a very important clinical and medical need for society -- for global society. So I think we're going to be well positioned there, and I feel good about the timing and everything that we put in place there.

So as we transition to 2026, I think I highlighted here, we've got a lot of businesses that are going to sustain what I would consider pretty differentiated growth rates, high single digits, teens, and we can support those with the investments we made and the product launches that we've got. And then we've got some large businesses that are going to be having some inflection points and some acceleration, whether it's Core Lab or even our Electrophysiology business here.

So I feel good about what we've got put in -- and what we've laid out here in terms of our plan. Obviously, we strive to do better than that, and there's opportunities to do better than that. But I think as we sit here in January, this is a good starting point. And with that, I'll wrap up, and thank you for joining us.
