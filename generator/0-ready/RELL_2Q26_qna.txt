Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Bobby Brooks from Northland.

Robert Brooks
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

You mentioned how overall GES backlog declined, but that core backlog grew. Could you just discuss what would be considered core backlog versus noncore?

Gregory Peloquin
Executive Vice President of Power & Microwave Technologies Group

Sure, Bobby. This is Greg. So the backlog -- so sales were up 39% and backlog was down $57,000. That's not too bad. You grow 39% your backlog only decreases $57,000. So when I talk about core backlog, we have the products that you and I have talked about, the Pitch Energy Modules and everything else. We also have a group of customers that are -- we're selling components into that are building Green Energy products. It's a much smaller portion of GES, but that's what we call the noncore and that book-to-bill was down. But if you look at the core business, which is 95% of it, the book-to-bill was 1.10 on 39% growth and of course, 15% above that. So we're very excited about the business -- core business that we talked to you about that you know about. Those are the products that are growing.

Robert Brooks
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful and really good to hear. And then maybe what's -- what's the right way to think about cadence of orders turning to backlog and then revenues within GES? Like are there certain product lines that can be booked and shipped inter-quarter? And that maybe was a dynamic that spurred the strong GES sales in the quarter?

Gregory Peloquin
Executive Vice President of Power & Microwave Technologies Group

Exactly, Bobby. So as these products come out, they go from alpha beta to production, and then once that happens, you see we have new customers every quarter, new sales. And so that business is what led to the growth. And as you know, we're expanding that model, which is about 85% North America, expanding it into Europe. So we had wins in Europe that we booked and then wins in Asia that we booked. So that core business that we talk about that's growing quite heavily, and we continue to get new customers and backlog. So we're starting to understand what the annual usage is. And so we're trying to get ahead of the game and build products for stock. It's a guessing game. They do give us a forecast, but they're terrible forecast.

So in Q2, we did ship a lot of product from stock. So that's a book-to-bill of 1. That's flat bookings or backlog, and that's where you saw it. So the team has done a great job working with these key customers, trying to develop their annual needs. And then when they come in for 1,000 units, just kind of out of the blue Bobby, I know a couple of those were able to ship from stock. So that's how it's working. And we're continuing to try to make sure we have inventories so we can ship from stock. But in a very positive way, we're seeing higher demand than what we're building.

Our next question will come from the line of Anja Soderstrom from Sidoti.

Anja Soderstrom
Sidoti & Company, LLC

So I'm just curious with the GE approval list for the [ ULTRA1000 ], where do you -- and what kind of opportunity could that present?

Gregory Peloquin
Executive Vice President of Power & Microwave Technologies Group

Say it again, Anja. For the what product?

Anja Soderstrom
Sidoti & Company, LLC

The [ ULTRA1000 ] for the GE approval list.

Wendy Diddell
Executive VP, COO & Director

I think Anja is asking about the GE, where do we stand with GE getting approval for the -- for your ULTRA3000.

Gregory Peloquin
Executive Vice President of Power & Microwave Technologies Group

Okay, yes. So...

Anja Soderstrom
Sidoti & Company, LLC

Okay. I am sorry, just mixed up.

Gregory Peloquin
Executive Vice President of Power & Microwave Technologies Group

So Anja, we have GE approval. We're the featured product on their Internet site or their marketplace product. What -- we're not driving this. This is being driven by their customers. So NextEra and Invenergy has been pushing GE because they have a handful of sites where they're using GE services to do maintenance and service. And so all we need to do is have GE. We're going to send them some product, and they're going to try to literally blow it up. I mean it's all about what this product will do so they can improve it from a safety point of view. From a performance point of view and working in their turbines, that's already been approved, that's already done. So we've been going back and forth with an NDA. I've worked for a $30 billion big company -- for the $30 billion company before, and it just -- it takes time. So we have an agreed NDA. We signed it. We sent it back to them. We're expecting it back.

But I will tell you, Anja, these people aren't waiting. In fact, we booked a large number of business that they said, you know what, will outsource this ourselves. We won't use GE services to install these Ultra3000s, which we've been buying for other sites for 3 or 4 years. So it really right now, I don't see it being a slowdown of any sort. We have more than enough business right now. It will be an upside. But I wouldn't doubt if they just say, you know what, we're not going to use your services to do our Pitch Energy Modules because these things are such a cost savings to these owner operators and they eliminate a huge problem that they have, I don't think they're going to wait for this.

So this is being driven by GE's customers. We're just supporting it. But again, we finally have an agreed NDA because I'm not sending them any product without an NDA. We're going to send them products here this quarter, they'll test them, and then they'll say, okay, their service group can install these into the turbines. But it's interesting, some of these owner operators aren't waiting for them. They're just doing it themselves and installing it themselves or outsourcing it.

Anja Soderstrom
Sidoti & Company, LLC

Okay. That was helpful. And then what's kind of margin impact does the medical have. What kind of opportunity do you see there as you conclude that supply agreement?

Wendy Diddell
Executive VP, COO & Director

Okay. So this is Wendy. Year-to-date, the overall hit to the gross margin in PMT has been almost negligible. It's about a 0% gross margin, so we're not experiencing a huge hit there. It's the addition of the SG&A. And on a year-to-date basis, while we're doing better than we anticipated with that, we still are losing money. As we mentioned in the call, we anticipate finishing up the ALTA tube production in the third quarter. And when we conclude that, and we're focusing then strictly on the repair of the Siemens tubes. We expect that to turn to a profitable bottom line contribution. So I'm estimating, we're estimating at this point that, that will begin in Q1 of FY '27, but we're going to do everything we can to pull that into Q4.

Anja Soderstrom
Sidoti & Company, LLC

And then you're sitting on some cash, and we expect cash flow to improve as you are finishing building up the inventory for the powergrid tubes. What do you plan to do with all the cash?

Wendy Diddell
Executive VP, COO & Director

Well, I'll jump in first and then Ed and Bob can also contribute. The first thing we always remind everybody, Anja, the cash is spread out throughout the world. And I believe today, about 70% of it sits outside the United States in various legal entities. And that cash has to stay there. So while it looks like -- I mean, $33 million is a great number, and we're going to continue to focus on growing that. Please do remember that some of that is not in the United States. So we're going to continue investing in the growth initiatives primarily in the alternative or green energy solutions part of the business. We -- Greg mentioned the Sweetwater, Texas facility and improving our new product development cycle. We're looking at some additional both sales and engineering resources that support that business.

So we really want to hold that money that we have in the United States for those type of investments. We are continuing to be very opportunistic and open-minded about small acquisitions. Those would be ones that would be easily bolted on. Again, focused primarily in alternative or power management and focused in areas where they bring in engineering or some type of product that is unique or exclusive to the market. So those are the areas where we're really holding our cash. Ed and Bob may want to add to that.

Robert Ben
Executive VP, CFO, Chief Accounting Officer & Corporate Secretary

I can add to that. Anja, it's Bob Ben. Just to let you know, we do -- the cash that we have on hand that we're not necessarily using on a daily basis. We have invested in various money markets, and we're getting an average yield of about 4% right now, just under $10 million of our total cash is invested in that. And so we are doing that and that's what you see on the income statement as investment income, which is located in the other income section of our income statement.

Anja Soderstrom
Sidoti & Company, LLC

And then a last question in terms of the semiconductor. What do you see there? And do you still expect that to pick up in the second half of '26?

Wendy Diddell
Executive VP, COO & Director

In the semi fab equipment market. Is that your question Anja?

Anja Soderstrom
Sidoti & Company, LLC

Yes.

Wendy Diddell
Executive VP, COO & Director

Yes, absolutely. From all of our customers in that market segment, they are anticipating solid growth through the rest of calendar year 2026 and beyond. And we're starting to see some of that in our more near-term forecast.

Operator

Our next question will come from the line of [ Chip Rui from Rui Asset Management ].

Unknown Analyst

I want to follow up on the semi question that was just asked. I mean it seems memory has gone from dead on arrival to the hottest thing out there. I know you've not exclusively memory on your both sides. But has there been a cadence shift with what your customers have talked about. I know last quarter, Ed said you would finally kind of work through kind of end customer inventory. Can you just give us a little bit more visibility on perhaps a cyclical recovery there? It seems you're still a little low from a revenue and earnings point of view, but historically a large contributor for the company. So kind of when you say there's a better outlook, is it inflected positively? Or are you still hoping it will inflect positively? A little more color on that would be great.

Wendy Diddell
Executive VP, COO & Director

So I'll start on that, [ Chip ]. So as I mentioned, we're starting to see stronger forecast for our Q3 and Q4. Bear in mind that the forecasting is not always the best and it tends to bounce around a lot as we've been discussing really for the last couple of years. But we do see, again, across multiple customers within that channel their input to us is get ready. We are ready. We have the resources. We have the space. It's not going to cost us a lot of money in terms of realizing upside. I also want to point out that on a year-to-date basis, Q1, Q2, we're still up considerably over prior year's first 2 quarters. So we are cautiously to more than cautiously optimistic about Q3 and Q4, and we're ready. So I don't know if that answers your question, maybe you could follow up if you have anything more you want to know.

Unknown Analyst

No, that's helpful. It's just -- I know it's up a little bit, but we're still -- it seems like the industry is gearing for a pretty big upcycle. And even though you're up, you're still nowhere near where you were a couple of years ago. So hopefully, it's some upside. And then I'll just make a comment on the buyback. I've never pushed you guys your buyback. I understand where your cash is globally. But everybody on the call was bullish across the board this morning from pitch energy, not only with GE to global, it seems semi is getting better. You've got new product development. It seems to me the enterprise is inflecting positively on multiple levels, yet your stock is once again down and the analysts are focused on backlog and sequential margin.

I know you don't have a lot of cash, but $3 million or $4 million of that cash could be a couple of percent of your market cap. You also have an undrawn revolver, which would be in the U.S. My recommendation is carpe diem. I mean if there's a time to buy stock, it's when it's down and when people don't see the vision that you guys see. It seems to me if what you're saying comes to fruition, this is just an incredible opportunity. So I'll leave that as a comment.

Wendy Diddell
Executive VP, COO & Director

Thanks, [ Chip ]. We appreciate the input.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our next question will come as a follow-up from Bobby Brooks from Northland Capital.

Robert Brooks
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

Could we maybe just discuss the growth initiatives that you guys launched a couple of quarters ago and kind of how those are progressing in a little bit more detail? Just curious to hear more on that.

Wendy Diddell
Executive VP, COO & Director

Are you referring specifically to the made in America program or specific products under Green Energy?

Robert Brooks
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

Just kind of broadly any growth initiatives that came -- that kind of step from the cash that you got from some of the health care business.

Gregory Peloquin
Executive Vice President of Power & Microwave Technologies Group

I can talk a little bit about the PMG and the PMT and GES business. So as you know, Bobby, the growth initiatives were: one, to expand internationally, the product; two, implement our energy storage system program and continue to add new products. And all of those were successful in the past 2 quarters. So on the global expansion, as I think we've talked about, we now have orders and have shipped orders into Asia and Europe. We are coming out 3 new product -- I'm sorry, 2 new products in Q2 from our new Sweetwater design center that are already in beta testing with a couple of very large owner operators. So we'll introduce those and we fully expect to start receiving bookings for that.

And on the ESS side, we rolled it out. We have technology partners. And in December, we booked our first order for energy storage system with the town or the city or city of Goleta, California for their water waste treatment facility. We will also be supplying the solar panels for that and the energy storage system. Through that process, it kind of confirmed that our niche approach going after utility and small -- comparatively small, very large to us, 2-megawatt type systems. That was booked in December. And we have a list of other ones that we're pursuing in quoting. These quotes are 10 to 15 pages a piece. But we're still very excited about our strategy in terms of technology partners that component business grew. Our Engineered Solutions business grew. We've added new products.

And then the BES thing as we grow it, we really feel strongly, especially for the State of Illinois, once that demo center is in place and people can see it. See how it works and see we would train them and educate them on how to get all these rebates that the State of Illinois gives the best in the nation, even better than California. So those are our main initiatives, and we have traction. I'm not a patient person. It's never been one of my attributes of the few I have. But we continue to push, and we continue to every month, get some sort of success and a handful of indications that we have the right strategy, the right technology partners and a real niche that we found in these multibillion-dollar markets.

Wendy Diddell
Executive VP, COO & Director

And Bobby, I would just add to that -- okay, go ahead.

Robert Brooks
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

No, you go. You go.

Wendy Diddell
Executive VP, COO & Director

I was just going to add in terms of other investment areas. When you look at our SG&A, you're going to see that's relatively flat. Our headcount is flat. What we're doing there is as we have normal turnover, we are reallocating those resources to the high-growth areas that Greg just went through. So you're not -- no one should expect a huge pop in the SG&A as a result of these investments. We've talked about the spend on the Thales inventory, and that should be ramping up. So that's one area where we've continued to spend some money. On CapEx, Bob mentioned in his script that we've made some necessary facility and IT improvements. We also added a second PC board layout facility here, which is playing in nicely with the made in America initiative that we launched a couple of quarters ago. So in general, I think what you're going to see is us moving some things around, again, rationalizing and gaining efficiency from a lot of the people and the resources that we already have.

Robert Brooks
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

That's great to hear. And then just one clarification, Greg, in your opening remarks, you kind of mentioned some tailwinds in the PMT business and some -- and what seemed to be some headwinds in the business as well, like that occurred intra-quarter. Could you just expand or talk about that again and maybe expand on it a little bit more? Or -- and maybe I was missing the ball, too.

Gregory Peloquin
Executive Vice President of Power & Microwave Technologies Group

Yes. I mean I don't know of any substantial tailwinds in PMT. We obviously have a good grasp on the semiconductor market. We have seen some strong revenue and bookings on the RF and wireless side. We're seeing -- and just a reminder, Bobby, at one time before we sold it, that group was up to $0.5 billion. So we know that market very well, and we have a lot of relationships, and we have probably some of the best RF and wireless suppliers in the world. And we're really seeing some traction again in the quarter from a tailwind point of view in the SATCOM and actually drone markets. And so that was a nice pickup for PMT anyway in terms of sales. It's lower-margin business. It's demand creation, but it's components are made by our technology partners. So that maybe is somewhat of a tailwind in terms of where we saw some upside in PMT and where we will see some upside going forward.

Wendy, I'm at Mayo Clinic, everybody. I got -- I have to go a -- meet with my surgeon. However, the last time I was here it was 3.5 years ago with a hip replacement and a half hour after that surgery, I got a call from NextEra with a $10 million order. So I might stay here the weekend and see if I can pick something else up. All right, Wendy.

Wendy Diddell
Executive VP, COO & Director

Thanks, Greg.

Our next question will come from the line of Ross Taylor from ARS Investment Partners.

Porter Taylor
ARS Investment Partners, LLC

A couple of quick questions. One, with regard to the semi-cap equipment space, have you guys built prebuilt product for that, it's something on your work in progress or your finished goods inventory line there that you've been -- because you've been preparing for this for some time. It seems that they have been a little slow getting the pull-through.

Wendy Diddell
Executive VP, COO & Director

Ross, yes, we do that where we can. I think we've described the business before as being very high mix, low volume. So it's not the type -- it's not like the ULTRA PEMs or the ULTRA3000s where we can build them. It's all the same products. So we don't have the kind of inventory that maybe you envision of having thousands on the shelf ready to go. But we have good exposure and good track record in terms of what the demand is. And we are certainly doing everything we can to make sure that when those orders come in, they go out almost instantaneously. So little bit of a mixed answer there for you.

Porter Taylor
ARS Investment Partners, LLC

Okay. And that's still should be -- historically, it's been -- think about your highest margin business. And I would assume that should you get back to more aggressive run rates, that would return.

Wendy Diddell
Executive VP, COO & Director

It's a good business for us.

Porter Taylor
ARS Investment Partners, LLC

Okay. Another quick question. Can you talk about -- give more color on the battery storage opportunities? And what kind of magnitude, what kind of time line are we looking at in that space because it's a fairly -- I mean, it seems to be a very important area we're seeing, whether it's AI data centers or quite honestly, just even factors or others given the nature of the grid.

Wendy Diddell
Executive VP, COO & Director

So Greg, just dropped off, Ross, that would be an area for him to address. But what we can tell you is that his list of opportunities continues to grow. They range right now in size, magnitude anywhere between maybe $0.5 million on the small end to a couple of million or more on the large end. He is focused and the team is focused heavily in the industrial and commercial market, more of the let's look at it as kind of Tier 2, not the data AI centers per se. Those might be a little bit bigger than what we're planning to build. But it's an area where we've seen a lot of strong interest particularly in the states that Greg mentioned where the states are still providing a lot of incentives. But I don't think anybody can pick up anything and read anything without seeing the growth in energy storage requirements. So we fully plan to take advantage of that. And we'll try to bring some more color to that in the next call.

Porter Taylor
ARS Investment Partners, LLC

Okay. And do you think -- one like philosophical, you and I've had this question, one of the things that this company has struggled with is it's historically been more of a project-based business. Do you see some of these things we're talking about here, becoming basically run rate businesses where we can kind of see a more steady annual flow through in top and bottom line?

Wendy Diddell
Executive VP, COO & Director

I think you see that already. Certainly, you see that in EDG. We've talked about that. I think you're seeing it in the green energy piece with the wind. And I would expect that not only to continue to grow as we expand both the customer base and the geographic area that we cover. I think those -- I call those bread-and-butter items. I love them because to your point, they're going out on a regular cadence. Some of the train, the EV rail, the -- for example, the starter modules those will be more steady run rate. But we always are focusing on and trying to focus on products that will apply to a much broader market, not simply one customer or one program.

Porter Taylor
ARS Investment Partners, LLC

And obviously, success there would be, I think, important. It would take away a lot of the volatility in earnings. And I will offer my comment on buyback. I think my position on it is well known. It's been voiced many times on these calls in the past. What I would say is, I can't believe that your Board doesn't think this company is worth substantially more than book value and you're currently trading at or under book with a substantial 20% of that being cash here or overseas? And so I know what I'd be saying if I sat on your Board, I'd be arguing that this company is worth a lot more than book, and you should be quite comfortable buying it back at under and even around book. So that's coming from, I think, from a long-term shareholder, but someone who really would love to see you guys start to actually become a little more proactive. Don't be so afraid of a tiny little level of debt. So I support the earlier comment that even going into your revolver to buy back $4 million or $5 million worth of stock would be, I think, greatly appreciated by the market and would be reflected in the share price.

Operator

And our last question for today will come from the line of [ Brett Davidson ] as a private investor now.

Unknown Attendee

I realize Greg has dropped off the line, but I'm hoping somebody can provide some level of update on the electric locomotive product lines and the manufactured diamond product lines.

Wendy Diddell
Executive VP, COO & Director

All right. I'll start with that. So let's take the latter one first on the diamond. What we've seen there in that market, and I think again, everybody has read about is that, that market became very quickly saturated, oversaturated the synthetic diamond market. And as a result of that, we've seen a slowdown in the demand for those magnetrons that are used in the equipment that manufactures the diamond. When Greg referred earlier to some of the other elements of Green Energy Solution being down, that's one of them. So in that area, it's still out there. We're still selling them. It's just again, an overcapacity of equipment already on the market and certainly an overcapacity of the synthetic diamonds.

All right, in terms of the EV rail market, I think Progress Rail recently put out some of its own press that they have recently shipped 2 of the large trains to Australia. So we're pleased to see that. You may recall in FY '23, we shipped a significant amount of batteries that are used in those trains. So we're going to sit back on the sidelines and see how those 2 trains perform in Australia and what that means for the future.

On a more steady cadence basis, as I just referred to in my answer to Ross Taylor, is that we are now shipping on a regular run rate, the starter modules, and we expect to see some upside there. So in general, I would say that the EV rail market certainly is favoring more of a hybrid approach. This is outside of Richardson. This is the general market. More of a hybrid approach, but our starter modules, they are used in any train, whether it's diesel, electric or hybrid. So we remain optimistic about growth in that segment of the business as well.

Operator

Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ed Richardson for closing remarks.

Edward Richardson
Chairman, CEO & President

Thanks, Victor. Well, thanks again for joining us today and for your questions during Q&A. We look forward to discussing our performance with you in April. And until then, please don't hesitate to call us at any time. Thank you very much.

Operator

Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.
