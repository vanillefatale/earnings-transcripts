[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird.

Colin Sebastian
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I guess, I mean, on the RCS performance, I mean, that's really, really strong. And I'm curious if there are any common denominators across NBA mobile other titles where you're seeing that strength. Anything specific you've learned from that, that maybe you can apply to other franchises going forward? And then considering the change in release date for GTA, just curious, does that change the cadence of content updates or marketing support for the existing franchise for GTA Online over the next year as we -- as you work to maintain engagement in the meantime?

Strauss Zelnick
Executive Chairman & CEO

So on the second question first, I don't think you'll see any change. And Rockstar has a history of supporting GTA Online, and of course, the title continues to perform incredibly well. I also know that GTA+ was up 20% year-over-year in the quarter, which is just great news. So -- and Grand Theft Auto V has now sold in 220 million units. It's a pretty great story. We expect that story to continue in a similar way. In terms of your first question, I think, are you asking whether we think there are sort of industry tailwinds that are driving recurrent consumer spending across the board?

Colin Sebastian
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Well, actually, it could be that or more specific to the way that you're developing games. Is there something within RCS, within the mechanics that you're seeing is resonating with gamers in particular, or maybe they're just specific to those titles.

Strauss Zelnick
Executive Chairman & CEO

So my sense is that despite what some industry observers are saying that there are modest tailwinds in the business. I think we're seeing those. And equally, look, our approach here is to seek perfection in everything we do and to try to engage and captivate our consumers. And when we do that, effectively monetization follows. And so I -- none of us is in the business of taking victory laps, even though we're very proud of the quarter. But I think the answer to your question is that our creative teams are delivering and they're delivering at the highest possible level.

And so when I see commentary in the industry that's negative about what's going on, I think if you try to correlate quality with performance, you're going to find it's an exceedingly positive correlation. And actually, I think you can find causation in there as well. Give people something great, they're going to come out for it.

Your next question comes from Doug Creutz with TD Cowen.

Douglas Creutz
TD Cowen, Research Division

It appears that you're soon going to be the last publicly traded stand-alone publisher of scale standing. I wondered your view on how that affects your ability to attract talent, your ability to place games in the market. Just sort of, is there anything about that strategically that affects your competitive position?

Strauss Zelnick
Executive Chairman & CEO

I think the answer is, I'm not sure. We're always running scared around here. I'm fond of saying arrogance is the enemy of continued success. And I do think we're in a terrific position. We're performing much better than expected economically and that's because we're performing better than expected creatively, and that's always our story around here. And if we can maintain that, then we have a wonderful future ahead of us. It is true that at year-end we're really very underleveraged.

It is true that in relatively short order we expect to be a net cash company again. And it's true that we're independent and we have a publicly traded security. And I think all of those things can be advantages in the right hands. But none of that will lead us to claim success before we deliver it. And whenever we have good results, our approach round here is to take no victory lap. It's to get up the next day and try to do it again. So that's what we'll keep doing. We do think we're well positioned.

Your next question comes from Chris Schoell with UBS.

Christopher Schoell
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

We saw one of your peers see outperformance on mobile margins due to the recent iOS changes. Can you just walk us through how widely available alternate payment mechanisms are across your portfolio today? And did that provide any uplift to gross margins in the quarter or your expectations for the year? And maybe just along these lines, any thoughts on the recently proposed changes to Google Play and what it means for your business?

Strauss Zelnick
Executive Chairman & CEO

Look, I've been saying for years that I expected the cost of third-party distribution to decline. And as soon as we closed the Zynga transaction, we launched a direct-to-consumer initiative that has been successful. We value our partnerships with retailers. We don't have any reason to believe that those will ever become extinct. At the same time, distribution costs naturally will decline with competition and in certain instances with litigation and legislation. And you're seeing that now. So our direct-to-consumer business is doing really well.

It has been rolled out almost across our entire mobile portfolio, not the entire portfolio because it doesn't necessarily fit everywhere. And the most recent litigation result definitely puts us in a stronger position. And not only will net bookings rise more rapidly than expected, but margins too will rise with them. So it's all good news. We're not specifically calling out how that margin change will affect our year, except obviously we've increased our guidance for the year.

Christopher Schoell
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Got it. And if I can just fit in one more, maybe just on the new GTA time line, anything you can share as to what the drivers were and what gives you confidence that the state will stick.

Strauss Zelnick
Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes, the drivers are a desire to deliver as perfect an entertainment experience as we possibly can and to try to live up to consumers extraordinary expectations and then exceed those expectations. And it's always painful when we move a date. We have done so occasionally in the past and we've never regretted it in retrospect. I would like to point out that we have some competitors in the event where more polish was required and it required slipping a date, they chose not to slip the date, and they did so at their peril.

Your next question comes from Andrew Marok with Raymond James.

Andrew Marok
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Maybe one on NBA and one on Borderlands. As it relates to NBA, we saw some of the metrics that you disclosed today were not well above -- they were well above what you would normally consider for kind of a mature sports franchise. So I guess where are you getting these incremental audiences from? Are there new cohorts of players that you're expanding into? And I guess what inning would you say that you're in, in terms of accessing the total NBA audience? And then I'll follow up with the Borderlands question.

Karl Slatoff
President

So in terms of the cohorts that we're seeing, obviously returning players are a huge cohort for us. And I would say we're -- every year, we're getting a little better at bringing people back into the games. And -- but there's still a lot of opportunity to improve on that. So you asked about what -- where inning we are, we are certainly not getting 100% of our people back every single year.

If we were to be able to do that, we would have substantial, substantial upside. And I'm not saying that we will be able to do that, but there is certainly a lot of room for improvement there. In terms of other players, we're having some success internationally as well, but also getting more engagement of the player base that we have. That's been a significant part of our ability to drive recurring consumer spending in NBA, which has had significant improvements year-over-year.

We're doing more interesting things like bringing people in earlier for early access with preorder premiums and just making the game tighter and listening to our audience base. And like we always say, higher the engagement, the more engagement, the monetization follows. It's not the other way around. And that's been our mantra pretty much from day one. So I'd love to say we're in the first inning, that's probably not true, but we're certainly not even to the seventh inning stretch at this point. So it's probably somewhere in between.

Andrew Marok
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Got it. Really appreciate that. And then on Borderlands, in these kind of longer-lived titles, how important is the launch period? And I guess to the extent that the PC issues caused a little bit of a drag, how does player behavior change in one of those titles versus maybe an annual release where maybe you don't have as much time to sort of make up anything that fell short of expectations around the launch period?

Strauss Zelnick
Executive Chairman & CEO

Well, we see it -- I mean, your question implies that we see this the same way. The release was a bit softer than we would have liked for the reasons that you said. Gearbox has been addressing the PC challenges, and I think in retrospect we feel that there are things that we could have done better, that we intend to do better in the future. In the fullness of time, we think the unit sales on this title will be very solid and the economic results will be in line with our expectations.

Your next question comes from Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley.

Matthew Cost
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I wanted to ask a little bit about mobile and Zynga. Obviously, it's been a stretch here of really strong outperformance for that business versus the broader mobile gaming market. So 2-parter. One, what is your level of confidence in their ability to sustain that continued outperformance of the market versus the market? Do you see that as a function of new game launches, growing existing titles? And then connected to that, is there an opportunity to do M&A in the mobile gaming space something that as an independent company, Zynga I think had a lot of success with? Is that something you're considering doing more of to build on the momentum Zynga has today?

Strauss Zelnick
Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean, what do I attribute their outperformance to? Great leadership, great execution. So Frank Gibeau is our -- is the CEO of Zynga. He's doing a terrific job leading the team and our creative teams, Peak, Rollic, all of our studios, frankly, right now are doing a wonderful job both running live services on existing titles and launching new titles. So we just have to keep doing more of that. What gives me confidence that we can. I think our approach has been narrowed and honed down at the label where we're being very careful economically.

We're pursuing far fewer titles at once. We're willing to walk away from titles that don't work earlier and focus on our winners. I also think our creative teams have really hit their stride. That said, we take none of this for granted and we know that, looking backward is not going to help us except to learn from our errors and to a lesser extent, our successes.

We have to look forward and we have some great releases coming up, so we're focused on those. So we have Top Goal coming from Nordeus and other titles coming about, which I'm very optimistic, but the fact that I'm optimistic is irrelevant. What's relevant is what the consumer says. On the M&A side, we're very selective here. We're very proud of the fact that I don't think we have had an acquisition in our history that didn't work out.

And that's an enviable and unusual track record for any corporation, any public company. We'd like that to continue. How do we do that? Well, make sure something is strategically aligned. Of course, don't step outside of that zone. Make sure that the cultures fit or can fit so that the integrations make sense. And make sure that the deal is immediately accretive, if not to GAAP earnings, at least to management and cash flow. So that has been our rubric and seems to have worked. So I guess what that implies is discipline and selectivity, which has served us well. Good news is we have a really strong balance sheet, and we have been able to do acquisitions in the relatively recent past. It wasn't that long ago that we bought Gearbox.

Your next question comes from Eric Handler with ROTH Capital Partners.

Eric Handler
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

Strauss, you've been very vocal on AI and how it's not a positive for creative development for video games. But I'm curious if you're having any success implementing AI in other sort of noncreative parts of the video game development, be it QC, be it artwork or whatever and how you're adding it to what, your development?

Strauss Zelnick
Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes. To be clear, I didn't say that I didn't see it as a positive. What I said was AI is based on backward-looking data sets meeting compute, meeting LLMs. And none of that replaces forward-looking genius. That's not an opinion, that's factual. I defy anyone to controvert those facts.

Of course, technology drives a lot of what we do around here. Now creativity is the lifeblood of the organization. But how do we express our creativity? We do so with computers, with technical tools, we always have. So as tool sets improve, we can become more efficient, we can become more effective. And our creative people, therefore, freed up to be more creative. So AI, depending on how you define it and properly deployed, of course, is positive for creativity.

And therefore, is, of course, positive for hit creation. To your question about what's the nature of the rollout, we have seen some efficiencies. I think there are plenty of areas of business where the tools that we have rolled out at the enterprise are helping us. We are not either using this as an excuse or frankly seeing the opportunity to reduce headcount. We are seeing this as an opportunity to take our very talented people and release them from more mundane tasks so they can do more creative and more interesting tasks, and we can work better as an organization. But if you said, can you cut your cost profile by 5% tomorrow using all things AI, the answer is no.

Your next question comes from Ed Alter with Jefferies.

Edward Alter
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Appreciate the mention of the pipeline and specifically BioShock. You guys made a pretty key hire there with Rod Fergusson during the quarter. Would love to just get an update on that title and kind of what his mandate is at the studio.

Karl Slatoff
President

Sure, and we're very excited that we brought Rod on to lead Cloud Chamber, and he is the new Head of the BioShock franchise. He's obviously an incredible industry veteran. He's got history with the BioShock franchise, specifically with Infinite. But he's also been involved with Gears of War and Diablo, and it's -- we're just so grateful that he's come to work with us at Cloud Chamber.

BioShock is a very important franchise for us. It's one of our big -- 2K's biggest franchises and we're very excited about the release of the next BioShock. We've made some changes in the organization. We're shifting some things around. But right now, we feel that the game is on a great track for us to deliver something that's going to exceed consumers expectations. So not much more to update other than that and the fact that the next BioShock is going to take the franchise to the next level, which is always our ambition with all of our franchises.

And then on ad revenue, it's been up 2 quarters and now for the first time in quite a while. Can you talk about what's going right there? Is that Color Block Jam or is there a broader Rollic portfolio just performing across the board?

Lainie Goldstein
Chief Financial Officer

It's really across the entire mobile business, particularly Rollic though, they've achieved fantastic performance, and this is what's driving the higher ad revenue for the quarter.

Your next question comes from Michael Hickey with Benchmark.

Michael Hickey
The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division

Strauss, Karl, Lainie, Nicole, congrats, guys, on the quarter and raising your numbers for the year. Obviously, sorry to hear the delay of GTA VI, but November next year, Strauss, is going to be pretty awesome. Just curious, I guess, internally, how the Rockstar team is holding up with the delays. I'm guessing it could be challenges on motivation or culture, I don't know, but I'm guessing it's hard on them to have to deal with the delay as well.

I'm sure they're very excited to get the game out. And then in terms of polish, I mean, I think I know what that means, but just sort of curious what Rockstar defines as polish. And then how much of -- they have a huge team now, so how much of the team, Strauss, as much as you can tell us, is focused on polish versus maybe other content, ideas or projects that could be part of that GTA ecosystem or otherwise?

Strauss Zelnick
Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes. Obviously, Mike, you know us well, you know me well. I can't talk about how the inner workings of the studio are reflected in current activities. So I can't -- I wouldn't answer that question. On the first point, I think the culture of Rockstar is extraordinary and we're all pushing hard to seek perfection. And that's not just words. I mean the Metacritic scores of Rockstar releases are, generally speaking, not -- I mean, with very few exceptions, have been over 95.

And GTA V, as you know, has been the standard-bearer, not just for our company, but for the industry through 3 console generations. And to this day is still, I would argue, the most technologically advanced title in the marketplace, despite the fact that it's more than a decade old. And that doesn't happen by accident. So it's -- Rockstar's culture is one of performance. Take-Two's culture as a whole, which is reflected in all of our labels, is one of seeking excellence, teamwork and kindness. And that's a recipe that works really, really well.

I can't deny that at any given time, if things don't go exactly as you'd like, there's some disappointment. But we're pretty good about brushing ourselves off and picking ourselves up and playing another day. And we've always done that. We learn from things that don't go as well as we'd like, and we aim to exceed all expectations, our own and those of our consumers. And we, frankly, rarely fall short, but we don't let that divert us either because we just tried harder. I think that defines what Rockstar is doing now and how they're feeling now.

Your next question comes from Martin Yang with Oppenheimer.

Martin Yang
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Can you talk about the premium SKU mix in NBA this year? How much is it higher than previous years? And then can you also talk about the impact of having more season passes embedded in the premium SKU, whether or not that's a material uplift to your RCS growth for 2K26?

Karl Slatoff
President

So one of the drivers -- so generally speaking, the more -- the higher the mix of the premium SKUs, obviously the average selling price is higher. That is certainly the case this time around and we've seen some really great reactions to our premium SKUs. And we believe, at least partly, if not in large part was the effect of offering 7 days of early access to our players, which is longer than we did last time. And there is some RCS embedded in that as part of that package. So it would have a really significant impact, and I think that's overall helped our average selling price. So it was certainly a successful strategy that we undertook this year.

Your next question comes from Alec Brondolo with Wells Fargo.

Alec Brondolo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I actually want to go back to the first question that was asked and maybe actually ask about macro in the mobile game or in the game category in general. I think people consider this a mature category, maybe low single-digit grower. But suddenly, Take-Two RCS is up 20%. We have mobile game ad networks growing well in excess of 20%. Roblox seems to be growing bookings 50% or 60%. And so from your guys perspective is it possible or you may be starting to feel like we're entering a more positive cycle for industry growth. And to the extent that's true, perhaps you might opine on what the consumer behavior behind that is.

Strauss Zelnick
Executive Chairman & CEO

I do sense there are tailwinds as much as I would love to take credit for everything good that's going on and disclaim responsibility for anything bad going on. No, I sort of agree with you. I think it feels like there is -- the consumers are once again moving in our direction, sort of how it felt at the beginning of the pandemic, maybe not quite as much enthusiasm. And we're unaccustomed to the world feeling this way because, of course, there was a decline in mid-'22 and took a while to settle out and then there was a return to modest growth. But as you yourself said, these are pockets of growth. These pockets are defined by quality. And so we have to still be an outlier to deliver results like these, and that's our goal.

Your final question comes from Clay Griffin with MoffettNathanson.

Clayton Griffin
MoffettNathanson LLC

I just want to circle back on mobile. Strauss, you hit all of the points in terms of the margin improvement in the near term, but also over the course of the last several fiscal years. It looks like rough math that the mobile business in general will be pretty close to where it was, call it, on a pro forma basis, call it, in '22.

I just would love to ask you if maybe you could just level set in terms of all of the -- whether it's the discipline in the titles, whether it's the efficiency in the UA spend, whatever. It does seem like there's been a pretty notable expansion in margins from then to now, notwithstanding the opportunities that you called out. But wondering if you could maybe just give us a framework in terms of the overall improvement maybe in mobile margins from, call it, 2, 3 years ago to now.

Strauss Zelnick
Executive Chairman & CEO

Look, honestly, we're just executing better. There were things that we were doing upon the acquisition that we've either stopped doing or we're doing a whole lot more efficiently and effectively. And one of the reasons that, that transaction came about is that we had like-minded cultures.

And I think we aligned on the culture I described earlier, and we aligned on our pillars of creativity, innovation and efficiency. And we have an extraordinary leadership team that is open-minded and wants to win. And then we have amazing, creative people throughout the organization who are bound and determined to do the very best work anyone can in the space. I think that's what it comes down to. And all of that done right is reflected in things like net bookings and margins.

When you think about all these calls, we've been doing for all this time, we talk about the numbers quite correctly, I think, as a result of what we do, not a driver of what we do. None of us wakes up in the morning and says, let's talk about where our stock price ought to go. We talk about where our company ought to go. And if we get that right, stock price is going to do just fine. I think, and Nicole, our Head of IR, is sitting with me, that in the 18 years that this management team has been responsible for overseeing Take-Two, our stock has appreciated something close to 5,000%. And that's a result of our strategy.

That is not our strategy. And what we aim to do around here is make the best entertainment on earth and bring it to everyone on earth wherever they want it, whenever they want it, however they want it. If we do that right, if we keep doing that right, if we're willing to question ourselves and always try harder and try again when we fall short, probably ought to see continued performance.

Operator

There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back over to Strauss for any closing remarks.

Strauss Zelnick
Executive Chairman & CEO

I'd just like to take a moment once again to express my gratitude for the nearly 13,000 people who devote their careers to Take-Two and all of our affiliates all over the world because they're the ones who delivered these amazing results. I want to thank the team at Rockstar who's diligently working on delivering the best entertainment experience of all time. And of course, I want to thank our shareholders for all of their support. So thank you for attending the call today. We really appreciate it.
