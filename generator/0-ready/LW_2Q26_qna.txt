Question-and-Answer Session


Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Tom Palmer with JPMorgan.


Thomas Palmer
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

You made a comment in the prepared remarks about rebalancing supply and demand. It sounded like a temporary pullback in production is anticipated in Europe. In the U.S. last year, there was a plant closure and lines curtailed. I'm just wondering, should we start thinking about similar actions in Europe coming into play, so something more substantial than maybe reducing shifts? Or are there other actions that can be taken to kind of aid this rebalance?


Mike Smith
President, CEO & Director

Tom, I'll take the first part of that and then let Bernadette comment further. As we said, we've restarted some of those curtailed lines that we have previously curtailed in North America driven by the strong volume. We have also communicated to our employees that we are curtailing a single line in our European market as well. So we are looking across our global supply chain and making sure that we're taking the right approaches to balance that supply and demand globally.


Thomas Palmer
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then just as we think about -- I understood the commentary, I guess, in Europe on some of the pressures, but I did want to maybe focus on North America a bit. As we think about some of the, I guess, volume drivers in the back half and some of the less investment in price relative to the first half, should we start to see in 3Q, for instance, more of a seasonal uptick in North America? Or are there items maybe there to consider?


Bernadette Madarieta
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So thanks, Tom. As it relates to North America, a big piece that we need to consider is that it's not only price, but it's a large component of this is mix. In North America, we are seeing a higher proportion of our business with multinational chain customers as well as we are seeing in our retail channel, a shift from branded to more private label. And so that is the -- what we would expect to continue in the back half of the year, which will affect gross margins as we move forward and is also contributing to what we shared in our prepared remarks of the 20.4% or relatively flat gross margins in the back half of the year relative to the first half.


Operator

And the next question will come from Peter Galbo with Bank of America.


Peter Galbo
BofA Securities, Research Division

Mike, I maybe wanted to actually pick up on the international side. I believe in your prepared remarks, you kind of walked through the dynamics in Europe and Latin America. I didn't hear and maybe I missed it, but I didn't hear any commentary on Asia and in particular, some of the Asia export markets. I think there's been a fair amount of trade press just around local competitors in the region, not only getting more competitive in home markets, but in some of your export markets throughout Asia. So I would just love to have an update from you there on kind of what you're seeing real time and whether or not that competition has intensified since we spoke like 3 months ago.


Mike Smith
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Let me -- thanks, Peter. Let me speak to a few of those markets that you suggested. As Bernadette talked about some of the mix shifts in our international markets, some of that is driven by strength that we are seeing in China as well as APAC. When you look at Europe, there's been a really strong crop, and it's resulted in lower cost raw. And that's on the backdrop of more depressed kind of traffic in those markets.

When you look around the globe, there has been some added capacity in some of those developing markets, like you said, and that is putting more pressure on exports out of Europe into some of those markets, which has challenged the price there a little bit. But overall, we believe in the future of the international market. We believe that as we support our customers in those markets, we'll continue to drive growth. Argentina and Latin America is another strong area that has high growth rates. And we believe that having that asset down in that market will set us up for future success.


Peter Galbo
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. And Bernadette, I mean, I think the flat to down commentary on the second half gross margin, does that hold for both quarters as well? If I look back at Lamb Weston, the history of Lamb Weston as a public company, like third quarter gross margins have been down versus the second quarter like twice than it was during COVID. So I don't even know if we count that. So just want to understand if that comment is very much a second half comment or if it also applies to the third quarter.


Bernadette Madarieta
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks, Peter. The comment that I made in my prepared remarks was definitely for the second half of the year and then that being primarily driven by mix shifts and pricing headwinds as well as the ramp-up that we have in Argentina. So while the normal seasonality is still underlying the business, in the second half, we're going to see some moderation on those typical seasonal trends, particularly flattening the third quarter seasonal increase in gross margins. And then we would expect the fourth quarter to step down from there.


Operator

And the next question will come from Matt Smith with Stifel.


Matthew Smith
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Bernadette, the outlook calls for moderating price/mix drag in the second half in North America. A couple of follow-up questions there. In terms of pricing on this year's contracts, is that landing in line with the performance relative to last year? And if I go back to the initial guidance, price/mix was expected to moderate to kind of a low single-digit headwind in North America. Is that still the right way to think about it? Or has the mix impact caused that moderation to maybe lessen a bit?


Bernadette Madarieta
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks, Matt. So first, I just want to start off with the strong momentum that we've had in the first half of the year. And North America being our most profitable segment is strong. We expected price/mix to be down more in the first half of the year than the second, and we still expect that trend. And as you mentioned, it's just very important to note that the combination of both price and mix is what's affecting our North America segment. And that mix impact has been more pronounced recently with the growth in more chain business as well as that mix shift from branded products to private label.


Matthew Smith
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

And so when we think about that mix headwind, should we -- is that a drag on performance through really this time next year, just given how the balance of the business has been performing?


Bernadette Madarieta
Chief Financial Officer

We'll need to continue to monitor that. Certainly, as it relates to our chain customers that would continue. We'll continue to monitor whether the trend from branded to private label persists, but we would expect that to persist throughout the balance of this year.


Operator

And our next question will come from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen.


Robert Moskow
TD Cowen, Research Division

I wanted to dig into the decision to open -- reopen more of your capacity in North America. The wording was a little confusing in the prepared remarks. You said you did it because you -- because facilities are returning to more optimal levels versus the very high utilization rates recently experienced. So are you saying that utilization rates got too high in first quarter, you need to reopen more of your production lines in order to get them lower? And is there any kind of negative impact to your profitability as a result of that or not? And then secondly, how long do you think this will persist? Is this a permanent decision or not?


Mike Smith
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Rob, I appreciate the question. We've been focused on driving customer partnerships over the last several months. When you think about where we spend our time, it's around the customer and around driving out costs. And because of that, you are seeing the results of that hard work, volume up 8% in the quarter.

As you said, yes, utilization rates in our North American facilities were in the low 90s as we grew that volume over the first half of the year, they got to a level where we needed to open up this additional capacity to ensure that we continue to meet our customers' expectations regarding fill rates. The plants are running really well. As you have those lines start to run more frequently, you start to see better run rates, better OEEs, better potato utilization, which is all positive. So we don't expect a drag from a cost basis from turning those lines back on.


Bernadette Madarieta
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, Rob. And if I could just add, the second comment or question that you had was related to the impact on margins. And in the first half, if you think about the results, we had higher fixed factory burden driven by North America in Q1. And then as we've restarted those lines in North America, we've seen that lessen, but more in international in Q2. In the back half of the year, we would expect there to be a net positive from a factory burden perspective, led by North America as that absorption improves with restarting those lines. But international is going to remain a headwind with Latin America and Europe continuing to carry incremental costs.


Robert Moskow
TD Cowen, Research Division

Got it. And in terms of like keeping these lines open, it's for the foreseeable future. There's -- it's not a temporary measure.


Mike Smith
President, CEO & Director

Yes. As we said in the prepared remarks, I think as I look at the full year, North America is in a solid position, and we're seeing more predictability. And so we plan on having these lines open as we continue to demonstrate our strength with our customers and the volume here in the North American market.


Operator

And the next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein.


Alexia Howard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Can I ask how you're managing to improve execution through increased discipline, more accountability and metrics. I know you talked about how, when capacity utilization was very high in the last few years, it was very hard to get your arms around all of that. Obviously, you've taken a little bit of a pause on capacity utilization. It's now ramping up again. But what can you manage and monitor now that you maybe couldn't do a couple of years ago? And how is that helping your ability to execute and keep everything flowing smoothly?


Mike Smith
President, CEO & Director

Yes, I appreciate it, Alexia. There's a few things that are going on. One, as we've had started our Focus to Win work and really focused on the executional excellence part in our cost savings program, we've put clear accountabilities in place across our supply chain. We are now measuring ourselves and certain KPIs in a number of different areas and really focused on delivering those at the plant level. We've had AlixPartners who participated in some of the work with us, have helped us put together the right scorecarding and the right tracking in place, and we look at that on a regular basis. We're also investing in additional support in our demand and supply planning to make sure that we execute on a better basis or a more accurate basis moving forward that reduces or adds, I should say, better predictability in the business moving forward.


Operator

And the next question will come from Max Gumport with BNP.


Max Andrew Gumport
BNP Paribas, Research Division

Halfway through the year, half of the year left. I'm curious what scenarios you're seeing that could still push you to the lower half of your adjusted EBITDA guidance? And asked differently, what prevents you today from raising the low end of the range?


Mike Smith
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Max, as I think about it, we're working really hard to deliver the commitments and the expectations that we've made. I think as you look at our overall business, we've delivered strong volume momentum. We've made meaningful changes to how we operate, both in our cost structure, but also in our operations overall, which we've talked about. I think restarting those curtailed lines in North America is a great sign and that volume that we're seeing come through. So we're really proud of the accomplishments that we've made in such a short amount of time.

That said, turnarounds are not linear, like I said in the prepared remarks, and we're navigating an ongoing competitive environment. We're seeing continued soft traffic. There's continued macroeconomic headwinds like everyone is facing. But I'll tell you, as I look at it for the full year, I think North America is in a really solid position, and we're seeing more predictability, as I said earlier.

When I think about those international markets, they remain a bit more dynamic. We got to manage through that the right way. And you've heard us say this already. There was a lot -- a good crop in Europe, which has led to lower costs in that market. There remains a soft demand around traffic in those markets. And then as capacity has been built in some of those regions around the globe, there's less exports from Europe, which is creating some of the pressure in that market. That's really where we're seeing the challenge in the future.


Bernadette Madarieta
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And Max, just to confirm, in the prepared remarks, we did say that we're expecting to be near the midpoint of that EBITDA range. And again, the factors being price/mix headwinds as well as start-up and ramp-up costs in Argentina, along with additional fixed factory burden from underutilization of the manufacturing capacity in Europe as we work to rebalance supply and demand.


Max Andrew Gumport
BNP Paribas, Research Division

Great. And as a follow-up, I think, obviously, the shares are down meaningfully today. And I think part of what's being reflected there is investor concern around if Lamb Weston is not able to raise the low end of the guidance today on EBITDA, what does that mean for '27, where that lower half of the range is more likely in the remainder of '26. And what does that imply for '27? Does it imply further EBITDA declines next year as well? Is there any commentary you can offer to push back against that just given how the shares are performing right now?


Mike Smith
President, CEO & Director

Yes, here's what I'd say. Listen, we're working hard to deliver on our commitments and expectations. And I think we're taking prudence in our guidance to make sure that we deliver going forward. I'd say we're still early in the innings in our Focus to Win plan. We just rolled it out 5 months ago, and the traffic environment remains a bit challenged. But we believe in our strategy. We've had some great improvements around our business, especially in costs and also building those customer partnerships.

A key element of improving our margin over the long term is going to be unlocking additional cost savings. We're well on our way this year. We believe we have the right plan in place to continue to do that in the future. But we'll provide more details on what we think those margin targets will be once we're a little bit further along in our Focus to Win process.


Bernadette Madarieta
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And just to add, as Mike has said in the prepared remarks, North America is our most profitable segment, and it's in a solid position. There are some price/mix headwinds in the back half of the year, and there are some incremental costs related to ramp-up but under utilization, and we've already provided an example of actions that we are taking to manage those costs. So for now, we expect to be closer to the midpoint, but very important to keep in mind that our most profitable segment, the North America segment is very strong right now. And in international, we're working through those dynamics.


Operator

[Operator Instructions] We'll go ahead and take our next question from Scott Marks with Jefferies.


Scott Marks
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I wanted to ask a little bit about the price/mix dynamic in North America, specifically, you highlighted the mix impact of that headwind. As it relates to the other side of it, kind of the trade support component, wondering maybe how you're thinking about that in terms of where your support is right now for customers and whether or not you believe there's some incremental support warranted going forward? Or are you comfortable with where levels are right now?


Mike Smith
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I appreciate the question. Listen, we're really focused on driving those customer partnerships and driving the volume. You saw that in the first half of the year. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, about 90% of those large chain contracts have been settled. We'll have the rest of our contracts will get settled here over the next couple of weeks, and we feel good about where things are at. As we've gone through that RFP and contracting time period, there have been some customers where we have needed to defend some of the pricing to make sure that we succeed with those customers long term and keep those customers. And those are customers who are driving growth and having success in the marketplace.

But as you said, I mean, the thing that I want to make sure is clear is that not all of this is price related. There is a mix component of which Bernadette talked about. And a piece of that is mix between customers within the restaurants, also mix with some of those faster-growing QSRs and also some mix in our retail side of the business as we're seeing a shift from branded to private label. But the predictability of our North America business is much better than it has been in the past.


Bernadette Madarieta
Chief Financial Officer

And just to make sure that in the prepared remarks, you did catch that we do expect in the second half for the price/mix headwinds to moderate slightly as we lap the fiscal '25 pricing actions. So that's important to keep in mind as we look to the back half of the year.


Scott Marks
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Understood. Second question for me, maybe on prior calls, I think you had noted a significant amount of capacity in international markets or plans for international capacity that had been paused previously. But it sounds like today, you're talking about there has been actually some added capacity. So wondering if you can just help us kind of square the 2 in terms of what happened with those projects that were previously paused.


Mike Smith
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Listen, the pace of newly announced capacity has definitely slowed. I think what we've been speaking to is some of the capacity that has been added over the course of the last year or so in some of those developing markets. But we believe that the industry is going to be rational over time. I probably was starting to sound a little bit like a broken record. And we'll continue to manage our supply chain footprint as we have in the past. We believe that when traffic returns, we're going to be well positioned to benefit from that growth. But again, we have heard and continue to hear of postponements or delays or even cancellations in this market and believe that the environment will be rational.


Operator

And the next question will come from Marc Torrente with Wells Fargo Securities.


Marc Torrente
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

First, you called out visibility to volume growth in the back half with North America at or above the front half. Just want to get a sense of how much of that is driven by the 53rd week and how the underlying momentum is against tougher laps? And I guess, what that could look like entering fiscal '27?


Bernadette Madarieta
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So as it relates to our volume outlook, what we're expecting to see in the second half is that it will be relatively consistent other than the 53rd week. Again, that is based on the pace of increase in volumes that we've had with some of our chain customers in the first half of the year. As it relates to international, we expect it to be flat in the second half of the year compared with the prior year as we continue to navigate those dynamic markets.


Mike Smith
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And I've already shared a little bit about where -- at the right time, we'll come back and talk about where we believe margin will be in the future, but we believe that our Focus to Win plan has us on track and to deliver growth. Consumption, if you look at it, is expected to be between 2% and 4% and over the next, call it, 5 years or so. And you're going to see that higher in emerging markets and lower in some of the more established markets.

But I think as we've demonstrated in the first half of the year, we're implementing a strategy that positions us to gain share and really lean into some of those premium segments of the market. So we're really confident in our ability to grow volume with our customers even in a challenged environment or a challenged traffic environment that we're seeing today.


Marc Torrente
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then yes, on the traffic front, continues to be soft. Are you seeing anything in November, December that suggests any improvement or deterioration? And what are your expectations for trends over, say, the next 12 months?


Mike Smith
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think we just saw the November data last night. I think it's very consistent to what Bernadette shared in the prepared remarks. So nothing different from that.


Operator

And the next question will come from Carla Casella with JPMorgan.


Carla Casella
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I was just wondering if you could give us a little more color in terms of where you think overall industry capacity for frozen stands and if it varies dramatically by country or region.


Mike Smith
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I shared a little bit of that earlier. Like I said, we believe that the market is going to be rational over time. I probably sound like a broken record. I've said that in several calls over the last couple of quarters. But we have heard of delays and postponements. We have seen some capacity built in some of those developing markets, which is having an impact on exports out of Europe, especially given the low cost of raw. But again, there's been some consolidation in the market, and we'll continue to see how that potentially impacts the future. But we believe that this industry is going to be rational and has been. We'll manage through it the right way as we are and as you've seen in the first half of the year.


Carla Casella
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And sorry I missed part of the early part.


Operator

And the next question will come from William Reuter with Bank of America.


William Reuter
BofA Securities, Research Division

You've made some comments today about focusing on execution, working with your partners. It sounds like in some instances, maybe you're paying penalties or having to accept pricing that is lower than would be fair based upon your prior missteps, maybe some of the ERP challenges. I guess, do you believe that this is the case? And do you believe that over time, as you continue to have high fill rates that you may be able to demand greater pricing from those customers?


Mike Smith
President, CEO & Director

Yes, I don't think that's the case at all. As we shared, we feel really good about where our North America business is at. In the current macroeconomic environment and with slower traffic or softer traffic, we're winning in the marketplace when it comes to volume. So our customers are turning to Lamb Weston because of that history of innovation, quality consistency and delivering on our service, and we're proving that. We spent a lot of time focused on our customers. And when you have the right focus, you see results. And that's what you're seeing in the marketplace right now and believe we'll continue to do that into the future.

As Bernadette mentioned, yes, price/mix was down in our North America business, but it's important to keep in mind that a large sizable portion of that is from mix, which is driven by some of those shifts from branded to private label and retail as well as some shifts between QSR customers or restaurant customers in the current traffic environment.


Bernadette Madarieta
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And to be clear, all pricing has been based on competitive market conditions.


William Reuter
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. That makes sense. And then with the stock down, you're still below your 3.5x leverage target. How is this going to inform decisions on capital allocation and potential acceleration of share repurchases?


Bernadette Madarieta
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So our capital allocation priorities remain consistent with what I shared in my prepared remarks. We're focused on spending capital where we need to spend to deliver our strategy and our business. We will always, as we have in the recent past, look at opportunistic share repurchases. Nothing will change there. But we're focused on delivering our capital allocation strategy, which includes investing in the business and returning cash to shareholders.


Operator

And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference back over to Debbie Hancock.
