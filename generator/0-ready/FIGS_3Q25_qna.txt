[Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Bob Drbul with BTIG.

Robert Drbul
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Nice quarter. A couple of questions for you. Just on the gross margin performance this quarter, I guess when you look at it a little bit longer term into next year, but I would even say when you look at your historical results, given your ability to sort of navigate a lot of the tariffs, can you just talk us through how you envision that segment, that line item of the business over the next several years, I guess, at this point?

Catherine Spear
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Bob, yes, so we saw a really great gross margin for this quarter, up to 69.9%. Obviously, that's been quite higher than where that rate has been. We did see some components there, some that will continue into the future, but some that are unique to the quarter. We are seeing improved discount rates from the pullback in our promo strategy, and we'll see that continue into Q4 as being a benefit year-over-year. Longer term, that increase year-over-year will moderate as that promo strategy normalizes into next year.

We've been working hard with our new returns partner and seen some good improvement in our refurbishment rates. Then there was a bit of nuance in how some returns processing happened with the prior year DC transition. We do expect some of those improvements in refurbishment rates to continue going forward, but not at the same rate that we saw in the quarter. We've been really working hard to optimize our inbound rates, and we saw the benefit of that this quarter, and that should continue into next year until we annualize that.

Obviously, tariffs are the biggest piece, and so that will have a 440 bps total impact next year or up 330 bps. There's still some unknowns around how tariffs will remain. We'll continue to monitor that, but feeling good with our measures of how we're able to continue to find efficiencies within margin and carry that into future to continue to work on offsetting those tariffs.

Next question is from the line of Rick Patel with Raymond James.

Rakesh Patel
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the strong execution. Can you expand on the demand that you saw during the business as usual days when you didn't offer promotions. How is Q3 performance on those days relative to where it was in the first half?

Second, given tariffs are intensifying and demand is holding up well, what do you need to see to revisit the pricing lever for next year?

Catherine Spear
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Great. In terms of our business as usual days, we've seen acceleration each quarter in those business as usual days. Really great to see that. It's really from the broad-based performance that we're seeing across both the U.S. and international as well as both scrubwear and non-scrubwear. Really happy with that performance, and it's really that acceleration that has had revenue growth rates overall accelerate each quarter. Really happy with what we're seeing there.

Then I think you asked on pricing, and so our pricing remains consistent with what we've shared previously. Several considerations that we've shared before that still remain, which is healthcare professionals need our products to do the critical work that they do. Nearly 2/3 of our customers make under $100,000 a year. We have 16 core styles that generate the majority of our revenue. Our ability to simply flow through higher prices into new seasons or new styles is limited.

We want to be prudent, and there is still some open-endedness on where tariffs will land. We've been working really hard on our tariff mitigation and these efforts include optimizing our supplier base, negotiating discounts with our suppliers and driving efficiency in inbound and outbound. The great news is that we've seen strong progress on these measures to-date. We're not going to be taking pricing in 2025. If we were to take any future pricing, that decision would be held to share with our healthcare professionals first so that we can control the narrative and deliver with the care that our healthcare professionals deserve.

Next question is from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs.

Brooke Roach
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Trina, Sarah, I was hoping we could discuss the trends that you're seeing in AOV, understood that some of this is coming from the promo reset, but how are you thinking about the opportunity for AOV to contribute to revenue growth as you look ahead into 2026?

Similarly, can you talk a little bit about the customer trends that you're seeing? Are your customers engaging more frequently? Are they staying for longer? Are you seeing better reactivation trends or better new acquisition trends? Are you seeing any trends specifically within any age or income cohorts given the broader macro environment?

Catherine Spear
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Great. I'll start with the question on AOV. In terms of AOV, we've been seeing that increase each quarter and saw a fairly large increase in the current quarter, up 6%. That is driven from both mix shift in our product as well as the pullback in our promotional efforts. I think as we think about 2026, we still think there is some opportunity for AOV to continue to increase. That's largely with how we're thinking about product mix and continuing to build out that full assortment head to toe of that healthcare professional and continue to drive into a higher wallet share that we know is available to us.

Sarah Oughtred
Chief Financial Officer

I'll just add in terms of the trends we're seeing in our consumer. Brooke, as you know, we don't -- we serve a different consumer than the average apparel or even e-commerce company. Our customer works in an industry that has a real like level of stability. People need healthcare workers. They're not going anywhere. If anything, our industry is really accelerating. It's the healthcare jobs are the fastest-growing job segment. They're growing 3x faster than the overall job market. The demand for healthcare professionals is expected to remain high.

A lot of the trends that we've seen in the quarter, some of it is the fundamentals of the industry and obviously, what we're doing on the product side, on the marketing side to execute at the level that you're seeing.

To your question around like the trends we're seeing, we're seeing our customers come back. If you look at repeat frequency and you kind of remove the impact of the promotional pullback, we're seeing repeat frequency up significantly. We're seeing our reactivations up significantly, and we're seeing actually cohorts performing across all income levels. Really great trends across the board. We feel really confident that the post-COVID overhang is easing, and we're operating in a much more normalized environment, and it's great to see.

Next question is from the line of Matt Koranda with ROTH Capital.

Matt Koranda
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

It's probably just a follow-up from some of the earlier questions. Just wanted to hear a little bit about what's driving the acceleration that you're implying into the fourth quarter despite the tougher comparison year-over-year. I just wanted to hear a little bit more about customer strength. It sounded just like Trina, like you just said, even your lower income cohort is still performing well. I just wanted to hear you kind of talk a little bit more about the drivers of the acceleration into the end of the year here.

Sarah Oughtred
Chief Financial Officer

Matt, yes. I mean, we've been seeing some really broad-based and healthy trends that have continued to progress as the year has gone on and see the opportunity for that to continue into Q4. We feel good with how our product and marketing is set up for the fourth quarter. We think we can get there with continuing the trends that we've seen.

We've been seeing that new customer acquisition has turned positive in terms of growth for the last 2 quarters and seeing that momentum also really come from our domestic business, which carries weight in terms of the overall growth. We're seeing some great trends in the business as usual days that has been accelerating. All of those components has been captured in how we're thinking about the fourth quarter upcoming.

From a promotional perspective, our stance has still remained with how we had seen before. The improvement in revenue growth expectations from Q4 really comes from our business as usual days. No change in how we've been thinking about promo. For Q4, the focus will be on Black Friday, Cyber Monday, but similar to previous quarters, there will be a pullback in our efforts versus the prior year.

Matt Koranda
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

Can I ask about community hubs? You guys sounded more excited, I guess, than usual about the opportunity to lean in there going into '26. Just wanted to hear a little bit more about the potential drivers of growth with Community Hub and where we are with store formats, how they're set up for growth next year.

Catherine Spear
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Sure. Thanks, Matt. We're really excited about our community hubs. We're about to more than double the amount that we have. We only have a community hub in Century City in Los Angeles today and in Philadelphia and Rittenhouse Square. We're about to open New York City on the Upper East side at 69th and 3rd. We're right in what's called hospital row, which is incredible. You have Memorial Sloan Kettering, you have the hospital Special Surgery, New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell, Rockefeller. These are powerhouse healthcare institutions that are literally at the same intersection of where we are.

Houston, we're opening right near Texas Medical Center, the world's largest medical complex. It has 120,000 employees, 10 million patient encounters a year, over 180,000 surgeries a year, and so Houston, incredible healthcare professional city, and it's a great place to be, and we're really excited.

Finally, Chicago. We're located less than 2 miles west of the loop. We're in Illinois Medical District. It's one of the largest urban medical district clusters in the United States, 4 major hospital systems, 2 medical university campuses, 40-plus healthcare-related facilities. That's just -- those are just opening the rest of 2025, and it's November 6 today. Couldn't be more excited.

We're taking our learnings from what we've seen with our first 2 hubs 40% of customers are still coming in new to the brand. 30% of customers that are coming into our community hubs are becoming omnichannel customers coming back into the stores, coming back to us online. Really strong -- and we're seeing really strong incrementality in the markets that we're in, and so took a lot of the learnings from our 2 hubs. We've redone the format, the space, how much inventory we can get on the floor, how we're approaching our color drop stories, our newness, our layering, our fit and how we can showcase that in a new and original way.

Finally, customization. Everyone wants their scrubs embroidered with their name and their logo so they can tell the world who they are and what they do. These are just being in person with our community, having them feel and touch and experience our product and our brand is -- it's so amazing and so important, and we're really excited.

Next question is from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.

Brian Nagel
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Nice quarter. Congratulations. I've got a couple of questions. I guess one near term and then one long term. On the near-term side, as we look at the sales acceleration in the business, particularly what's happened here in the third quarter, then as you're telegraphing in the fourth quarter, to what extent is that sales acceleration being driven by new products, the new product introductions?

Then my follow-up question, I guess, is longer term, a little bit longer term in nature, but now as we're watching the top line of FIGS start to solidify, you're seeing the sales growth. Is there any updated thinking on how the margin – particularly, the EBITDA margin profile of the business should evolve over time? Should we have the potential to get back to the peak operating margins?

Sarah Oughtred
Chief Financial Officer

Great. In terms of your question on is the growth coming from new products, I mean, actually, what we're really excited to see is the majority of the growth is coming from our core products and even in our core colors. That's a great foundation for the long-term health of our business. Obviously, we've seen growth in some of our newer styles and in our color, and it's really showing that when we showcase some of that newness and innovation, it actually drives the halo effect to our overall core. Really great for us to see there that we have the ability to continue that momentum longer term from a sales growth perspective.

In terms of EBITDA, for next year. For now, we've made the commitment that our adjusted EBITDA margin rate would be within range of our guide for 2025. We do have 330 bps of tariff headwind year-over-year into next year. We would be offsetting that in order to stay within range of this year. Our ability to meaningfully offset that is from improvements that we are making in the business to be more efficient, to drive into savings while still being able to invest for the longer term. We'll have some harder ability to expand margin next year just due to the tariffs. Longer term, we see the path for this foundation to continue to go forward and us for -- to drive growth, both top line and into bottom line.

Next question is from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Group.

Dana Telsey
Telsey Advisory Group LLC

Nice to see the progress, Trina. Two things. As you think about the Olympics coming up and the marketing for the Winter Olympics, what will be the same or different than what you did for the Olympics in Paris, knowing that summer, this is winter. What do you see as the difference? One of the interesting things in the quarter is the sequential improvement in the growth rate of the non-scrubs business, up high singles compared to the slight decline last quarter. What are you seeing there? What categories are resonating?

Catherine Spear
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Thank you so much, Dana. We're really excited about our continued partnership with Team USA. As you know, we're the first company ever to outfit a medical team for any country globally, and we're really proud to be able to do that again for these upcoming winter games in Milano Cortina. There's a few things that we really learned and we're going to be applying from our lessons in Paris.

First one is that we're finding more ways to have an impact. We learned a lot on the ground. We've created an even better, if you can imagine, a more dedicated space at the Team USA, welcome Experience. That's really exciting. We have a brand-new fabrication called FIBERx. It's really made for healthcare professionals in more high-impact environments like what you would be doing outside in winter and especially for the medical professionals supporting our athletes during the winter games. I do believe this fabrication is going to go well beyond that to serving healthcare professionals within hospitals and offices and clinics, and it's a really, really great lightweight durable fabric that is awesome. You're going to love it.

Then finally, I think we've learned a lot in terms of how to optimize our marketing spend and how to ensure that we're really balanced across the funnel. I think you've seen that throughout this year, really taking these very strong top-of-funnel marketing campaigns that, in some ways, are breaking the Internet and how do we bring that all the way down to our healthcare professionals that are on social or across channels and to meet them where they are with really strong product that serves their needs and really strong messaging that resonates and really shows the best of them back to them. I think that's what this campaign is going to do again.

Then your question on non-scrubwear. In Q2, the growth rate was negative, and that was really impacted by comping over the same quarter of the prior year that had some additional non-scrubwear launches. What we've seen with category performance for non-scrubwear is that it can vary based on promotional comparisons, the impact of new styles in different quarters and our work to reinvent a few areas. Happy to see that we inflected positive in non-scrubwear this quarter.

Even still, we are comping against the stronger quarter last year from where we had Olympics. We had strong accessories and outerwear growth from Olympics last year that doesn't annualize this year. I would say that our non-scrubwear did perform to our plan and has outperformed the first half. We've been happy to see consistent attachment rates and really excited about the opportunity ahead for many of the categories within non- scrubwear.

Next question is from the line of Ashley Owens with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Ashley Owens
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Congrats as well. Maybe just first to touch on international. With this now being 16% of revenue of the quarter, if we kind of parse that out and think of that as just shy of $100 million run rate for the business, could you just walk us through some of the next building blocks as to how you're planning to scale these regions? I know regions like Japan, South Korea are still really new. China is obviously coming on board. Would just be curious on thoughts as to if international could sustainably grow at double digits for the next several quarters and how you're thinking about that long-term mix target there?

Catherine Spear
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean we have a two-pronged strategy, Ashley, in terms of where we go broad and where we go deep. It's been really exciting to see that we'll be at 60 markets by the end of this year. That's driven by our ability to leverage both technology and our understanding of each region and use the commonalities across regions to open up markets very efficiently. If you think about we just -- in Q3, we opened up 12 new markets, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, I won't list them all, but you can get that. Then in the fourth quarter, we opened up a number of countries in the Middle East and in Africa. That's really exciting.

Then to your point, how do we go deep, right? That's the second part of the strategy, where once certain markets reach scale, think about Canada, Mexico, U.K., Australia, we're able to really invest more in the brand and brand awareness. Really localized deeply, deeper engagement with our ambassadors with events, in-market support and so, and having talent on the ground in these places. It's very exciting to continue to build out in both -- in newer markets, but also really go deep in these larger markets that have hit what I would call critical mass. No matter where you live, prior to FIGS, you had this horrible experience with your uniform. Our goal is to get some more healthcare professionals around the world and help change the game for them.

Ashley Owens
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Then just quickly to follow-up. Maybe on the return rate improvement, if you could help us contextualize how much of the progress there benefited margin for the quarter or the magnitude of the decline you saw? Then just following up, moving down the P&L, any other quantifiable cost savings from fewer restocks and reverse logistics activity that you'd be willing to share?

Sarah Oughtred
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Within returns, we've seen overall improvement in our return rates, and that is largely attached to some of our improvements to fit. We definitely saw an outsized benefit related to returns processing. It is quite meaningful of a bump that we saw in Q2. You can really see how the implied guidance for Q4 does step down. That's both with tariffs and mix shift into non-scrubwear that seasonally happens in Q4, and not recognizing the same degree of benefit on returns that we saw in Q2.

Next question is from the line of John Kernan with TD Cowen.

John Kernan
TD Cowen, Research Division

Obviously, a lot of upside to on a few line items in Q3. And I just want to go back to the prior question on the fourth quarter guidance because it does assume quite a bit of the momentum on the margin level doesn't continue. Can you just unpack the gross margin and then maybe the selling and G&A in fourth quarter and the expectations there, given you have a lot of momentum coming out of Q3 on the top line and the margin profile? Just curious what's maybe changing in Q4.

Sarah Oughtred
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, certainly. We will have quite a step-up quarter-over-quarter from Q3 into Q4 on tariff impact. There will be quite a step-up on the incremental amount of tariffs that Q4 has to carry. That will continue to step up as we go into 2026 as a higher portion of our inventory captures the full amount of tariffs.

We also have seasonality to consider, so we have a much higher proportion of our business in the fourth quarter that has non-scrubwear that carries a lower margin rate. You'll kind of see that seasonal mix if you look back at the proportion of non-scrubwear business in Q4. Planning similarly, and that will have some drag on the quarter.

Then also just to consider from a year-over-year perspective, as you're looking at Q4 that we did have a sizable duty drawback benefit in the fourth quarter last year that was onetime catch-up, so we won't -- that will have a headwind into year-over-year growth in Q4 as well.

Then I think you're asking in terms of the overall P&L profile. I mean, as we think about our selling costs, we've continued to see improvement there each quarter and happy with our efforts there, and that will continue into Q4. A lot of really great work that's been done to negotiate with our vendors, bring on multi-carriers and at the same time, being able to provide even better service. That will continue into Q4.

From a marketing perspective, the marketing rate will increase in Q4 from what you've seen each quarter in 2025, and that's a function of us starting our investments to support the Olympics, which happened in Q1 of 2026. Then as we go into G&A, we've been continuing to see the decline in our stock comp expense year-over-year, and that trend will continue into Q4 as well. I think those are the main puts and takes on how we think about the profile for Q4.

Our final question will come from the line of Angus Kelleher with Barclays.

Angus Kelleher-Ferguson
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

This is Angus Kelleher on for Adrian. Congrats on a solid quarter. I wanted to ask how you are balancing -- how you're balancing the elevated inventory growth against the plan to pull back on promotions? What safeguards are in place there to avoid margin pressure or excess stock? I guess just more broadly, how do you feel about the composition of that inventory?

Sarah Oughtred
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks. We've been intentionally investing in inventory to support demand and improve our core in-stock levels. We've really seen improvement in those in-stock levels, which has been supporting our sales growth. We did have an impact from higher-than-expected in-transit inventory in the quarter, which we do view as positive as it does result from the work we're doing with our partners to drive consistency and execution, and it's ultimately driving shorter lead times.

If you were to adjust for that higher in-transit, our unit growth would be low double digits. So much more in line with our Q3 growth and our Q4 guide, while also giving us the opportunity to potentially capture upside. We're effectively getting product more efficiently, and we do need to adjust. As we look at the go forward, we would expect some moderation in unit growth, and that's really just as this in-transit timing adjusts.

Then from a dollar growth perspective, we actually expect that to increase into the fourth quarter, and that's really a function of those tariffs impacting that inventory that's coming in, so our inventory is higher. We do have some pockets of inventory that we are working down. We've got some older fit profiles and areas we intend to reinvest in the future seasons. We have made some good progress here, including with our targeted promotional efforts and selective write-offs we were able to do. We do continue to make progress here and in the quarters ahead. We're working on improving greater discipline and efficiency to our buying process. Over time, we do expect that inventory balance to come down over 2026 despite the higher tariffs.

Angus Kelleher-Ferguson
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Then if I could just squeeze one last one in about Teams. How is the Teams strategy evolving? How has the target customer shifted over time there? Then just if possible, any margin commentary you could share on the contribution of that business?

Catherine Spear
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Well, first off, Angus, I just want to thank you for not ending on the inventory question. Thank you for adding something about Teams because I'm so excited to talk about our Teams business. It's really -- we've been really focused on investing in our Teams business as we look to ensure an optimal foundation to set us up for the future. We've talked about our outbound strategy, bringing on new institutions that are looking to standardize and brand their teams, and we've made a lot of progress.

The biggest kind of item that we're excited about is the upgraded technology. We mentioned it in the earlier part of this call, and so this is really designed for healthcare teams of all types and sizes. This platform is going to give organizations much more flexibility and functionality to purchase in a way that makes sense for their team. We are on our way to becoming the employee store for all different types of healthcare professionals that's going to go well beyond traditional group ordering.

This is going to introduce new capabilities like sipeins, like gifting, different types of discounts based on your employee type. We're really excited about being able to roll out this upgraded Teams experience. It's going to feature our full product assortment. It's also going to be able to support international teams customers, which hasn't been the case. We think we're going to be able to unlock meaningful growth in the future. And so -- and then you asked about the margin.

Sarah Oughtred
Chief Financial Officer

The margin profile. The teams profitability is accretive bottom line. It has a lower gross margin profile just to the offering of a higher discount. Then operating expense structure is much more favorable with the efficiencies, both within outbound shipping as well as marketing. I'm excited with the overall economics that this business provides.

There are no additional questions waiting at this time. I'll pass the call back to Trina Spear for any closing remarks.
