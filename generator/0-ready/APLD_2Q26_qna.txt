[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nick Giles from B. Riley Securities.

Nick Giles
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

My first question was just -- I was hoping to get a sense for your growth appetite in the cloud business. Good to see the announcement there for ChronoScale. Should we expect the Applied platform to be a host for any future GPU purchases? Or how could Applied ultimately help attract incremental customers in -- for ChronoScale?

Wesley Cummins
Chairman, CEO, President, Secretary & Treasurer

Thanks, Nick. We've had a lot of discussions around that. So I think one of the key advantages that ChronoScale will have is the relationship with Applied Digital and access to large-scale data center facilities, deploying the accelerated compute, whether it be GPUs or TPUs or LPUs is part of the equation, but having access to large-scale data center facilities to actually make those deployments is a bigger part of the equation right now. And I think that's going to give that platform an advantage having the relationship with Applied Digital. We've had some of those discussions. We don't really want to get into how that will work in the future, but I do think that's a big advantage for the cloud business as it spins out.

Nick Giles
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

Got it. I appreciate that, Wes. My second one was just you signed an agreement for a limited notice to proceed with Babcock & Wilcox, and I was just wondering if you could touch on the opportunity there. What kind of optionality does this really give you going forward? And what should we be looking for in the upcoming contract release?

Wesley Cummins
Chairman, CEO, President, Secretary & Treasurer

The -- so for us, with the BW solution is a very unique solution and an exciting solution in the market because it uses older technology or an older process, which has been proven out for 100-plus years. It's using steam turbines, think of coal plant boilers, but we're using natural gas. That company has actually made a lot of coal and natural gas conversions over the past decade plus, and what it allows us to do is go to market earlier. If you get in line for natural gas -- traditional natural gas turbine right now, if we put an order in today, we're probably not getting delivery until 2031, 2032. For that equipment, we need power earlier than that. We are working with our utility partners, specifically now in the Dakotas, but expect to in other states as well, the initial reaction from those utilities has been overwhelmingly positive and really interested in the solution that the utilities -- any utility in the country knows who BW is. The company has been around for a long time, very good reputation.

And for us to be able to bring a product forward 3, 4-plus years to be able to generate power in the near term is the big advantage for those utilities and for us. And I think you should expect to see more information about that in the first quarter as we proceed with a site and an actual schedule for build on that equipment. But it provides a really good option for Applied Digital to expand its current campuses and future campuses faster than we would be able to otherwise.

Next question comes from the line of Darren Aftahi from ROTH Capital.

Darren Aftahi
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

Congrats on the progress. Two, if I may. Wes, can you just talk generally about the landscape for leases and how pricing may have changed over the last 6 months? Like is it improving, staying the same, going down?

And then second question, can you just talk a little bit about the pre-lease financing? I appreciate what it's actually doing. But like what does that say about your confidence when you're progressing on sites where you don't have signed leases? Just any kind of commentary and context would be great.

Wesley Cummins
Chairman, CEO, President, Secretary & Treasurer

Sure. So I'll start with pricing and Darren, I'll keep it specifically to us. I don't want to speak for the market at large. But I would say, generally, pricing has been stable to slightly better over the past 6 months. The demand profile for the past 6 months has been extraordinarily robust. There's -- I always want to expand a little bit on this with contracting. There's the headline price that you'll see in contracts and a calculated yield, which is using an estimated cost to build. That's one aspect of it.

What I would say, though, that's as important or even more important is we're getting more favorable terms in other aspects of the contract that we focus on very acutely for things like cancellation of transferability, a lot of the things that make these contracts for us, much more rock solid over that 15-year time frame. And we're getting a lot more favorable treatment in those aspects as an example, our current contracts are really noncancelable for 15 years. The customer can cancel for convenience. However, they owe us the 15 years of payments if they do, so that's typically referred to as a make-whole or a cancellation in the contract. So we've been able to get that 100% make whole transferability that doesn't allow them to transfer to a credit rating. It's either equal or higher. There's a lot of things that go into the contracting. So I would just say, in general, the contracting environment has gotten more favorable over the past 6 months.

And then on the Macquarie equipment facility and us announcing that, I think you should think back to what we did for our facility in Harwood, North Dakota. We did something very similar. And at the time, I spoke about that as well as -- we will go forward with groundwork, breaking ground, getting the project moving when we have a high degree of confidence that we're going to find a lease at a new campus or new campuses and that facility. We use that same style of facility. Now we've made that facility effectively at Evergreen so that we can continue to draw and pay it back. But we use that in Harwood. We paid that back with the draw on Macquarie Asset Management. We've now drawn down again. We purchased some land and some other equipment. We'll start construction on at least one new campus by the end of January. And that's because we have a high degree of confidence that we're going to sign a lease with a new customer that is different. And we've set investment-grade hyperscaler, it's different than the original one we signed in Harwood. And that's the goal for us.

Darren, we have a lot of momentum. So we've talked a lot about this before where we're qualified with most of the investment-grade hyperscalers are really focused on fixed companies total here. And so we want to add new locations, and we want to add new customers. So we diversify both in location and by customer and we expect to have a lot of success on that in 2026, and with what we're doing and what you're seeing the actions are now, you should expect that we think it's going to be in very early '26.

Your next question comes from the line of Rob Brown from Lake Street Capital Markets.

Robert Brown
Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division

Congratulations as well on all the progress. Just back to the ChronoScale spinout, I think you said midyear for kind of closing. What's the -- give us a sense of what steps have to happen between now and then in terms of getting finalized agreement and a closing step? What sort of has to happen here?

Wesley Cummins
Chairman, CEO, President, Secretary & Treasurer

Sure. So it technically will be a merger, Rob. And so we'll get to a definitive -- hopefully later this month or early in February. And then there would just be a process for a shareholder vote to complete the merger. I think in the first half of '26 is the expectation. I think if I were handicapping it, on the very, very early side in March, but I would expect kind of the April-May time frame as we go forward with that.

Robert Brown
Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then as you kind of think about that business and the growth possibly there, I think you said $60 million trailing or $75 million, I think, [ you said ] sort of perspective. What's sort of the growth opportunity? Is there additional capacity that can get leased out as a stand-alone business? Or do you expect -- I assume you expect some growth in capacity as well, but just a sense of the growth opportunity there?

Wesley Cummins
Chairman, CEO, President, Secretary & Treasurer

Yes. So just for context on this, Rob, when we announced back in April, we were -- we put that into discontinued ops. We are seeking strategic alternatives. We evaluated a lot of alternatives. But while we were evaluating those alternatives, I think that market changed pretty significantly. And what we're seeing is a big opportunity in the compute side of the market, obviously, the data center side as well, but the compute side of the market, you're seeing a lot of deals happen over the past 3 or 4 months in that part of the market.

We're involved in -- with a lot of those counterparties and discussions that have been, and we think there's a really large opportunity for our cloud business as we spin it out into ChronoScale to get some of those types of contracts. And we're working with us. We think there's a really unique relationship there where we can get data center capacity to be able to deploy significant scale for those style of contracts with those customers. And so we think this is the absolute best path for value creation for our shareholders to let this company spin out and capture that opportunity and raise its own capital and get on its own growth trajectory, which we just haven't focused on for the past 8 months. So we think there's a huge opportunity there, and you can see the stuff that's going on in the market, and we're really well positioned to capture some of those opportunities.

Next question comes from the line of Mike Grondahl from Northland Securities.

Mike Grondahl
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

You've mentioned a couple of times advanced discussions. Can you talk a little bit about how many sites you're having advanced discussions about like how many megawatts just so we can get a feel kind of a sense of the breadth that you're talking about?

Wesley Cummins
Chairman, CEO, President, Secretary & Treasurer

Sure. I think we've talked about 2 or 3 sites. So I'll tell you, it's -- we're in advanced discussion on 3 sites in 900 megawatts.

Mike Grondahl
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

Great. 3 sites in 900 megawatts. And then, Wes, how are you thinking about the pipeline today? How would you characterize that pipeline?

Wesley Cummins
Chairman, CEO, President, Secretary & Treasurer

The pipeline remains robust. I will say, Mike, when I think about the business, and it's been like this for the past few months, I'm thinking less about the demand side of the equation, and I talked about this a lot on the last call, which is our ability to scale, our ability to scale across multiple sites then do construction across multiple sites and how many sites can we do construction across and the team spent a lot of time in 2025, and we'll continue in '26, working on our ability to scale and execute these projects at the size that we're doing across multiple sites. So it's less on the demand side because that's not been really the issue for us or really, I think the issue for the industry.

We'll focus more on how much can we do and how much can we build from a supply chain perspective, from a personnel perspective, on an annualized basis. And so I don't think demand is going to be the limiter for us, but I want to make sure -- we always want to make sure that we're delivering on time and on budget for our customers. And I don't want to go too far out. We haven't hit that limit yet but it's the piece that I think about a lot, and we internally think about a lot is what is the limit for us on an annual basis. It's a large number but that's really more of the limiting factor for us and not what the demand picture looks like.

Next question comes from the line of George Sutton from Craig-Hallum.

George Sutton
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

Wes, you mentioned having been qualified by a few of the investment-grade hyperscalers, can you just talk about what that means when we talk about being in advanced discussions, I mean, how much more simplicity of getting something across the finish line is there once you've gone through that process versus hypothetically someone new in the market?

Wesley Cummins
Chairman, CEO, President, Secretary & Treasurer

So what I would say generally and I'm going to only be able to reference our experience. So getting onboarded, getting to the point where you signed a master agreement that governs typically work orders or service orders you'll sign underneath of that can be anywhere from -- on the low end, 3 months to -- on the high end 9 months to a year, and so we've been through the process there for most of these hyperscalers. So there's the 6 that we target, which are the 5 investment-grade hyperscalers and then CoreWeave. So we're through -- out of those 6, we're through that process with 5 of those. And so I think we're in a really good position.

And so if we've already been through that process, doing a new building even if -- a new building on the same campus or expansion in the current building or doing even a new campus if you're through that with one of those hyperscalers is a much shortened time frame, abbreviated time frame to get to that actual contract versus starting from scratch.

George Sutton
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

Got you. So I want to put a couple of things together, and if you can help me. You were on CNBC the other day, mentioned, by the way, movie star quality experience, frankly. But you mentioned you had done $16 billion of deals in '25, and that you would anticipate doing that or potentially better in '26. And I want to dovetail that with what you just said on we're late stage with 3 sites in 900 megawatts. Am I kind of putting these things all together correctly?

Wesley Cummins
Chairman, CEO, President, Secretary & Treasurer

Yes, I think that's correct. What I would just add to that on the -- George, on the 900 megawatts, I don't want to set the expectation that all of that is done at the same time. That could be one at a time. It could be none. We've been through enough of this. George, you've been through this with us as we've gone through the last few years. Nothing is done until it's done. That's just what we're working through right now. But that's -- those two going together, I think, you're reading that correctly.

Next question comes from the line of John Todaro from Needham & Company.

John Todaro
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Wes, you spent a good amount of time talking about how, I guess, supply and execution is a little bit more of the difficulty part than demand. I think you ultimately ended ahead of schedule in that first build for CoreWeave. Can you just walk us through maybe what you learned from that execution and give us confidence in how you'd be able to continue to execute on those builds on the development side? And then I have a follow-up.

Wesley Cummins
Chairman, CEO, President, Secretary & Treasurer

Yes. So we learned a lot going through that process on that first building, and we've made a lot of refinements -- typically, John, I think you've probably heard me talk about this before. So for us, one of the things I think differentiates us in the market is we started on this path back in 2022. We've stubbed our toe in a lot of different ways through the years. Luckily, we did most of that at a very small scale, but we had a lot of lessons on that first building, and you can see that reflected in design change, and then construction change and how we operate all the way through our supply chain and standardizing a lower amount of SKUs, lower amount of suppliers, all of these things that streamline the process that we do to build these facilities. And so we feel like we have a really good handle on our construction time lines. There's always things that can cause a problem that are out of our control on construction. One of the things I always worry about is weather, but we've built -- I think this is our fourth year in a row building in North Dakota in the wintertime. So we're pretty accustomed to that as well.

But we have -- we went back securing supply chain well over a year ago, 18 months plus ago, and we thought we were really forward thinking on locking in 600, 700 megawatts of MEP per year that we have for us. Now we're working to expand that. That fits what we're doing right now, but I think that needs to go larger for us. So -- but we feel good about our processes we have in place and kind of the maturation of the construction and development group versus what we did on building 1. I'm proud of -- I'm really proud for the entire team that we delivered that on time and on budget for our customer. But we have to continue to do that.

We feel really good about where we are for the CoreWeave building that we're expecting to deliver in the middle part of this year and the building in Harwood we're expecting to deliver shortly after that. And then the next two buildings after that, both in Ellendale and then in Harwood. So we're feeling really good about where we are on schedule. But it's about the fact that we have streamlined this and we're on, what I call our fourth generation design has really helped us in simplifying the process and streamlining the process and being one of the companies that does deliver on time.

John Todaro
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

That's great. And then just a quick follow-up. I think you've mentioned in the past getting calls from entities with sort of stranded power. And it sounded like there might be a little bit more pockets of available power out there than some of us in the industry had initially thought. Could you just maybe frame that up? Is there still additional kind of pockets to acquire more fairly near-term power? And maybe talk to your color on that?

Wesley Cummins
Chairman, CEO, President, Secretary & Treasurer

Yes. We keep finding more opportunities, more and more opportunities. Everything we're in process with right now is organic. So we have a large amount in-flight that is organic. But we continue to see opportunities, third-party opportunities. We continue to evaluate those opportunities. And some of those, really, for us, it could be in a different geographic market for us, that is a really attractive market. But we continue to look at that. But everything we're doing right now is organic, but we see those, I would say, daily -- weekly at least, but typically multiple times in a week.

Your last question comes from the line of Michael Donovan from Compass Point.

Michael Donovan
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. Following up on Mike's pipeline question, can you touch upon expansion opportunities at PF-1 and PF-2? Do you still have confidence in those reaching 1.4 gigawatts and 1 gigawatt, respectively? And I have a follow-up.

Wesley Cummins
Chairman, CEO, President, Secretary & Treasurer

Yes. So every one of our campuses, I think this is an important point. Every one of our campuses has the potential to go to at least a gigawatt. And some significantly beyond a gigawatt. But when we think about our goals inside the company, we have two campuses now that can each go to 2 gigawatt or more. So we have that pipeline in the future for ourselves, we're working on three additional campuses. We're working on a lot more than that. But think of -- things we're in advanced stage on three more campuses. Each one of them can scale to 2 gigawatt capacity. So for us, if we put those in place, those contracts in place, we have different customers on those campuses.

We have a view and a pretty clear path to whether it's by 2030 or 2031 or 2032 to growing our capacity to 5 gigawatts, if we don't add another campus after that. We would expect that we would, but it puts a really good growth path out for the company just having these campuses in place, just getting the 2 gigawatts, if we were talking about this a year ago, would be monumental for us. But if we can expand to 5 campuses and have a clear path to 5 gigawatts plus of capacity over the next 5 years. That's a really great position for [ us ]. But all of those campuses have that expansion potential.

Michael Donovan
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Great. I appreciate that. And with the discussions around NVIDIA this week with liquid-cooling [ via ] Rubins, can you discuss a bit on what makes Corintis a competitive solution?

Wesley Cummins
Chairman, CEO, President, Secretary & Treasurer

So Corintis is really interesting. You could go and look at their technology. They had a very nice announcement with Microsoft, I think, a couple of months ago. What we like about it is Corintis has a cold plate technology that I liken to semiconductor and then module. A lot of semiconductors are built into modules. So they have the technology that I would classify in this case, a semiconductor, which is a specially designed patterned cold plate that is dependent on each chip individually. So whether it's B200, B300, Rubin, whatever it might be, they map that chip. They make the heat points of that chip. They design the cold plate with a lot of micro channels through it. And then it goes into a full cold plate and it sits on top right now. But this technology is designed to go inside the semiconductor packaging in the future and then actually inside the manufacturing process in the [ epi ] for semiconductors. And the goal for this technology and a lot of this has proven out for them is that you can use -- if a chip goes, let's say, it's using 1 kilowatt down, but the next-generation chip uses 3 kilowatts or 5 kilowatts, this technology can use the same amount of liquid to chill chips as they go up. Now there's a point where that breaks and there's a change where we need more liquid. But from a data center operator perspective, when having that efficiency inside is always great for our customers, but to be able to deliver the same amount of liquid on the data center side for a chip that's 3x the power density of what we're currently running really helps us future-proof our infrastructure. And so we're really excited about that technology.
