Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Smith with Stifel.

Matthew Smith
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Billy, the fiscal 2026 outlook ranges, you know the benefit from import export activity building in the second half. Can you provide any color on the scope of the program? We calculate today that the percent of packs with the FET benefit's around 3%. And if the second half benefits are more weighted towards cost normalizing associated with the initiative versus increased volume throughput that would unlock greater tax efficiency?

William Gifford
CEO & Director

Yes. It's a little bit of both, Matt. We're a bit reluctant to share any of the specifics there, but certainly, there are some upfront investments that are moderate as we go through the year. We think those investments are wise. Not only are we able to make those investments and afford ourselves the opportunity of the duty drawback, but it also sets the manufacturing center that we have here in Richmond up to be available to produce for any market internationally, with some of the changes and differences in international markets versus the U.S. market.

In addition, as we've said previously, with the duty drawback, we're looking to not be at a competitive disadvantage regarding that, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to expand.

Matthew Smith
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I appreciate that perspective. And as a follow-up before I pass it along, the 2026 CapEx guide is elevated. I think that's associated with the investments you're talking about to unlock the double duty drawback efficiency. The $300 million to $375 million investment level, is that -- should we think of this as a onetime increase in CapEx? Or do you expect kind of a multiyear higher CapEx level as we look forward?

Salvatore Mancuso
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Matt, thanks for the question. You are correct. The primary driver of the increase is the -- are the investments for our import export business. I'll repeat what Billy said, it not only provides us the ability to participate in the duty drawback, but it does provide us with capabilities for our longer-term vision. I would say obviously, we're not going to guide for future CapEx, but we are making investments today. They generally precede the volume, if you think about it for the import export, but we're also making investments in our smoke-free portfolio.

Obviously, we want to have the appropriate manufacturing capability for products like on! PLUS and future pipeline products. We believe that for a company of our size, it's still a relatively low level of capital expenditures, but we're going to be disciplined and diligent when we make those capital investments.

We'll move next to Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.

Bonnie Herzog
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I guess I also had a couple of questions on the double duty drawback. I guess first, is it fair to assume your aggressive promotional strategy behind Basic, which is weighing on your net price realization and dollar OCI growth in smokeable? I mean, has that been implemented with the idea that these pressures can be offset this year as you ramp your import/export activity with KT&G? And then I guess without a pretty big step-up of this activity, it does seem like your smokeable dollar profit growth will likely remain negative, which could put you at the low end of your full year EPS guidance, right? So just any thoughts on that would be appreciated.

William Gifford
CEO & Director

Yes, I would disaggregate those two. Everyone wants to keep combining those two decisions, and we see them as independent of one another. Certainly, we're not going to be at a competitive disadvantage for the duty drawback, as we discussed earlier. I think when you think about the strategy around Basic, remember that's only deployed in, call it, roughly over 30,000 stores. So it's not a nationwide type effort. What we saw there were a number of stores where the consumer has been under severe economic pressures. And that's really -- the major cause of that has been the cumulative inflation that the consumer has been experiencing.

And we felt it wise and prudent to invest behind Basic, not much different than if you go back in history, Basic before and then L&M at other times, now we're repositioning Basic. And so in those 30,000 stores, we are able to apply the revenue growth management analytics that we have invested in and you see the superb performance of Basic, what it does is it captures consumers that would have gone to deep discount. And it allows us to capture it with latent equity and as the economic situation changes for our consumers adjust accordingly.

Bonnie Herzog
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

All right. And then any thoughts on just this notion of if you don't get a lot more activity to import export, just thinking about the EPS range you put out there, which is pretty wide.

William Gifford
CEO & Director

It's not any wider, Bonnie, if you go back, we typically open the year with about a 3% range. And then we [indiscernible] accordingly as we move through the year and have more insight to how the year is going to play out. We feel very pleased to be able to provide the range that we provided and look forward to continuing through the year.

Bonnie Herzog
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then maybe just a little bit of a follow-up, it just as we're talking about Basic, but -- so then it does beg a question on Marlboro. Your retail share on the brand did drop below 40% for the first time, I think, ever. So how are you thinking about your strategy behind Marlboro? And then how much of your promotional strategy on Basic is maybe cannibalizing Marlboro? So I guess, Billy, maybe I'd love to hear whether or not you might consider changing your strategy on Marlboro? And are you maybe rethinking your strategy to balance share with the goal of driving profitability?

William Gifford
CEO & Director

Yes. I think it's important, Bonnie, to remember the strategy we use to manage the smokable stuff. It's to maximize profitability over the long term while making appropriate investments in Marlboro and the growth categories and we feel like we're executing against that. And so when you think about Marlboro overall, we feel very good about the strength of the brand. Certainly, in the fourth quarter, you saw product availability in the e-vapor related to enforcement. And I think it's intuitive that the consumer was feeling some price break when they moved over to e-vapor, as that product availability is no longer available.

And I don't want you to think that the consumer is moving back and forth. It's primarily dual consumers, those that are using cigarettes and those that are using e-vapor and they decide on the occasion which product to use. As product availability was much less due to enforcement, and they went back to more cigarette occasions in their day, it's intuitive that discounts brands benefited from that. I think through time, we'll see if that holds true or not. I think from a standpoint of your question related to Marlboro versus Basic, we feel like with our analytics, we feel comfortable that it's not impacting or cannibalizing Marlboro in the marketplace.

Certainly, from a mathematical standpoint, the more Basic grows, its share grows and it affects the brands in the marketplace, but we don't feel like it's having any outsized impact on Marlboro.

We'll take our next question from Eric Serotta with Morgan Stanley.

Eric Serotta
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just wondering, first, if you have any commentary or color around some of the articles in kind of popular press lately about increase in smoking incidents among younger 20-something legal-aged nicotine users? We don't really seem to see it in the data yet, but you guys have better data on this than anyone. So wondering if you're seeing any increased incidents among any of the younger legal cohorts?

And then a separate question. Looking at on! PLUS, could you talk a bit about the pricing strategy there? Where you plan to position it sort of as you get past the initial introductory and trial periods? Do you think that, that could command a premium to the classic and what you're thinking about in terms of pricing there?

William Gifford
CEO & Director

Yes, thanks for the questions. I think related to your first one, I would refer you to the Vision, which is to move consumers in a responsible fashion to smoke-free products. Nothing in the trends that I would point to. I've seen some of the same stories you have. And that is why we've been asking the FDA for an expedited authorization process, so you can get smoke-free products in the marketplace and inform consumers about the risk of the various forms of nicotine in the marketplace.

As far as on! PLUS pricing, while I'll be careful not to play out our whole strategy, that we do believe on! PLUS is a differentiated product and commands a premium in the marketplace and I would really direct you to go on nicotine.com. And what you can see is the price differential where e-commerce now is live on a national basis, you'll see the price differential that on! PLUS is listed at there versus on! classic. So we feel good about the strategy.

Certainly, as we introduce the retail, we'll have various introductory price promotions, and that can vary state by state. So we'll continue to use our analytics, but we feel very excited about the differentiation we have and the consumer feedback related to that differentiation.

Eric Serotta
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. And then just one follow-up on the double duty drawback, not to beat a dead horse here. But just in terms of sizing the potential here, can you talk or provide any color on what you're doing here that may be apart from the KT&G partnership or relationship? Are there things that are already in place, things that are set to ramp, I guess, separate from KT&G? Just looking for -- to see if there was any scope apart from one partnership here and how you're thinking about adding capacity?

William Gifford
CEO & Director

Yes, I think when you think about it, the capital in that opportunity is truly the matching of exports with imports. And as much as you can match on those, that is the -- if you will, the cap through time, related to what's the opportunity. As far as specifics around individual companies or partners that we have relationships with, I'm not going to get into the detail there. Know that we are continuing to seek opportunities because we're not going to be put at a competitive disadvantage related to those other competitors that have both foreign or international manufacturing capacity and U.S.-based. So we'll continue to seek opportunities as we go through time.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Faham Baig with UBS.

Mirza Faham Baig
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

A couple of questions from me as well. If I could come back to the controllable costs, I calculate they were up 14.5% in the quarter, and that sort of compares to a 9-month run rate of 9.5%. Was the investment behind this import and export the sole reason behind the different outcome in the fourth quarter? Or would there be any other factors that you would point to? I would think the former is one-off in nature, but it would be good if you could clarify that as well.

And I guess, secondly, I have a few clarifications on nicotine pouches. Do I understand that you will be national with on! PLUS in the first half of this year? Or you plan to start the national rollout? And I presume as you've sort of passed this comment, there aren't any sort of supply chain issues that you would be worried about? And then the second clarification is on the momentum in on! PLUS. I know it's been in the market for a few weeks now. Are you able to provide any in-state data from a market share perspective that you may have seen in the early readings that we can try and extrapolate from, please?

William Gifford
CEO & Director

Yes, so we'll try to unpack all of those. I'll let Sal start with controllable costs, but if we miss any, please follow up.

Salvatore Mancuso
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Faham, you are correct. It is predominantly the investments we are making around our manufacturing process for import export. If you think about it, there were different pack configurations, as an example. There are different capabilities we need for international markets. An example would be track and trace capabilities. So those investments precede really the volume and revenue you get from the export volume. So that is the driver that you are seeing.

William Gifford
CEO & Director

Yes. As far as nicotine pouches, you're correct, we'll be national through the first half of this year, 2026. As far as momentum, while I would love to be able to share exact volumes or exact shares, it was a bit messy. You'll recall, we launched in 3 states. Then we halted shipments to those 3 states related to the pilot program that was kicked off by the FDA. We have now launched back into those 3 states or resumed shipments. And again, we'll be national through the first half of this year.

What we can share is the positive feedback anecdotally we received from consumers. It really supported some of the research we had where the consumer really sees differentiation in the mouth feel and the softness of the pouch paired with great flavor. And so we're excited to be able to bring that national as we progress through the first half of this year.

We'll move next to Pallav Mittal with Barclays.

Pallav Mittal
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I have three of them. Firstly, just a follow up. So on this on! PLUS distribution, if I could just ask, I mean, why are you starting with these three states and not go out national from the start because we do have the distribution in place already? And [indiscernible], is there any inventory benefit from on! PLUS in the Q4 numbers?

William Gifford
CEO & Director

Yes. So from a standpoint, really no benefit in Q4. Remember, we had just initially started distribution in the 3 states, and then we halted that as we progressed through the end of the year. So we had very minimal and it was a bit messy. I think when you think about why the 3 states versus national, it was easy. The sales force had already sold it into retailers, it was easy to turn those shipments back on and they're in the process of doing that on a national basis. So that will follow as we progress through the first half of 2026. I think that got all of your questions, but if I missed one, please follow up.

Pallav Mittal
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

That was the first one. Sir, secondly, if I can ask in your comments, you said that the pricing from competitors in nicotine pouches was down 3% sequentially and 12% Y-o-Y. But that is not what I think Scanner data suggests, and it seems pricing is rather up for the larger players. So can you just help us understand what we are missing there? Is there anything in terms of promotions or trade margins or some other factors?

William Gifford
CEO & Director

Yes, so you're correct. We did say down 3% sequentially 12% for the year from a competitive standpoint. That's all competitors combined. I think what you saw was a significant competitor promotion that took place in the third quarter into the fourth, where free cans were distributed for any nicotine purchase. That had a significant impact on competitive pricing in the marketplace. As far as -- and we're excluding, if you will, on! classic. From on! classic, we were up in price, both sequentially and total year.

So that was the comparison we were trying to draw that there's significant promotional activity in nicotine pouch both in the third quarter and the fourth quarter.

[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Damian McNeela with Deutsche.

Damian McNeela
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

The first question is just on the basic strategy. And can you clarify or confirm that the 30,000 stores that you targeted is kind of the ceiling? Or are there any potential stores that you may consider entering into during the course of '26? This is the first question. The second question is just, are you able to sort of indicate the payback time from the investment that you're making in manufacturing facilities to help import exports? And then the last one is just on the step-up in costs that you saw in Q4, are they likely to repeat in Q1 and Q2? Or are they done now? And it's the second half will see an improvement because you're seeing improved import export volumes?

William Gifford
CEO & Director

Yes. So I'll take the first one and then I'll turn it over to Sal. As far as Basic again, slightly over 30,000 stores currently. We'll continue to monitor the situation. We want to be there for our consumer that's under economic pressure. We feel like it's prudent, Basic has performed very well. As I mentioned earlier, L&M used to play that role for us, and we've increased profitability on L&M. And it allows us, as the economic situation changes, we're still in connection and the consumers in our portfolio of brands.

We're able to have conversations with them through time. And as that economic situation changes, you can look to see us adjust priced versions in the marketplace. So we feel like it's good as far as number of stores, it will make adjustments around the fringes, but we feel like we're in the right group of stores, but we'll continue to monitor that as we go through 2026.

Salvatore Mancuso
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. And Damian, to your other two questions, the return on investment for the import export is very strong. The payback is less than a year. As far as continued spending, as Billy pointed out earlier, the back half weighted nature of our EPS growth guidance really is both volume and costs. So there are some incremental costs that continue to happen before you realize the revenue, and that happens when you enter different markets or different partnership arrangements. So yes, we expect some elevated investments upfront as you get more volume through the import export process.
