[Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America.

Ruplu Bhattacharya
BofA Securities, Research Division

Mike, you raised the full year revenue guide by over $1 billion. There's lots of things that are happening in the Intelligent Infrastructure space. The slides mentioned some new wins. Can you give us some more color on those? There are a lot of new projects coming up as well, like the OpenAI/AMD or the Anthropic/AWS. I mean do you think Jabil has the intent or the opportunity to benefit from some of those projects? And then there are other things you mentioned like retrofitting factories for liquid cooling and acquiring Hanley Energy Group. So maybe just lay out for us the impact of all of these factors. And overall, would you say the guidance is for the fiscal year is still conservative?

Michael Meheryar Dastoor
CEO & Director

Thanks, Ruplu. So I really think our Intelligent Infrastructure is outperforming. I -- one of the reasons I think our AI strategy is working so well is because of the holistic view that we're taking of data centers. We're not just focused on single products or product lines, we're actually invested in design and engineering across the board, which allows us to cross-pollinate, which allows us to cross-sell, which allows us to use our liquid cooling capability with some of the server racks and other parts of our Intelligent Infrastructure business. So Intelligent Infrastructure performing really well. I think in '25, our revenue was $9 billion. In September, we've taken it to $11.2 billion, which was up 25%. We've now taken it up to $12.1 billion, which is 35%, about a $900 million increase in that revenue level. I think out of the $900 million, think of it in 2 buckets.

One is the Cloud & DCI bucket, which is up about $600 million. $200 million of that is Hanley, and I'll touch on that in a minute. The balance is made up of upside on some recent wins that we had maybe during Q4 of last year with our second hyperscaler, and that's in Mexico. It's all AI storage racks that we're manufacturing for that second hyperscaler. And then on the DCI business in Memphis, I think there's a whole bunch of upsides there. The switchgear business is going really well. The in-row heat exchangers, again, going really well. So Cloud & DCI up by $600 million in total. Networking and comms is up by about $300 million, and that's mainly in our India operations around air and liquid-cooled switches, adapters, network adapters across Inteliband (sic) [ Infiniband ] and the Ethernet portfolio.

So $900 million is a big number for us to be taking it up in a short -- a relatively short period of time. On Hanley, if I could just touch on that, I think the revenues that we indicated in my prepared remarks is about $200 million for FY '26. We expect it to complete in January. I would think of Hanley as being modestly accretive in '26. '27 will be when it's more accretive. It's like I think everybody knows it's a power an energy management solutions company that we acquired. It's more a services-enabled business as opposed to manufacturing. And it gives us a really good sort of platform, not just for deployments, but for maintenance as well, which will be an ongoing revenue stream. So overall, really happy with Hanley. Do I think guidance is conservative? I think it's appropriately conservative. We're seeing solid upsides everywhere. And as is normal, we've been appropriately conservative there, Ruplu.

Ruplu Bhattacharya
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. For my follow-up, if I can ask, looking at operating margins, Jabil is going to be at 5.7% operating margin this fiscal year. So is it reasonable for investors to assume that operating margin can get above 6% in fiscal '27? What are the puts and takes there? And longer term, how high can operating margin go? Like with the current mix of business, do you see Jabil getting to 7% operating margin at some point? So just your thoughts on next year -- or what should we keep in mind in terms of operating margin progression and how high that can go over time?

Michael Meheryar Dastoor
CEO & Director

So Ruplu, we've still got 3 quarters left in FY '26, so we're just going to be focused on that. We'll provide guidance near the time for FY '27. As you know, we increased our margin from 5.6% to 5.7% which is about 30 bps up from the '25 number, and that's for FY '26 due to 2 or 3 reasons, which is mainly better mix. I think the mix is coming in stronger, better utilization of capacity. Our capacity utilization has gone up from that 75% range closer to the 80% range and then SG&A leverage as well. So I think overall, the incremental revenue that we're seeing, the $1.1 billion that you referenced earlier, that's giving us some nice leverage. In FY '27, we will be seeing a full year impact of Hanley.

So there will be some level of accretion on the margin there. And then we'll see continued leverage from the incremental revenues. The pipeline that I'm seeing, Ruplu, is extremely strong. It's been a long time since I've seen such a healthy pipeline. So I feel better about 6% than I ever have. I think if you're asking beyond 6% and getting to 7%, of course, we're not going to stop getting leverage. We're not going to stop getting efficiencies as soon as we hit 6%. So 6% is just a point in time on a march to a much higher number. Is it '27, '28, '29, I don't know. 6%, though, I feel really good about at this stage for future.

Ruplu Bhattacharya
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. If I can sneak one more in. Looking at Healthcare & Packaging, for the last 3, 4 years, it's been mostly flat. This year, it's growing low single digits to $5.6 billion. Any thoughts like you had talked about some further J&J type of deals, and you've got this impact from Croatia. So just can you give us some more color on how you think that business can evolve? Is it still a low single-digit business going forward? Or do you think it can accelerate?

Michael Meheryar Dastoor
CEO & Director

So Croatia is going really well. I think we've always referenced sometime in '27, maybe second half of '27 is when it actually starts delivering some good returns. Again, just to remind you, the margin is higher in that GLP-1 space. So Croatia going really well. As opposed to -- on the whole deal piece, I do think the team is actively working all of that. They're currently engaged in B2B conversations. They're engaged in M&A sort of capability-driven type of sort of deals as well. So it's an active sort of process that we're going through right now, and we'll provide updates again throughout FY '26 in terms of what we're seeing out there from a deal. And again, just to remind you, the deals that we're looking at mainly would be sort of add capabilities so that we can go vertical in the Healthcare space, a bit like our -- the GLP-1 OSD transaction that we did last year, where we added a capability on pharma sort of filling of the GLP-1s itself, oral doses, et cetera. So there'll be more of those, more capability driven across the board where we operate.

Our next questions come from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.

Manmohanpreet Singh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

This is MP on for Samik Chatterjee. Firstly, congratulations on great results. My question is on second hyperscaler. I think you highlighted second hyperscaler driving upside to your Intelligent Infrastructure outlook for the year. Like how much of it is your better execution relative to your customer demand versus customer actually preponing their deployment plans? And then in the past, you have highlighted $750 million of revenue scale for this business for FY '26. Like how should we think about that scale now? And then any color on the broader potential hyperscaler customers, like how exactly those discussions are going? And then I have a follow-up.

Michael Meheryar Dastoor
CEO & Director

Yes. So the upside on the second hyperscaler, as I mentioned earlier on, is on the AI storage piece. We continue to get some upsides on that business. I'm not sure if that's predeployment or it's just the demand has always been there. It's a matter of fulfilling it. I -- we feel really good about upside even from there on some of these hyperscalers that we're in discussion with. So I think if you're looking at the revenue piece for the second hyperscaler, roughly in that $1 billion range, I think earlier, we'd said $750 million. So taking that up by some amount as well. So really good interest levels coming through. And we're not just stopping with the second hyperscaler, we're in discussions with even more hyperscalers. So pipeline, again, looking very strong.

Manmohanpreet Singh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. And then my next question is around the gross margins for this quarter. I think like despite the revenues being higher quarter-over-quarter from F 4Q, like gross margins were lower. Like can you please help us understand the drivers for that?

Gregory Hebard
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So Q1, our gross margins were at 8.9%. Year-over-year, it is up 10 basis points. So typically, we do have a little bit of a lower gross margins on the year. So really nothing there other than just mix in Q1 for the gross margin piece.

Michael Meheryar Dastoor
CEO & Director

And Samik, we've always sort of mentioned 9% to 9.5% is a range for our gross margin. That's still the FY '26 estimate.

Our next questions come from the line of Steven Fox with Fox Advisors.

Steven Fox
Fox Advisors LLC

I had 2 questions, if I could. I guess, first of all, just switching gears. On the Healthcare business, like you mentioned, Mike, it's been very steady. My understanding, it's providing pretty good margins for you guys as well. I guess off of all the growth you're seeing in cloud, what's the prospects for maybe investing more aggressively to accelerate that growth since it's such a good contributor to profitability? And then I had a follow-up.

Michael Meheryar Dastoor
CEO & Director

Yes, so Steve, we're constantly evaluating M&A activity in that space. We're constantly in discussions on B2Bs. So I think it's highly likely that we'll do something. We're obviously a conservative company from an M&A perspective. So we'll do all the right groundwork for that. But I feel like Healthcare is such a steady business with higher margins, long, long product life cycles and steady cash flows that it's a great sort of offset from a diversification standpoint for us, and that is an area that I'm most excited about from a deal perspective.

Steven Fox
Fox Advisors LLC

Great. That's helpful. And then just on the cloud business. So a quarter ago, you were warning us about that you still face some bottlenecks later in the year. Now you're ahead of schedule a little bit, which is great. And you're talking about what sounds like a bigger pipeline. So I'm just wondering how do we sort of equate your ability to meet demand or meet the growth expectations of adding a new customer or existing customers with all the capacity you have or may need? Like how are you planning out beyond this year for capacity in order to continue to grow that cloud business?

Michael Meheryar Dastoor
CEO & Director

Yes. When we talked about the retrofitting piece on the September call, it was mainly associated with our with our hyperscaler factory on the East Coast of the U.S. A lot of the upside, when we talked about upside that $900 million, some of it is in Mexico, where we had some surplus capacity. Some of it is in India, where it's a combination of existing capacity and new capacity. As you know, North Carolina is coming up relatively soon in the next 6, 7, 8 months, and that we're prefitting, if you want to use that phrase for liquid cooling. So we've got some decent upsides. We're planning our capacity in that way. Memphis is another area I talked about. That's seeing some really good growth as well. So we might expand there as well. So there's current expansion plans that we're looking at, and those might be even sooner than the North Carolina facility. Again, it doesn't change our CapEx outlook. The CapEx outlook has been 1.5% to 2% of revenue, and that's going to remain consistent for FY '26.

Steven Fox
Fox Advisors LLC

Great. And thanks for all the visibility into your numbers. This was really helpful.

Michael Meheryar Dastoor
CEO & Director

Thanks, Steve.

Our next questions come from the line of Ruben Roy with Stifel.

Ruben Roy
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Mike, I wonder if you could spend a minute on just kind of longer-term thinking around Hanley. And I'm wondering, there's been a lot of discussion, obviously, around power and power distribution as the industry is trying to figure out how to get to 800 volt direct current. And if you think about this acquisition longer term, one of your competitors has been talking a lot about modularized power. Does this help you, do you think in terms of content per rack and maybe gaining more server rack business by having this? Or is the strategy maybe a little bit different as you think about adding that into the mix? And also one follow-up on that is, would they own the design of the power distribution? I imagine that the answer would be yes, given the EBIT margins that you get, but any color on that would be helpful.

Michael Meheryar Dastoor
CEO & Director

So I'd like to call out a couple of transactions as it relates to that whole thermal management piece. Obviously, Hanley as a service provider, I'll talk about that in a minute. But the liquid cooling acquisition we made with Mikros in '24 has also been a big game changer. I think thermal management, thermal dissipation is not new to hyperscalers, whether it's cooling at a chip level or a switch level or a component level or even at an infrastructure level with liquid heat exchanges. That's one of the reasons we invested in Mikros as we acquired a technology, we didn't acquire a product. We acquired a design and engineering team, which is constantly pushing the boundaries for forward-looking liquid cooling activity. So to me, that whole Mikros acquisition is a game changer.

I think particularly as the thermal management piece becomes more critical, the ability to design, the ability to engineer liquid cooling at chip level, at the network switch level, add different sort of parts and integrate into a full system. That's the big differentiator where Jabil steps in. As it relates to Hanley, it's more of a services organization. It's the provider of power and energy management solutions. I think the engineering expertise that we have in there is across power distribution, switchgear, energy monitoring, digital power management platforms. It allows us to go vertical as well. And I'll give you an example. Today, we build low voltage, medium voltage switchgear in Memphis. Hanley will allow us to deploy, install and then maintain those in data centers, which previously was done by other parties.

So if you sort of combine the whole server rack business with the ability to deploy, install and maintain, that is a highly accretive type of business for us. So Hanley, I think, is a really good transaction. We sort of welcome the team, but it hasn't closed yet. We expect to close in that first week of Jan. So as soon as that takes place, just like the Mikros transaction has created so much opportunity for us, so does Hanley. And again, it's in exactly the area that you talked about, and it's all around thermal management. And it's not a surprise to any hyperscalers. It's not a surprise to anyone who has a data center that that's something that they need to address, and they are addressing that. So I do think the 2 transactions will be highly well received.

Ruben Roy
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Well, that's a lot of detail. Mike, I hope this is a quicker follow-up just on the capital equipment. I think you said that was in line with your expectations, maybe a little bit better. Is there any change, I guess, on your sort of thinking around overall spend in the capital equipment market relative to 90 days ago as we think about this year?

Michael Meheryar Dastoor
CEO & Director

So the automated testing equipment side of the business, the back end, I think, has been outperforming. It outperformed last year. It's outperforming this year and will continue to be -- it will outperform the WFE side for sure. I think there's multiple DRAM stacking for high-bandwidth memory that's creating more demand. One good thing we are seeing and it's forward-looking, so we haven't built that into our forecast. But there is some level of WFE improvements coming along as well with the whole AI compute expansion and the NAND factory sort of upgrades. So WFE, think of that more as an opportunity. In the past, we were like, hey, WFE is going to be steady and static. We are seeing some signs of improvements there. And until that happens, it -- those sort of expectations normally move to the right or to the left. So we haven't included that in our guide, but the WFE side could actually be some level of upside for us.

Our next questions come from the line of Melissa Fairbanks with Raymond James.

Melissa Dailey Fairbanks
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

I wanted to start off by asking about automotive and transport. I see that you maintained the outlook for the full year, down a little bit from last year. Just wondering if the mix of that business or any of kind of the geographical trends have changed. We have heard from some suppliers, Europe suppliers are being a little bit more cautious going into next year. Just wondering what the complexion of that business looks like in the near term.

Michael Meheryar Dastoor
CEO & Director

Sure. So let me start by saying automotive is an area that we continue to be appropriately conservative on. I think we're seeing relatively good performance. I think has it hit a bottom? I do feel like it has, and there will be upside going forward on automotive? Is it a '26 event or a '27, '28 event? We just don't know the exact timing. So we're being appropriately conservative from an automotive standpoint. One of the things the team has done really well is invest in powertrain agnostic technologies. And what do we mean by that is software-defined vehicles, it's ADAS, those sort of programs go into any platform, whether it's hybrid or EVs or combustion engines. They're all -- we're talking to all sorts of companies.

And then if you factor in the whole Tier 1 sort of the OEMs still want to own the design and the IP as they wanted to with the EV platforms. That's a good opportunity for us EMS companies as well. And I think those program wins, we do expect we're in discussion again for '27-'28. And we're doing really well because there's a shift in the way that the whole automotive space is working out and not just for EVs, it's now being extended to hybrids and ICE as well or at least the concept is. So we continue to add some capabilities. And I do think '26 -- the best way to define '26 is a conservative year and '27, we could see some upside. Don't forget a program in automotive takes 12 to 18 months to win. So programs we're winning today will only show up in '27-'28.

Melissa Dailey Fairbanks
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. Tell Steve, keep up the good work. Maybe just a quick follow-up. Everyone has to ask about at least one question on data center. As you're ramping your second hyperscale customer, I know your lead hyperscale customer, a lot of that business goes through consignment. Just wondering how much, if any, of some of these new programs that you're ramping are on consignment and maybe gross revenue is actually coming in a little bit better than even what we're seeing on the net revenue side?

Michael Meheryar Dastoor
CEO & Director

I think it's a little bit of a mix. I think the consignment model is more our largest customer perspective. Some of the other customers we're still going through gross versus consignment discussions. But at this stage, we're just factoring in gross levels. I do think that's more likely than consignment models popping up everywhere. I think that was more -- that was specifically for that first hyperscaler. Will it apply across every single hyperscaler? I'm not sure. I think it's a wait-and-see approach.

Melissa Dailey Fairbanks
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. Congratulations.

Our next questions come from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.

Mark Delaney
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Jabil took up its view for AI growth this year to 35%. I realize you already spoke on your own capacity planning. But can you speak to any constraints your data center customers may face from the supply side, including having enough power supply to their data center sites? And to what extent you factored any constraints they may be seeing into your guidance?

Michael Meheryar Dastoor
CEO & Director

Look, our power sort of constrain in the data centers is not a new thing. I think it's always been around. And we've grown, I think -- I can't remember the exact numbers from '24 to '25, we grew exponentially. '25 to '26, again, we're growing at 35%. And this is all while data center power issues continue to perforate. I think overall, like I said, the offering that we have, the solutions that we have, the design engineering and including some level of liquid cooling across our offerings, be it on the chip, be it on the rack servers, be it on the networking switches, be it in the data center infrastructure itself, we're actually engaged with customers to address a lot of those heat questions. So I'm not seeing any major impact of slowdown. Like I said earlier, it's actually -- I've never seen such a healthy pipeline before. It is strong, and it continues to be strong. And I know people talk about AI bubbles, we're not seeing any of that at all.

Mark Delaney
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Very helpful. Mike, last quarter, you mentioned the possibility of winning a third hyperscale customer and you spoke to that possibility again on the call today. Can you give more color on that, including what types of product or products you're hoping to sell to that CSP? And when do you think you may know if you've converted on that opportunity?

Michael Meheryar Dastoor
CEO & Director

We continue to have discussions, Mark. It's a little premature to talk about the products and the revenue. I think that was more a -- the last call was more of a, hey, this is our overall strategy. We're not just targeting 1 hyperscaler or 2 hyperscalers, it's -- there's definitely a third hyperscaler and a fourth hyperscaler if so needed. Our offering, it's that design and engineering architecture capability that's driving a whole bunch of hyperscalers to us. And in a weird way, the discussion could start about a server and a rack and suddenly before you know it, it's moved into liquid cooling, it's suddenly moved into silicon photonics. It's moved into other parts of our data center infrastructure piece with heat exchangers and some of the liquid cooling solutions that we're providing. So it's the offering that we have today that is driving hyperscalers to have these discussions with us. And like I said, it's not built into any of the numbers. We're not talking about our third hyperscaler yet in any of the numbers. But I think going forward, we'll be -- we're still in current -- in discussions currently.

Our next questions come from the line of Tim Long with Barclays.

Timothy Long
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Two, if I could, as well. First, I was hoping you could touch a little bit on that the larger hyperscale customer. It wasn't really cited as a part of the strength here. So curious what kind of trends are going on there. I do think there's some product transitions in some of their compute platforms. So curious if that's impacting or if there's anything else going on there? And then secondly, just more broadly, a lot of movement around custom ASICs and XPUs. Curious how you see Jabil participating. Obviously, CPU gaining a lot of traction and announcements at least over the last few months. How do you see Jabil playing in this whole XPU directly and related type of equipment?

Michael Meheryar Dastoor
CEO & Director

So when we talked about the whole retrofitting piece in -- on the September call, we were specific on one site only. Like I said, the rest of the new business is coming in all the different sites. The retrofitting is ahead of schedule. I do feel our second half will be stronger in terms of getting it ready. I think originally, we had anticipated the retrofit out to be a combination of Q2 and Q3. That might come in earlier in Q3, which should give us some level of upside there. The demand is there. The -- it's crazy what we're seeing in terms of demand so I have no concerns about the demand side. What was your -- the second question?

Timothy Long
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Just on XPUs and custom ASICs and the play directly into that product and peripheral, what it means for the rest of the rack and Jabil's participation?

Michael Meheryar Dastoor
CEO & Director

Yes. So I think we're relatively agnostic in terms of chips, in terms of what we're doing and who we're doing it with. The custom chips, we're working with multiple individual companies on those chips. I don't think one replaces another. It's all complementary in my view. So I see it more as an upside than a replacement.

Our next questions come from the line of David Vogt with UBS.

David Vogt
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So Mike, maybe one for you and one for Greg. So you talked about strength in data center infrastructure, powered networking. We're folding Hanley into the numbers. We're seeing strength in the second hyperscaler above expectations. I guess what I'm trying to think through is how do you think about the second half of your fiscal year, particularly given what the growth implies, a fairly meaningful deceleration where the underlying demand probably doesn't support that view. Is that just a rev rec issue, is it a capacity issue?

How should investors think about sort of the second half of the year, which kind of implies like a 10% growth dynamic? Is there enough capacity? And then maybe, Greg, I'll give you my question as well. Obviously, you took up the full year numbers for revenue, margin and EPS and left kind of the free cash flow outlook unchanged. I recognize that CapEx is probably going to go up, I don't know, $50 million to $100 million year-over-year. Anything else from a working capital perspective or a timing perspective that impacts free cash flow this year versus your original expectations?

Michael Meheryar Dastoor
CEO & Director

So on the second half piece, I think with the $900 million that we've sort of added, a large part of that comes through in Q3 and Q4. Q2, I think we've taken that up by $300 million or $400 million from our previous sort of indications. The retrofitting obviously had a little bit of impact on the Q2. We're continuing to win share. I think if you look at last year, the comps from last year are a little difficult to sort of match up with. We went from 0 to 60 literally in a matter of a few seconds there, where Q3, Q4 saw solid performance from the previous Q1, Q2, where we didn't have some of the additional facilities that we took over from a competitor.

So I would I would caution against doing comps for Q3 and Q4 because that was a huge growth number in Q3 and Q4, which was going from nothing to multiple buildings in that facility. I feel -- look, I think there's no rev rec. There's no other issues going on here. We're being conservative. And I do think second half now reflects a much better picture than it did 90 days ago. And I think it will continue to evolve through the year. We have a tendency of being conservative, appropriately conservative. So second half, I think, bears some good upside for us as well.

David Vogt
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Great.

Gregory Hebard
Chief Financial Officer

David, it's Greg. So on your free cash flow question, yes, still sticking to our guidance of $1.3 billion plus for the year. Again, a real strong Q1 with $272 million. You're absolutely correct. We do see CapEx slightly ticking up, but still staying in our range. And we also do see working capital with the growth we're seeing in the back half of the year, slightly going up as well. So what I'd say is our guide is -- we feel is prudent at this time, and we'll continue to update as we go through the year.

David Vogt
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
