[Operator Instructions] One moment while we poll for questions. Our first question is from Thomas Forte with Maxim Group.

Thomas Forte
Maxim Group LLC, Research Division

So one question, one follow-up for me, and best of luck in navigating a challenging environment. On the Loved by Lovesac recommerce efforts, can you talk about what is the discount to the consumer? So how much are they able to save versus buying the product brand new? And then what's the gross margin to Lovesac on the recommerce sale?

Mary Fox
President & COO

Tom, thank you for the question. So yes, so Loved by Lovesac, the way we're price positioning, it's around about a 20% to 25% discount level to what you'd typically be able to receive if you were buying at full price or at a discount level. We have 2 grades for Loved by Lovesac, so it is basically practically new and then good in terms of the conditions. So there are two different tiers in terms of the pricing. And I think for us, as we're kind of rolling it out, we're now in 27 states, and we're really starting to see the interest build as customers obviously know that our product lasts for a lifetime. I think the second piece that we're excited about is obviously rolling out this half in terms of being able to resale was really just building the processes so that we can unlock trade-in next year because we believe that will be incredibly powerful as people want to change covers, buy into some of the new innovations such as recliner and so forth. So I look forward to sharing more of that from next year.

Keith Siegner
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Just to add one thing. This year has largely been about building the infrastructure and capabilities to get the program to a broad base of folks and to test all of the elements of it for proper functionality. Now that we're in 27 states with a few more still to come, but with the lessons, we'll be able to really lean into this effort and expand it. We've got some other things we're considering to drive this piece of our business even further and put ourselves into a great position to move meaningful volumes through this, especially right ahead of us launching the trade-in program to boot.

Our next question is from Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson.

Michael Baker
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

I think Tom didn’t get to ask this follow-up. But anyway, I will -- let me ask for -- I know you're not giving guidance for next year, but a lot of changes for fiscal 2027 versus what we were previously thinking. You're pushing out the launch of the new room, you're cutting back on showrooms, but you're launching a new sofa. It sounds like you're going to be a little bit more promotional. Can you just help us with some of the P&L impacts we should expect next year in terms of how that all impacts sales, costs, margins, et cetera, more domestic manufacturing. Again, a lot of changes for next year. Give us some help, please.

Keith Siegner
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

So I'll kick this off, and then I'll pass it over to Shawn to talk a little more qualitatively. Look, Mike, very fair questions. We're really in the midst of landing the fourth quarter and ending up this fiscal year and in the process of our formal AOP planning for fiscal '27 at this point. Give us a couple of months, and we'll give you a lot more details. Like Shawn and Mary both mentioned earlier, we're very pleased with the initial progress that what we've seen from these adjustments that we've seen in the fourth quarter, but we need a little bit more time.

Shawn will get into some of the qualitative stuff, but the key principle, I think, to this is we believe that during a protracted period of uncertainty in the macro by focusing on harvesting the brand, we can make more money off of the existing infrastructure and products that we have and launching new products that are quick to market and less costly to launch given their proximity to our existing state. That seems to be the more prudent way for us. And also, like Shawn said, it gives us even more time to transition into a big splash for the new room launching in early calendar '27 in a material way so that drives awareness and appreciation right off the bat for that. But Shawn, what else do you have to add?

Shawn Nelson
Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. Thank you. Given some of the success we've been seeing with Snugg and the brand refresh as our marketing team is really getting their feet beneath them with a lot of the change that we've been living over the past few months and really seeing green shoots from, we see a path to just build a more robust financial situation and cash position leading up to the launch of that new room, which is the kind of position we want to be in when we're really going to swing the bat hard and launch with great gusto. So it's really just a shift of a few months in practicality and this new sectional sofa platform that we are so excited to reveal, maybe the next time we speak is something that will fill a hole -- a different hole in our offering than Snugg has already begun to fill with its introduction, and there's more to come on the Snugg platform as well.

So just, as Keith said, a way to build more profitability and strength in our core business as we prepare for that new launch. And we're actually really grateful to see the results from Snugg and also the marketing engine that’s been performing quite well over the last little bit with some new tactics that gives us a lot of confidence that this is the right strategy for the business in the near- to medium-term.

Michael Baker
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Fair enough. If I could ask a follow-up. I understand the desire to be prudent for the fourth quarter outlook, but the industry seems like it's better than it was. You're seeing a lot of momentum, strong Black Friday, et cetera. I get that there's more difficult comparisons, but you knew that. So why the lower fourth quarter outlook today than what was implied in your guidance that you gave 3 months ago again, if the industry seems to be getting better and you have some momentum. Is it that the industry improvement isn't as -- it's better, but not quite what you thought it would be? Just trying to square that circle.

Shawn Nelson
Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. So the industry has lots of different nodes and certainly, some would say it's getting a little bit better. But at the high end, which is really where we compete, it's worse than the industry on balance. And so it's choppy, it's messy but -- and look, we did have a very strong Black Friday through Cyber Monday, record Cyber Monday for us. It's an abundance of caution. We have tough compares coming over the new year. Back to the industry, for November, it was down 3%, but the high end was down 11%, just to make that real for you, right? So that's the backdrop we're operating in.

And out of an abundance of caution, knowing that there's some tough compares, particularly through New Year, we just want to be prudent. We certainly -- we recognize like very slight miss on the quarter, and that's beyond frustrating for a team that prides themselves on performing and meeting expectations. So that's what it's about for us right now.

Our next question is from Eric Des Lauriers with Craig-Hallum Capital Group.

Eric Des Lauriers
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

First, I was wondering if you could just provide a bit more color on where the revenue weakness in the quarter was coming from. You mentioned weakness in items under $6,000. Just wondering if you could add a bit more color to that. Is that mostly Sacs or smaller components of the Sactionals? And should this have sort of naturally a greater impact on Internet sales versus showroom? Can you just provide a bit more color on sort of where the revenue weakness is coming from, that would be helpful.

Mary Fox
President & COO

Eric, thank you for the question. Yes. So we're seeing definitely, I think Shawn referenced earlier the adjustments we made coming out of Q3 into Q4. So seeing all a big step-up of improvement in the lower-end transaction sizes, which is primarily the small setup Sactionals. So big step-up from obviously the decline and the challenge that we faced in quarter 3. I think the second piece is we are continuing to see at the high end, just this premiumization that really is driving a higher AOV. So they're buying more recliners, more add-ons in terms of storage and even more premium in terms of fabrics as well.

And then I think the last piece, and I think I touched on it earlier, Heidi has been leading a lot of transformation in the marketing team, including putting new leaders in place and in two areas. One is around on the website, and they've been doing a huge amount of work, really overhauling the configuration experience to really be able to drive much better excitement around the holiday gift guide and the web is performing at a much higher growth rate to the total company in quarter 4. So you're seeing a lot of that benefit that's coming through.

And then I think Shawn talked about some of the new innovations, whether it be PillowSac Jr., Accent Chair and the Swept Arm and various other things, that's also helping to bring some more energy to our growth. So we're going to continue to be able to drive our platforms with the innovation and the excitement, brought in some great new covers, for example, and the colors that are new are on fire. So as we continue to drive that excitement and then obviously get the website really to be able to acquire customers at a faster rate because it is our most efficient store. That's really what we've seen the strength through December for this quarter.

Eric Des Lauriers
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

All right. That's helpful. I appreciate that color. And then just a follow-on for me. When you look at the marketing overhaul here, could you just kind of give us a sense of how long you sort of expect this to take? How long you expect to sort of wait to see the impacts of this? Presumably, you're already seeing some impacts on digital, but just wondering what other time lines you're thinking about and we should be thinking about as it relates to this marketing shift and the ultimate success rate?

Mary Fox
President & COO

Yes, thank you, Eric. I think in two parts. I think first is real time and near time. It's happening right now. So as we talked in terms of shifting out of traditional media formats even more aggressively than ever before, such as linear TV, moving a lot more to heavier paid influencers. We did a lot of that towards the end of quarter 3 into quarter 4, a lot more around programmatic digital channels. That's all real time. That's happening right now, and we contribute the quarter 4 performance to obviously a lot of those shifts. So that's really been happening real time.

Then in addition, as I touched on the website performance, that really was turning in a matter of hours and days as the team kind of pivoted and made some of those adjustments. So that is all kind of in Q4. I think the second horizon, as Shawn has talked about the brand evolution and really how do we bring the brand to life in terms of the storytelling about the value, the versatility of the brand and then how do you drop down into the platforms. You're going to continue to see more from Heidi and the team as we get into quarter 1 and quarter 2 next year as we really bolster up that storytelling and really claim the territory that is uniquely Lovesac that no one else has. So you're just going to continue to see us driving all of those opportunities. And then I think, Shawn, maybe you want to touch about our focus on winning in the living room and particularly Snugg's performance in -- on e-commerce, which has been super strong.

Shawn Nelson
Founder, CEO & Director

Yes, no doubt. As we've referenced, we think of ourselves as having these two superpowers, Designed for Life products paired with tailored customer acquisition engines. And on the Designed for Life product side, the Snugg is becoming a really important part of our portfolio. We think there -- while it is still ramping, we believe that it will, as the platform evolves even over this coming year, help us fill in some of that weakness that we're seeing at the below $6,000 transaction realm. So even though we're calling out this weakness at the low end, simultaneous Snugg is ramping.

But like any new product, it just takes time. And so we're really pleased with the results we're seeing. It tells us that the Lovesac customer wants products from Lovesac. It's not just the specific attributes of Sactionals, and that's led us to yet another innovation in the sofa sectional realm that we think, again, will help us fill in the assortment and compete more fully against those incumbents who many of them have dozens and dozens of sofa sectional lines. So while we have no intention of going that broadly, we are starting to really understand the opportunities we have in that realm.

On the marketing side, as Mary said, we're seeing just some really exciting performance in -- on new tactics that we have not exploited before. We had a marketing playbook on these -- speaking of these customer acquisition engines that got us to where we are. And it's certainly -- and we're certainly grateful to have experienced all the growth that we've experienced over this last decade. But needless to say, the world has evolved a ton. Our new CMO is more than capable. And so those were two realms that we're focused on. Those two superpowers will continue to drive the business, but it's a time of great innovation at Lovesac, both on the product side and on the marketing side.

And thankfully, we're seeing those green shoots in the business. And I think it was evidenced by our performance over Black Friday and Cyber Monday. So it's a mixed bag at this very moment given the macro, but we'll continue to look forward to a really exciting year at Lovesac. Next year will be, by far, the most prolific year of innovation launches ever. And we're excited about it.

Our next question is from Matt Koranda with ROTH Capital Partners.

Matt Koranda
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

Just wanted to make sure I understood the cadence of demand during the quarter and then into the fourth quarter here. So maybe just at what point in the third quarter did demand get worse? It sounded like the middle point of the quarter. Were there any regions where you saw concentrated weakness? And then the drivers of improvement into the fourth quarter, it sounds like promotions and sharper on marketing, but maybe just correct me if I'm wrong there. And then, are comps actually positive quarter-to-date? I just want to make sure that -- I mean, I'm getting the sense that, I guess, Black Friday and Cyber Monday were strong, but is the full quarter-to-date comp positive quarter-to-date here?

Mary Fox
President & COO

Matt, thank you for the question. Let me start with the second one, and then I'll come to kind of the cadence in Q3. So yes, the comps are positive for this quarter, and we actually had a strong start to the quarter that has continued all the way through to today, so I feel very good as we've all shared in terms of the adjustments that were made in driving the performance in quarter 4. Then to your question kind of going back to quarter 3, we had -- we've shared with you Labor Day was good. And then coming out of Labor Day, we've really started to see that pressure. We've obviously taken the second price increase, and that really impacted the smaller sized orders at under $6,000.

And at the same time, customers are facing uncertainty kind of more broadly, and we really saw that shift down with that impact. I think then as we saw that drop down, we then made some adjustments. So it's -- our cadence started to improve towards the end of quarter 3, but obviously not enough to be able to make up that loss in the middle part of the quarter. To your question, did we see any impact regionally? We see a little bit more of a challenging performance in a few states such as Florida and Texas. But honestly, it really is more broadly nationally as we look across the whole place, I think. So then as we moved into quarter 4, the adjustments we made both in terms of promo cadence, we simplified, we were bolder, but clearer, but instead of having kind of some of the more discrete personalized offers, we just went full throttle with a winning promotion.

And you know there were many other companies that are promoting up to 80% off, so we knew we needed to be strong. We wanted to win, and we did win based on the November results that just came out yesterday from Bank of America. And then the second point to your -- what else shifted was just the optimization of the media strategy, trying to really focus also on that middle-income consumer to be able to get them to convert. And again, just pleased to see the step-up of that $6,000 and under order performance really move back up from where we were in quarter 3.

Matt Koranda
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

And then on the gross margin outlook, I guess, what's driving the softer outlook in the fourth quarter that's implied here? Is that incremental pressure from the promotions that you're needing to run to induce conversion? What's the tariff pressure also that's factored into the end of the year here?

Keith Siegner
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, Matt, it's actually quite straightforward versus our prior expectations. It's the incremental need for a step-up in promotions to remain competitive, particularly as we target that below $6,000 transaction as well as some deleverage against fixed costs like warehousing and things like that, given the lower absolute level of sales. That really is the difference between our prior expectations. Hopefully, that's helpful.

Our next question is from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer & Co.

Brian Nagel
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

The first question I want to ask just with regard to the reshoring comments. I know, Shawn, we've talked about this for a while now, the plans for Lovesac to bring more manufacturing back to the United States. And seem the conversation suggests that it's happening and happening aggressively. So the question I want to ask is if we think about the model for Lovesac and the comments suggest it should be kind of neutral-ish to, I guess, gross margins or gross profits. But I mean how should -- what would be the longer-term benefits to the Lovesac model of bringing manufacturing back in the U.S.?

Shawn Nelson
Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. Great question. Thank you. To be honest, this is the initiative that perhaps we're most excited about. We believed for a long time that the unique nature of our products and the demand that we've created, we're doing better than $600 million a year in seats and sides. Those should be manufactured more automatedly, closer to the consumer, shipped over shorter distances, both for efficiency and to drive sustainability, which we're passionate about. We're making that real this summer.

And it's been a long project, a difficult project. It's required heavy engineering, reengineering of product from a materials standpoint. So the long-term benefits are myriad. Yes, when we say neutral, we're targeting Sactionals cost. We're targeting -- we're trying to beat -- at least meet, but even beat Sactionals costs on an apples-to-apples basis pre-tariff is our goal. Now we won't promise that at this moment, but that is our internal mandate. And I think we're going to get there.

So the long-term benefit is more stable pricing, better product, again, more efficient supply chain, shipping over shorter distances, more reliable, not subject to everything from pirates to hurricanes to shipping container space, what have you, particularly in the -- over this past decade since the tariffs began to throw everything up in the air in 2018, which is the better part of the decade now. It's been an extremely volatile international landscape. And rather than wait to be kicked out of the nest again, we're completely out of China at this point pretty much, and we took that note pretty early compared to some. But rather than play this hopscotch game around the globe, this is the path that we've taken. And thankfully, it's working out. Like we have line of sight to this being successful.

Finally, so from a gross margin standpoint, this will have ideally a positive impact on our P&L. But then there's the warehousing and inventory carry impact as well, you can only imagine. We know -- right at this moment, there are probably 400 containers of Sactionals or what have you, maybe [indiscernible] it's a ridiculous amount of product between work in progress on the water and then, of course, in our warehouse, that can be mitigated tremendously by manufacturing onshore, again, using these new materials.

And then finally, the Sactionals themselves are going to improve, like this is not hyperbole. This will be a better product made in a more robust way that will have some new features that they will be completely groundbreaking in the world of sofa sectionals, one of one, and they are fundamental improvements that no one in this industry has ever solved or even conceived of solving, and our platform is going to make that possible. And I can't reveal what that is yet, but we think it's a big deal. We think it will make us way more competitive, let alone have these positive impacts on our P&L, our operations in the year. So we're just super proud of the whole team that's made this happen. And intellectual property, we've got some new patent work coming off of it as well, so this is the most exciting thing happening at Lovesac, in my opinion.

Our final question is a follow-up from Thomas Forte with Maxim Group.

Thomas Forte
Maxim Group LLC, Research Division

Can you talk about your gross margin strategy on entering new rooms, meaning the new products should be comparable to products to date from a gross margin standpoint or there may be a situation where you promote heavily initially or any other reason why the initial gross margin would be lower than ramp over time?

Mary Fox
President & COO

Yes. I think, Tom, thank you for the question. So our target, everything that we've been working internally is that we do want to maintain the gross margins that we've been proud to achieve as we enter into the new room. So the team have been very hard at work. We've been looking at a lot of product and reviewing and challenging both in terms of the customer attributes, but also the manufacturing efficiencies, leaning in, in terms of also production in the U.S., which also will obviously give us some benefits.

So for us, we see this as being able to maintain the gross margin levels that we've seen. And actually, Shawn talked about the excitement as we think about reimagining the inserts, there is going to be so much benefit in the new room in terms of just having that domestic product being manufactured, getting it to customers even quicker and managing our inventory, let alone just the awesome product that we are getting to see with the teams. But Shawn, I don't know anything else you want to add on the new room?

Shawn Nelson
Founder, CEO & Director

Look, our goal is to continue to target these high 50s gross margins. You've seen us fluctuate over the past number of years that you've been tracking us between -- really always between 55% and 60%. So that's the place we think this business should be at. It puts us definitely at the high end in our industry. Of course, we -- speaking really candidly, we don't believe that going much higher than that is prudent for this category. It leaves us further open to competition, copycats who knows leaving too much meat on that bone, right? So it's a delicate balance, but our point of view has not changed and the new room doesn't change it for us.

And look, we expect to compete at the higher end of things with very practical product that can do all the things that you have grown to expect -- that consumers have grown to expect from Lovesac and perform the same way from a quality standpoint, features and adaptability standpoint, everything Designed for Life represents. But great question. And of course, we're super excited to get there, but we just have so much opportunity in this coming year to lean into the core and the strength that this brand already has and really harvest some of that value.

Look, we are the most prolific advertiser of couches on the planet, delivering the best, most versatile couches on the planet. That's what we're known for. And so this is a really, we think, safe approach to the coming year in this choppy environment while giving us opportunities to drive revenue, drive growth and protect that gross margin. And so that's the foundation we want to be on when we launch that new room. That's what all of this is about.

Operator

This will end our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Shawn for closing remarks.

Shawn Nelson
Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. Thank you so much to all of those investors, shareholders, stakeholders who supported Lovesac and of course, to our tireless Lovesac team, who continues to fight through this crazy macro environment to deliver great results, we're looking forward to the coming year.

Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.
