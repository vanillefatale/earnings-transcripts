[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.

Steven Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

So subsequent to your Investor Day, I think Google announced the acquisition of Intersect, the renewables developer. So I'm curious kind of how does that fit in with how you're thinking about your partnership with Google? And if we do see other hyperscalers acquire developers, kind of how do you think that -- about that as a competitive risk? Or how are you just thinking about that if that becomes a thematic?

John Ketchum
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes, Steve, it's John. Thank you for the question. And first of all, the short answer is, it has no impact on our partnership. Google called us in advance of the announcement and said as much to us. And here's why. I mean, we have a lot of respect for Intersect but they're a smaller developer. They're really concentrated in 2 states, California and ERCOT. And when you buy into a smaller developer, you're buying into their existing position. And you've really got to think through what that existing position comes with. Where are they on safe harbor, right? Those deadlines have already passed for tax credits.

So you're stuck with whatever safe harbor position that they have. A smaller developer is always are going to have a small safe harbor position just given the obvious limitations, [indiscernible], right, is another safe harbor where the deadline has passed as well. We are in outstanding position in both of those areas and have a ton of flexibility to add a lot of generation. You're also kind of stuck with their inventory. Where are their permitted sites? We have permitted sites across the United States. We have 1.5x coverage on those sites. You're also kind of stuck with their supply chain position and their relationships. Have they -- remember, there's long lead time equipment that has to be secured. So if you weren't planning on an acquisition, you probably didn't have a lot of inventory to start with to go engage in a large build. And so I think that's certainly a limiting factor.

We've been very vocal. I know we've been out buying equipment for -- across the energy value chain, secured our solar and storage inventory through 2029. I don't think a lot many small developers can say that. And then experience across technologies, you got to really find somebody that knows all 50 states, that can do business in 50 states, understands the ISOs in and out, working with FERC, working with Washington and experience across wind and solar and storage and transmission, whether it's electric or gas, all of those things are -- nuclear and gas-fired generation, it's very rare and unusual and unique the position that NextEra is in.

And so I think when you put all those factors together, addressing your other question, the competitive risk, I just don't see it. We are in a period of significant power demand, needing to put electrons on the grid. We have great sites. We have 20 data center hubs on the -- that we're developing currently, trying to expand that to 40. Small developers just don't have that. And so we're in a great spot and I couldn't be less concerned.

Steven Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Understood. One other question, just on -- we've seen a little more noise just on kind of data center fighting opposition or concerns about causing rates to go up and including some, I think, in Florida. Just could you maybe just talk to how you're feeling about that overall but maybe specific in your Florida plan?

John Ketchum
President, CEO & Chairman

Sure. I'll turn that over to Scott Bores to address the Florida question and then I'll come back and talk about the nat, what we're seeing on the national level.

Scott Bores
President

Steve, it's Scott. In Florida, right now, we are in legislative session. There are 2 pieces of legislation out there, 1 by the house, 1 by the Senate. The Senate is the one that's advanced through already through a committee and I will say, is the more constructive legislation. What that is really pushing for is, I'll say, a lot of what our tariff already does, providing protection to the general body of customers. And so we are going to continue to support that legislation as it advances. And I think ultimately, that is going to allow us to continue to move our tariff forward and hopefully continue to get some customers signed up and move that forward. But nothing we're concerned about in Florida.

John Ketchum
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. When I look at things nationally, that's what's so beneficial about what NextEra Energy brings to the table, right? One, we have a national footprint. Two, we have the ability to really help our customers design affordable and reliable solutions, given what we can bring to the table across the energy value chain, we really can help them actually come up with a solution that really threads the needle around affordability but also bringing the necessary electrons that are required to create that job creation, create that property tax base.

And like I said in my prepared remarks, I mean, we really see this heading more towards Bring Your Own Generation. And I think that's how we've set up our entire pipeline and our development effort. And we are one of the very few companies that are out there building and if investors are looking for a way to get exposure to a builder, I think we're the perfect answer for that. And I think that's where Washington is heading. I think that's where the various ISOs are heading because it's going to be really important that the hyperscaler shoulder the cost associated with the incremental generation that has to be built to power the data center. And I think we're the perfect partner to do that given the relationships that we have, given our ability to do things on a -- at a much lower cost than our competition. And so feel good about where things stand outside of Florida as well for those reasons.

The next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Maybe pick it up where Steve left off here. I mean, look, I'd love to hear a little bit about how you think and what's the expectations on the cadence of announcements to hit these targets, whether the 15 or 30 gigawatts? And specifically, what does success in 2026 look like in order to ensure you're tracking against those 15 plus or what have you? And then within that, John, how do you think about the kind of resource mix? Like is 15, what's the composition of gas versus renewables, et cetera, et cetera, if you can? And then maybe a subpart to that, to tie back to what Steve said, how would you set milestones or expectations in FPL specifically? I know you guys talked about the 2028 starting time line on data centers. Is that coming sooner or later relative to the newer efforts on the hubs?

John Ketchum
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Let me go ahead and take those in order, Julien. So first of all, let's just talk about the development expectations that we laid out at the investor conference. As I've said before, they're not heroic, right? I mean they're basically -- as long as we can do through 2032, what we've done over the last 10 or 20 years, we're going to be in great shape, right? I mean we're counting on market share that is very consistent with what we've been able to achieve over the last 1 to 2 decades. In renewables, it's about 15% to 20% in storage, it's about 20% to 30%. And in gas, through 2032, it's only 5% to 10% market share. So we feel very good, first of all, with the base forecast.

Second, when you mentioned the 15 by 35, one of the things that I want to make really clear is that 15 by 35 is just an origination channel, right? That's a program that we have on the origination side to hit those very reasonable, very realistic development expectation. It's one of many ways to get there. And when you unpack that 15 to 35 gigawatts (sic) [ 15 by 35 ], the composition of it is, roughly 6 gigawatts of gas-fired generation by 2035. And it's going COD by 2035 to hit that. And it's a mix of renewables and storage for the balance. So we feel good about where we stand. We hope to be able to do a little bit better than that.

Actually, let me make one clarification. That's 6 gigawatts of gas by 2032, I said 2035 -- by 2032. And second, let me talk about the milestones for Florida real quick and then we'll turn things over to Armando to add some points on Florida. For FPL, we feel really good about where things stand. Right now, we have 20 gigawatts of interest in Florida. And we have advanced discussions with customers on roughly 9 gigawatts, for all the reasons that I had in my prepared remarks. Florida is a terrific data center opportunity for the right partner. I think folks see that. And they realize the benefits and the growth that we're going to be seeing in Florida, the fiber latency issues, the need to be close to where business is developing in South Florida, all the development that we're seeing across the state.

But second, what's really attractive and what's really appealing, I think, for hyperscalers is, look, we have a really -- we have a low bill. We know how to get things done. We have a long track record of being able to work with the state at all levels. And -- but most importantly, from a customer standpoint, we have a large load tariff that makes sure that the hyperscaler is paying the cost of the additional build, not the customers in Florida.

Armando, do you have anything you'd like to add?

Armando Pimentel
Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company

Yes. Just real quick, Julien. So John had in the prepared remarks, a sentence that said 2025 was about laying the groundwork and 2026 is about execution. That applies to both companies and certainly to FPL. To answer your question as specific as I can, my expectations is that in 2026 that there will be announcements regarding large load in our service territory. That's certainly what we are shooting for and working for. And that's what 2026 for us is all about.

Unknown Executive

And Julien, just on the question around what does 2026 look for -- like for us for success. I'd just go back to 13 -- comment about -- 13 is our expectations. This is our kind of road map that we're going to track against from the standpoint of where do we think we'll be developing. And so this is -- the channel feeds into this, as John mentioned. So we're looking at the expectation of what we're laying out here on Page 13 and continue to track against those.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Awesome. And just as a quick follow-up in terms of disclosures maybe and not to pin you down too much on '26. But how do you think about, say, chunkier announcements, say, with Google here and making specific announcements around that versus the typical quarterly announcement cadence of singles and doubles to kind of "chip away" against that 15-plus gigawatt target on the near side? Should we expect bigger announcements here? Or is this going to be more of a regular quarterly cadence of chipping away?

John Ketchum
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. I mean I'll say 2 things about that, Julien. I mean, first of all, we are -- we have a lot going on as a company, a lot of opportunities, a lot of discussions that we're having with customers that are in various stages. You should not expect us to wait for quarterly calls to announce those things. So as they happen, we will come forward with them on those chunkier deals as you call them.

The next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Wells Fargo.

Shahriar Pourreza
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

John, just in terms of the nuclear recontracting, maybe just an update in Wisconsin since the existing counterparties need to make a resource decision kind of soon. I guess where do we stand on marketing the open capacity? And just given the amount of acreage that's around the site, could we see sort of a behind-the-meter deal structure there? Or should we continue to assume a virtual deal just given the BYOG initiatives, et cetera?

John Ketchum
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. I mean, first of all, on Wisconsin, in Point Beach, I'd say this about all of our nuclear plants. We saw how much interest there was around Duane Arnold. There's a lot of interest around Point Beach. Wisconsin is in a great spot for data center build-out. It's no secret how much interest there's been there, Foxconn and Cloverleaf and some of the other expansion opportunities around the state, very conducive to data center build-out. And so with that comes a lot of interest around power generation solutions. And given the relationships that we have with utilities in the Midwest region and with cooperatives, in the area, you saw the WPPI deal that we announced with 14% of the generation already having been secured, is one example of that. We feel very good about how that asset is positioned. We're going to be careful and methodical about our approach and make sure that we are doing the right thing by our shareholders in terms of what we ultimately do with that asset.

Shahriar Pourreza
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Okay. Appreciate that. And then just on PJM, specifically, a lot of different data points there. But would you participate in the backstop auction there, just either on the renewable or gas side? Is it sort of becoming a little bit more constructive as a solution?

John Ketchum
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. I think, Shar, the way I would answer that is, still a lot to play out, right? And you got to have regulatory certainty before you allocate capital against any investment. And so we would have to have real regulatory certainty around outcomes here in order to drive new investment. And I think that is exactly what the administration is trying to do. And I think that's what the 13 governors that signed on to the recent framework agreement that -- or framework proposal that was announced. But PJM has more work to do in terms of coming up with what exactly they plan for the future of that market.

But certainly, under the right construct, it could be attractive for new generation but you have to have a long-term certainty around what capacity prices are going to be. They have to be at the right level in order to support new investment in that area. And as I look at it, with how we're positioned to ramp BYOG, we have so many opportunities around the United States right now that we are pursuing. But certainly, we have a close keen eye on PJM as well and are watching to see how things play out.

The next question comes from Nicholas Campanella with Barclays.

Nicholas Campanella
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I just wanted to come back to the FPL large load discussion. Just -- I wanted to just understand, you have the tariff framework in place. So what is the kind of gating item more on the customer side? Like what are your customers telling you they're still trying to get done before being able to kind of move forward with an agreement? Is it like water, land permitting, rezoning? I guess just what needs to kind of fall into place to see some announcements here in '26?

Armando Pimentel
Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company

Thanks. So look, customers want to make sure that when they're plopping down the $10 billion or so for all the capital that's needed for one of these that they're in a place that they feel comfortable long term. And while we have a tariff, there is current legislation being discussed up in Tallahassee that may make a difference in terms of water usage, may make a difference in terms of items that the hyperscalers or large load company -- entities can get from local municipalities or from the state and they're waiting to see how that shakes itself out.

Scott answered a question before on what's going on in Tallahassee. We feel quite comfortable that we are going -- we are all going to get to a very constructive outcome in terms of what data centers have to look at in order to do business in Florida. But my expectation is, as I answered the question before, is that in 2026, based on what we are seeing, the interest that we are seeing on the ground here in Florida and particularly in the FPL service territory, that there will be some announcements in 2026. So again, I expect there to be a constructive outcome to the legislation that's being discussed up in Tallahassee. And I also think it's very likely that we will have announcements in 2026 regarding large load in our service territory.

Nicholas Campanella
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great. Sorry, to make you repeat yourself. And then maybe just a quick update on supply chain. I know you have the 4 to 8 gigawatt gas target and you talked about having secured supply for 4 gigs. Just when would you kind of secure the additional 4? And where do you see pricing right now through 2032 and availability?

John Ketchum
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes, Nicholas. So first of all, we have the 4-gig position on gas, which we would put against the opportunity set, mainly those data center hub opportunities that we see and are continuing to advance that I've talked a lot about on this call. From a -- when we secure more, as our discussions continue to advance and we continue to have very good discussions kind of across the board on those 20 gigawatts of data center hubs that we hope to grow to 40 by the end of this year. And we always make prudent decisions around how we manage our supply chain position. I don't worry too much about it in terms of gas turbine availability though. I mean given the relationship, the partnership that we have with GE Vernova, getting our hands on gas turbines at an economic and competitive prices, not the top of my list of things to be concerned about. And so I think that probably also addresses the pricing point. I can't give you specific pricing terms and conditions that we would get or that we would see. But they're -- I would say they're just -- remain consistent with what we told you back in December.

The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.

Jeremy Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just wanted to start off with wind additions, if I could. It looked like a little uptick there. Just wondering if you could frame a bit more what you're seeing? Are there some green shoots that could be developing there?

Unknown Executive

Sure. We had some wind additions that you saw in '28 and '29, if you're looking at the backlog page. And listen, we continue to see balance across our business from the standpoint of opportunities for people who are looking for electrons. And so from a green shoots perspective, I do think we'll continue to see more solar, more storage and then ultimately gas relative to wind. I think that's a trend that continues to move forward. But we still see interest across the various products. We've got a national footprint and national customer base and the need for electrons kind of varies. So we're glad to add them but I think the trend is still going to be more towards solar and battery as we think about those various products.

Jeremy Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Understood. And if I could just pivot towards SMRs. I think we started to see hyperscalers and other, I guess, end users start to adopt, I guess, one technology to run with. And so granted, it's ways off at this point. But just wondering your thoughts on this and whether you might look to partner with one technology here to go for it as everyone tries to go from FOAK to NOAK. And just wondering rough timing in -- around design approval and then construction time lines if you were to go in that direction.

John Ketchum
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Good question. And we've done a lot of work around the OEMs. I think we said back in December, we kind of took the 96 or so folks that -- call them SMR OEMs and culled that down to about 12 and then deep dives on technology, commercial assessment around the balance. And we have a very good feel as to who may make sense to advance discussions with there. But whether or not we partner with one, partnering is not something that we've historically done. We like to create competition amongst our suppliers unless one particular supplier has concentration in a specific area or has a unique technology offering and we can enter into attractive long-term pricing arrangement that creates win-wins. But we're always careful about locking ourselves in with just one -- with one counterparty.

But obviously, for us to advance on SMRs, which is something we are -- we have an SMR team, first of all, I should say. We are taking this very seriously. We have a development -- a part of our development organization that is focused 100% on SMRs. So we're not only looking at development around our existing nuclear sites but we're also looking at greenfield opportunities as well and how an SMR could fill -- fit into a long-term solution around a data center hub as we look to the future. But again, any movement from us on SMRs, I go back to what I said in the prepared remarks, has to be under the right commercial terms and conditions where there's appropriate risk sharing, capping on financial exposure because we're going to be very prudent and careful how we approach that market. But excited about the potential.

You also asked about some of these announcements where you see hyperscalers teaming up with one specific OEM. I'm not sure how much I would read into that. I think really folks are just trying to learn more and see who has viable solutions out there. We'll see which ones actually advance over time but that's what we are keenly focused on. And in any discussion, it's not around SMRs, it's not only with the OEM, it's with the hyperscaler as well. It's with the government, right? I mean it's going to take 4 parties coming together to come up with the right structure that makes sense but it's something we're very focused on.

Unknown Executive

Yes. And then the only thing I'd add, which I know we've said before is, while we are spending a lot of time, it's not in our expected -- that would be upside to our plan, if we were able to put something together. We are spending all that time that John talked about it and it would be upside to our plan. But our base plan doesn't have SMRs in it. And so -- but we do think it could be good upside and we're spending real time on it because I think there's an opportunity that we're excited about.

Jeremy Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Makes sense. One quick last one, if I could. It does seem like the federal government is putting in very significant billions of dollars to support SMR and nuclear development here. Just curious, I think, if there's anything missing or what more could be put in there to get the market going in this direction?

John Ketchum
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. I think -- first of all, I think the administration is doing all the right things. Like you said, I mean, they are really trying to enable American energy dominance across board and excited about many of the programs that they're coming forward with, around nuclear in particular, around SMRs and advanced nuclear. I think that just those programs that they've already established create that -- the opportunity for that 4-way discussion that I just mentioned in a very constructive way that I think could hopefully get one of these projects off and running under the appropriate commercial structure. But more work to do there, right? I mean I think we've made some very good progress in that area. And I think the government is doing the right things. And so up to developers and OEMs and customers to come together to work with the government on the right framework.

The next question comes from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs.

Carly Davenport
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

You had mentioned earlier the PJM recommendation for the transmission project with Exelon. I guess there's been some degree of pushback in Pennsylvania on that project given the cost and some of the shifts on the PJM load forecast. Can you just talk a little bit about that and your confidence in that project moving forward?

Unknown Executive

Sure. Listen, I think our confidence continues to be high. PJM management continues to recommend and we expect them to continue to recommend for the Board and the ultimate Board meeting. We're listening to everyone, all the stakeholders, the OCA as they continue to think about this project. But we think this is important for reliability. It's the lowest-cost answer in the region to achieve that reliability and it continues to be supported by PJM. So we're -- we feel good and continue to feel good and we'll continue to listen to all the stakeholders throughout the process.

Carly Davenport
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Great. And then just on the adjusted EBITDA outlook for '26 at near, if we look at the year-over-year guidance both gas pipes and gas infrastructure, that looks down year-over-year. So just curious, given the asset purchases in that area this year, kind of what drives that decline? And if you see any potential upside, obviously, recognizing that's a smaller piece of the pie today.

Michael Dunne
CFO, Executive VP of Finance, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary

Yes. I think as we've mentioned on the natural gas pipelines, it's going to be an area that we continue to grow over the course of the next decade. If you look at what occurred between 2025 and what we look at for 2026, is simply as you looked at our proportionate ownership share in Explorer, they had a pipeline of [indiscernible] that they divested at Explorer and that brought down that EBITDA. But as we look on a go-forward basis, pipelines will be critical piece of our growth trajectory for 2026 and beyond. And listen, as you look at gas infrastructure, I think the reduction in EBITDA is relatively small, $50-ish million or so. So as you look at that piece, we'll continue to see that have a place in our overall structure but I wouldn't necessarily expect that to be a key piece of our growth trajectory.

At this time, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.
