[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.

Matthew Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So Elliott, you led both in the release and on the call by citing the turnaround is in middle innings. Could you elaborate maybe where you've scored runs so far versus where you have opportunity remaining and just your overall confidence today that you can win the game? And then, Matt, if you could just elaborate on the components of gross margin that you cited. I think you cited underlying expansion, excluding tariffs for the third quarter and just the progression that we should think about moving forward.

Elliott Hill
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Matthew, and appreciate the question. And let me start by saying the path back to sustainable, profitable growth is going to go through our Win Now actions, and that will be -- and they will be accelerated by our sport offense. And I would also say that I'm incredibly inspired by the way our teammates have responded to the actions in the new offense.

The drivers of our growth right now for NIKE, they came through the Win Now actions which were our near-term actions around culture, product, storytelling, the marketplace and winning on the ground with consumers. But it's our sport offense is the accelerator of those actions. It's how we take athlete-centered innovation, and it travels through every country, channel and account to drive growth. And the sport offense is what's bringing the balance to our portfolio. We have a relentless flow of innovative product now coming across our 3 brands through multiple sports, performance and sportswear, men's, women's and kids, and it's -- and we pay it off across 190 countries.

So we've had some meaningful progress, Matthew, over the last 90 days. NIKE brand is growing. Sport is growing with Running leading the effort there at up over 20% and taking market share. We're beginning to diversify the portfolio, rightsizing our classics. As Matt said, we declined roughly $4 billion from its peak. North America grew 9%. Wholesale grew. Our order book for the spring and summer is up. So we have a healthier base from which to grow profitable, sustainable growth.

So in terms of middle innings specifically, I think the best way to think about it is that we have our businesses -- the dimensions of our businesses moving at different speeds and the time lines are going to vary by geo, channel and sport dimension. So by brand, as an example, Nike is off to a strong start. We had growth this quarter. Jordan, I think, still has some room to dimensionalize beyond Streetwear into things like Jordan Basketball, Jordan Training, et cetera, but we've seen some real good progress around Streetwear there. We're resetting the marketplace for Converse under new leadership.

In terms of product, performance is growing, but sportswear is still in the early stages of diversification. We've done a great job of rightsizing the franchises, but we still need to diversify that portfolio, middle innings. And then from a geography, North America is leading, EMEA just transitioned to the sport offense, followed by APLA, which, as Matt pointed out, had some mixed results. And then China has our longest road ahead.

And that's why we're sitting there saying we're in middle innings, great success in North America, work to do in China. And -- but all I would say here, just to sort of close it out, Matthew, is the middle innings, while we keep saying we're in the middle innings, I will say this, the Win Now actions and the sport offense is working, and it will lead us back to profitable, sustainable growth.

Matthew Friend
Executive VP & CFO

And Matt, as it relates to margins, I would just say that our business is still in a transition in the middle innings, and we are navigating through both transitory and structural headwinds across the portfolio. But as Elliott said, we've made meaningful progress through the Win Now actions, and you can really see that in the progress that we made in North America in Q2.

North America's gross margins were down 330 basis points, despite more than 500 basis points of a headwind to product costs due to the gross impact from the new tariffs. And so that's a marketplace where we're furthest along in repositioning digital. We're back to growth in wholesale, and we've made the most progress in cleaning up the marketplace. And so as I look ahead to Q3, we guided our margins to be down 175 to 225 basis points. That includes 315 basis points of higher product costs related to new tariffs. And so we expect -- so expansion, excluding the impact of new tariffs, really reflecting the beginning of recovery of the transitory headwinds at the corporate level.

And we continue to expect to see momentum building in North America given where the state of the marketplace is. We're watching promotional activity in Europe, but inventory in Europe is in a healthy place. And then as I mentioned, there's puts and takes across APLA. And we expect the trends in Greater China and Converse for Q3 to be relatively in line with what we saw in Q2 as we continue to take actions on both of those resets. And so I would say that overall, we're encouraged by the momentum and the progress that we're seeing, but we've still got some work to do.

Our next question will come from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.

Irwin Boruchow
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I guess maybe for Elliott, it may be a similar type of question as Matt's, but you've mentioned the recovery won't be linear several times over the past year or in transition, and it totally makes sense. I guess I'd like to know if you're able to share when you believe that maybe that caveat won't be needed anymore and you'll be able to better kind of hold momentum, create better visibility for investors on what's clearly becoming a reset base of revenue and earnings.

Elliott Hill
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thanks, Ike. Here's the best way that I would think about it is each geo -- let's first start with the brands. Each of the brands are at different stages in terms of diversifying their product portfolio. We just got into the sport offense in September, so we got these small cross-functional teams. We're getting them up and running as fast as we can.

Same thing is happening in the countries and key cities around the world. That's happening at different stages. And so that's -- we believe in the strategy, and we know that the path back to profitable sustainable growth is through the Win Now action. We also believe in the sport offense and our ability to create beautiful products and then pay it off in an integrated marketplace.

We just have 3 brands in multiple sports and 4 geos and 190 countries, and they're all operating at different time lines. And so that's the reason why we keep saying that we have different time lines, and it's just going to take time. So I will just sort of point to the place we focus first, which is North America, and we're having great success there. So we're confident in our path forward.

Matthew Friend
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And I just would add, Ike, that we said on North America that we're growing increasingly confident that we can sustain that momentum. I would also say that we've said that we believe we're going to drive modest growth in wholesale this year, starting to have more confidence in that dimensionality of the business.

But what you also heard on the call today was that we took some unplanned actions in Greater China as we're navigating real time through some of the challenges that we see in some of the businesses that are under reset. And so we're going to continue to take it 90 days at a time for now to give ourselves the flexibility to make the right decisions for the long-term health of our brands. And much of what we said today is consistent with what we've been talking about for the past couple quarters.

Our next question will come from the line of Bob Drbul with BTIG.

Robert Drbul
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Just if I could ask 2 questions. I think the first one is on the commitment, sort of the focus on the return to double-digit EBIT margin, it's a big priority for you guys. Is there a time line at which you could talk to when you think you'll get there? And I think the second question, just like part of that, I think, is on China. Long road ahead, Q2 revenues similar, Q3 similar to Q2. How deep a reset do you think is necessary in China? And are we near a bottom in revenue or EBIT declines in China?

Elliott Hill
CEO, President & Director

Okay. So Bob, let me do this. You snuck in 2 questions on me, but here's what I'm going to do. Let's take EBIT first, and then we'll take China because I don't want to confuse the 2. But let me first just say that improving margins continues to be a top priority. And I said it before and I'll continue to say it, we do see a path back to double-digit EBIT margins. Margins are under pressure for 2 reasons. First, the driver of our -- is our Win Now actions and that we've intentionally taken to clean up the marketplaces around the world.

The second is the impact of tariffs where we implement -- which were implemented after we activated the Win Now actions. And we're seeing the benefits of us taking those actions. We've said it North America back to growth, running back to growth, wholesale up, the order book and we have a healthier base for top line growth moving forward. In addition to the top line growth, we also have opportunity to improve the efficiency and productivity in how we operate the business, and we're going to share more in the coming quarters. Matt, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.

Matthew Friend
Executive VP & CFO

I would just say something that will sound familiar. We're clear on what the path back looks like. It starts with growth, and I think that the investments that we've made to drive the Win Now actions are paying fruit. You see it with a second quarter of top line growth and specifically the growth that North America was able to deliver in the quarter, which is where we'd focused our demand creation investments and where we'd focused our investments in our commercial teams in order to be able to get back on the offense in the marketplace.

Part of what's going to drive expansion is recovery of our full-price mix as we continue to manage the off-price, full-price mix in the marketplace. And again, I point to North America where we've now cleaned the inventory in the marketplace, and we're starting to see margin expansion excluding the headwind of tariffs. Another big opportunity for us is to leverage the supply chain costs as we grow. And that's been a meaningful headwind over the last year as our business has reduced in size and growth will help us with that, but there's also a lot of focus and attention on that as well.

And then the last piece of it, I would say, is the work that we're doing to be disciplined in the way we're managing costs across the business. We've been investing in marketing, and we feel good about where we've leveled our brand marketing investment. We've locked in some of our most important team franchises for the long term, which strategically puts us at a great position in the world of sport. But we've been very focused on managing operating overhead, and we will continue to do that, and we look forward to sharing more about that in the upcoming quarters.

Elliott Hill
CEO, President & Director

Okay. I'll jump back now, and I'll take -- let me take China. China continues to be one of the most powerful opportunities in sport. We're confident that the Win Now actions and the sport offense will allow us to continue to invite 1.4 billion consumers into the world of sport, fitness and the lifestyle sport. So we see China as a big opportunity. With that said, it's clear that we need to reset our approach to the China marketplace and it's going to start with structure. The geos are now reporting to me. Angela, who is our GM in Greater China, is now part of my SLT, Senior Leadership Team, and I look forward to working with her and the rest of our team more closely.

Let me share a little bit of diagnosis of where we are. And we believe and firmly believe and will always believe that our growth will come through sport, but the reality is we've become a lifestyle brand competing on price in China. We also reduced the feet on the ground, people on the ground. As you know, it's a mono-brand marketplace with thousands of -- 5,000 doors with the teams working the presentation of our product at retail and we weren't making the investment in our store fleet, so our stores aren't compelling.

And as Matt mentioned, the cycle that it started to feed itself, soft demand leading to consistent promotions and then impacting profitability. And we did signal last quarter because of these structural differences that China would be on a different time line. So we're taking action. We're cleaning up the marketplace of aged product. We're getting back to the basics of retail, consumer right assortments, better storytelling and elevated visual presentation.

We're increasing investments in Shanghai and Beijing, resetting key doors. Matt referenced those in his prepared remarks. We're seeing early success. But I'll say this, it's not happening at the pace we like. So we have more to do. It's going to take a fresh perspective, a new approach, and we will have to come through this with new capabilities as well. And we're working closely with our partners, Pou Sheng and Topsports, to adapt our approach. But I'll just sort of end here. I've done this before, have a deep history in the market. We've diagnosed the problem, and we will return NIKE to a beloved premium and innovative brand in China.

Our next question comes from the line of Aneesha Sherman with Bernstein.

Aneesha Sherman
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Elliott, at the start of 2025, you expressed your strong confidence in the pipeline for Running and you laid out this 3x3 framework that you discussed with partners and we're now seeing strong acceptance in the market and the business is growing over 20%. As you look across the other verticals, I know you talked about new innovation across all of them, but how do you see the phasing of the growth? And are there particular areas where you have that same level of conviction that you had in Running a year ago and where you expect the business to ramp very quickly versus some that are a little slower?

And then a follow-up on North America. Matt and Elliott, you both talked about the contribution of new distribution and same-store sales on the wholesale growth. Are you happy with the mix of partners you have now? Or is the goal to continue to ramp up new distribution points into next fiscal year as well?

Elliott Hill
CEO, President & Director

Aneesha, thanks for the questions. I'll start, let me take the product portfolio piece first. Here's what I'd say. The teams are doing a really nice job of building a more diverse portfolio. You can start to see it in our numbers. We do have an unmatched portfolio with depth and dimension across performance and sportswear, men's, women's kids, footwear, apparel, accessories and up and down price points.

And we believe that moving into this sport-obsessed teams through our sport offense, we're already starting to see the pipeline and the flow of innovation coming through across the 3 brands: Nike, Jordan and Converse. So we know when we focus on sport, we win. You called out Running already. I will hit very quickly that we launched Vomero Premium as part of that 9-box construct that you referenced this quarter and had very good sell-through. And we also launched Structure 26 in our stability silo, and we're launching Structure Plus next month. So we're continuing to fill that out. But it's not just about footwear, it's also about apparel. We have some really strong apparel coming through in Running as well. So we will continue to grow and dimensionalize Running as -- Nike Running as an opportunity.

In terms of other business opportunities, global football, it's probably the furthest along in terms of their construct. We have 3 silos there: footwear silos, the Mercurial, Tiempo which will launch in Q3 and then our Phantom which had a really strong launch in Q1. So 3 silos also connecting deeply with each of the consumers that play a different style of football.

Apparel and footwear also dimensionalizes that opportunity, national team kits, World Cup, really strong read there, 40% up on the order book versus World Cup '22. Training, 24/7 apparel, continuing to diversify the footwear. I see that coming. That's not yet hit, but we feel good about what's coming from training and footwear.

SKIMS had a successful launch. We launched in EMEA and APLA next quarter in basketball. We're dimensionalizing through women's, Sabrina, Asia and now we have Caitlin coming and our men's business continues to do well. Ja sold through extremely well. And then we just launched the G.T. Future, and we had kids lining up for that shoe. So starting to dimensionalize beyond or dimensionalize the portfolio.

And then I could dive into innovation a bit more further out. I think it's getting stronger every season. We're investing significantly in our Nike Sports Research lab, and we're being intentional about connecting that R&D to our sport offense. And we announced a few big. which I talked about product innovations, Nike Mind and then Aero-FIT. So I feel good about the pipeline, and we see the response in our order book which is up for the back half of the year.

Matthew Friend
Executive VP & CFO

Maybe I'll jump in on marketplace, Elliott, and then you can add to it. Aneesha, we feel good about the North America marketplace and our partners. We've got great partnerships. We've been working incredibly close with our partners as we're working to elevate the marketplace and reposition the NIKE brand in a segmented and differentiated way across accounts and across the marketplace.

Tom Petty and the team have just been crushing it in terms of leading us through our Win Now actions. And when I look at the order book for the back half of the year, the order book is very balanced in terms of growth between new partners and existing partners. And so we feel great about the quality of the growth that we see in the back half across a balanced integrated marketplace.

Our teams are always looking for opportunities because our marketplace strategy is a consumer-based strategy. We want to be in the path of the consumer, leveraging our partners across digital and physical owned and partnered. And so I wouldn't rule out the possibility of it, but I wouldn't say that that's what's needed in order for us to be able to sustain the momentum that we see in North America.

Elliott Hill
CEO, President & Director

I was going to add to it, but you've already embraced your new job, right? I think the only thing that I would add to it, Aneesha, because I think Matt did such a nice job is that, again, that Tom and the leadership team have done a really great job of just rightsizing the product, getting the marketing going. And then I would say the thing that's the big difference is setting 3-year visions with each of -- and this is into the details but it matters, setting 3-year visions by account on the consumers that we want to serve by sport and then bringing that back to 1-year plans and then to seasonal plans. And that's how you get back to driving profitable, sustainable growth between -- with the partners. And again, the team's done a really nice job. So leading the way and therein lies the opportunity in the other geos for us. We've got to get the other geos keeping pace, and we're working hard to do just that.

Our next question will come from the line of Jonathan Komp with Baird.

Jonathan Komp
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Maybe one more on China. Do you think the North America experience where, Elliott, we saw maybe 2 or 3 quarters of severe pressures after you came in and accelerated the Win Now actions followed by now a return to growth and healthier conditions. Is that a reasonable time line or playbook to think about China? And then just maybe bigger picture, if you are viewing some of these headwinds currently and resets more as temporary, maybe just expand on why not providing maybe 2- or 3-year out targets or a little bit more specificity around the time line to get back to double-digit margins.

Elliott Hill
CEO, President & Director

Yes. In terms of China, what I said earlier is we've taken actions. We're cleaning up. We feel good about having a handle on what has happened in China and more importantly, what we must go do. And it's going to take a fresh perspective and a new approach and ultimately some new capabilities. And so -- and we're working with and through partners which, again, that's where it gets tough to put an exact date on it, but we're confident in the path forward and the team that we have in place, and we're ready to get that business moved and turned as quickly as we possibly can.

Matthew Friend
Executive VP & CFO

Jon, I'd just say on your timing question, we're operating in a dynamic environment for both consumers and for a global business. And we're trying to turn around our business across 3 brands, multiple sports in 4 geographies. And as a result of that, it's complicated what we're trying to do. We're encouraged by what we've been able to do in North America.

And I think we've got a clear path of what we need to do across the other dimensions of our business. But we're reading and reacting every day. And it's important right now that we've got the flexibility to be able to make the right decisions every week as we're trading the business in order to be able to establish the long-term health of our brands. And so for the near term, we're going to continue with this consistent practice that we've been doing. And as our confidence grows, we will certainly share greater insight into how we're thinking about the longer term.

Our final question will come from the line of Simeon Siegel with Guggenheim Securities.

Simeon Siegel
Guggenheim Securities, LLC

So Elliott, just to follow-up a little bit, the North America revenue growth, it was just such a big number even before accounting for just the large Classics reset. So can you just speak to what product is growing domestically so much that is enough to accelerate that revenue growth this much and just way more than offset the ongoing reset?

And then, Matt, it feels like the growing wholesale penetration should help that operating overhead maybe structurally. So just curious if you can give us any thoughts where operating overhead goes. And then as you think about that opportunity, is the idea that you can take a portion of that and fund it back into demand creation, which has always been one of your key competitive advantage?

Elliott Hill
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Simeon, thanks and also wishing you and your family a happy holidays as well. In terms of North America growth, Running, obviously, is a big piece, and it's not just growth, sell-in, what we're encouraged by sell-through. We're actually having -- taken market share. So we're feeling good about that.

Global football, soccer, we're seeing growth there. We're seeing growth in training. SKIMS as well would be another one I'd call out. And then basketball. The team is doing a really good job with basketball right now. And again, I touched on a few, but like the G.T. Future this weekend was phenomenal. And while sportswear is not growing, they've done a really nice job of rightsizing sportswear and starting to diversify the portfolio across the look of Running, which is primarily driving it. But we also have some footwear on the women's side in sportswear, Air Max Muse and the Superfly, that's doing well.

And then, of course, Jordan. I've got to call Jordan out when we speak about North America. They've done a really nice job, and we had a great sell-through of the AJ4 Black Cat. We're getting back to telling stories. By the way, that was our largest Black Friday ever. That Black Cat was launch ever. And then just recently it's not in this quarter, but the AJ11 Gamma, we had people lining up for that shoe again, which is fun to see, see kids lining up for sneakers again. So I think the team has done a really nice job of making certain that they're running a complete and balanced portfolio across the brands in sports.

Matthew Friend
Executive VP & CFO

Simeon, I'd just add that the growth that we delivered in North America in Q2 was certainly strong. And if you look at what our guidance for Q3, we said that we expect modest growth in North America, and you can really sort of connect the dots between the amount -- how much liquidation fueled the growth in Q3 versus what's going to be great comp full price growth as we get into the third quarter. And so hopefully, that helps you connect the dots a little bit between the second quarter and the guidance for Q3.

In terms of your question on cost leverage, absolutely correct. Growth creates leverage on the cost structure. Wholesale growth, in particular, creates meaningful growth on the cost structure led by unit growth. And you see it not only in the supply chain costs where you're shipping pallets of product to partners versus shipping 101 units to consumers, but you also will see it more broadly across our operating overhead.

We're certainly focused on continuing to prioritize our investment in demand creation. I wouldn't lead that to believe that we've necessarily decided we're going to go much higher than the 10% of revenue at this point in time because we feel like that gives us a good amount of investment to be able to continue to drive our brand forward. But if I'm prioritizing between the 2, we certainly want to have more flexible liquid demand creation to create big moments that impact consumers and to be able to activate that on the ground in key cities. And so we're going to continue to tightly manage costs on the operating overhead side. As Elliott said, we've got a number of things that we're looking at here, and we look forward to sharing more in the coming quarters.

And that will conclude our question-and-answer session and our call today. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.
