[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Lance Vitanza with TD Cowen.

Lance Vitanza
TD Cowen, Research Division

Congratulations on getting the restatement done. My question would be with respect to the Honey Pot. My recent channel checks seem to suggest both more shelf space and also faster inventory turns than at least I had expected. And I'm wondering if you could comment on how the performance has been shaping up relative to your internal expectations? And to the extent there's been outperformance on that basis, what do you think the drivers of that have been?

Elias Sabo
CEO & Director

Sure. And thank you, Lance. First feels good to be back up to date with all of our filings and the company getting back to a more normal operating level. With respect to the Honey Pot, this is really an extraordinary brand. I think we told you when we bought this business that this was a company that was founded by an extraordinary woman and that she was really changing kind of the entire industry and using better-for-you products. And it was mostly a business that was in the kind of more of the hygiene side, and it was not in the broader part of the feminine hygiene market. It was in more of the washes and wipes. And so that's a very small market.

One of the things that the company has been able to do, and it was always part of the plan was to extend the brand into other categories. And in this case, the company has been able to get into the menstrual category, which is a massive market compared to the market they were entered into before. And we've had very successful execution. Our product really does stand for something in our brand and with our customers, it's extendable into other adjacent categories. And so what we've seen is more shelf space being dedicated to us in this new category, and our turns are doing really extraordinarily well. So relative to expectations, I can tell you the company is significantly outperforming expectations given kind of the additional shelf space that we continue to talk to our retailers about as the next year gets set, we expect that growth to continue. And we're investing in the brand. You just see a lot more marketing. It was always our strategy. And so everything is coming together, and it is really producing wonderful results. And I think '26 is shaping up to be a great year.

Lance Vitanza
TD Cowen, Research Division

That's really helpful. I appreciate it. If I could just squeeze in one last question. On the divestiture front, and I know you've talked about this previously, but could you just sort of remind me like are there any assets that are off the table there that you would just simply not consider selling at any price? Or should we just consider this you're going to look to maximize shareholder value. And if that's subsidiary, XYZ, it's subsidiary XYZ?

Elias Sabo
CEO & Director

Yes. I would say everything -- our model has always been everything is for sale at all times. It all comes down to the value that you're willing to pay. And to the extent that's attractive to us, we would always be a seller under those circumstances. Nothing has changed with respect to that, Lance. So absolutely, all of our businesses remain available for sale because that's the basic kind of business model that we have. Now I would tell you that some of our companies that are growing really fast and have great dominant market positions. And I think we all know kind of some of those businesses that we have. Look, the valuation expectations are going to be really high. And if they fail to materialize, we are in a position where although we would like to divest the business, we don't have to and what we won't do is take a big discount on a premium asset.

And so I would just say, yes, everything remains available for sale. That's always been the case. We do have a firm-wide desire to be in divestment mode in order to shrink our balance sheet to get back to normal leverage and then have capital allocation available to us again. Stephen mentioned, part of that is clearly looks at buying back stock as a capital allocation opportunity. And at these prices, we would think that's pretty attractive. So divestment is what we would like to achieve, but it is not without kind of respect to valuation, and we'll be very disciplined in executing that.

Our next question comes from Larry Solow with CJS Securities.

Lawrence Solow
CJS Securities, Inc.

Great. Welcome back, I guess, to the current financial world. Also just want to extend my best wishes to both Pat and Jim, great working and personal relationships with both of them. So I wish you guys both best of luck. I guess first question lies is just kind of just broad brush. I know you called out good color on all your holdings, quite frankly. But growth seems like it slowed a little bit. I think you grew kind of 8% first quarter and 2% or 3% this quarter. It looks like it's probably more just timing in some of your bigger holdings like BOA. I think maybe timing there and also the Chinese exit. So -- but just from a broad brush, how do you see the economy like today versus -- I know you had a lot of other things on your mind, but maybe at the start of the year and just...

Elias Sabo
CEO & Director

Yes. Thank you, Larry. Thank you for the warm wishes for Pat and Jim. They have both been really valuable participants here in building Compass and have become friends with us all, and we wish them the best in their future endeavors. With respect to the economy and kind of how we see things or saw things unfold, yes, we did have a really strong Q1 and things moderated in Q2 and Q3. We saw a little bit of a pull forward of some demand that we think otherwise would have materialized on a more normalized pattern with the kind of Liberation Day announcement and there was a period of time where you could still bring some goods in, and I think everybody kind of rushed to do that.

So there's a bit of distortion, I would say, quarter-to-quarter because of that. But look, if we're going to normalize for that, there still is a bit of a slowdown that occurred after Liberation Day. And as you'd anticipate, there's -- look, a lot of inflation. There was some inflation that came through still, and it was very disruptive for a lot of companies. And I think consumers just got to the point where they weren't willing to take any additional inflationary pressures. So that's been a very difficult environment in which to operate. I would say 5.11 has probably had the biggest impact from that because we produce in Southeast Asian countries, not China. We were, I think, quick enough to get out of China when the President was in his first term and there was a lot of rumblings.

But in adjacent markets where you produce a lot of apparel, there's still 20% tariffs and you have a customer set that is very reticent to take any incremental price increases, that's a tricky spot that companies, I think, across a lot of different industries are finding themselves in. So it may not impact directly a BOA or PrimaLoft. But if our customers are feeling those same headwinds, then that impacts us. And so I'd say broadly, Larry, these tariffs have kind of slowed down at least the consumer side of the business. The industrial side of the business clearly had a very unique kind of impact from the export restrictions that China put on rare earth minerals.

As a result of that, there's -- as you see in Arnold's results, millions of dollars of EBITDA reduction that occurred. I think that is a little bit more kind of one-off, and we expect that to revert back to normal in 2026. And so that had some impact on kind of the weaker results in the back half of the year. But I would just say broadly, things slowed a little bit, but still feel like they're growing.

Lawrence Solow
CJS Securities, Inc.

Yes. And I know, listen, you're not giving guidance for next year yet, but you have spoken about sort of getting your leverage down organically into the mid-4s. So that would imply some growth. And it does feel like you're -- even if consumer slows a little more, you'll -- Altor sounds like it's going to -- I know it's basically flat this year, maybe organically, but it seems like that's not really -- a lot of that's noneconomically related with the cold storage. And as you mentioned, Arnold should bounce back a little bit, right, next year, hopefully. So it feels like your outlook, you're kind of holding into that outlook, continue to at least grow somewhat next year without getting ahead of our skis.

Elias Sabo
CEO & Director

Yes. We're going to give an outlook for next year here, I guess, sooner rather than later because we're going to have our year-end call more quickly than normal. But I would say, Larry, we have very strong expectations that we will have a growth year next year and that our free cash flow is going to be very strong. And heretofore, we have not produced actual free cash flow because it's been invested in growth in working capital and other assets.

In 2026, when you talk about deleveraging path, there's 2 forms that it comes in. One is we expect growth of the portfolio. And number two, we expect to grow and have actual free cash flow that repays indebtedness and has a lower gross amount of debt at the end of the year. So when you -- so that is going to be something, and we're not giving guidance today, but I would tell you, when we do give it in 5, 6 weeks or whatever the timing is, it's going to include that kind of like foundational tenets.

Lawrence Solow
CJS Securities, Inc.

Awesome. That sounds great. If I could just one more housekeeping question. Stephen, just on -- can you give us a sense of sort of like a normalized management fee today. I guess it sounds like there'll be some noncash accounting true-up in Q4 that will kind of roll through the P&L next year. But -- so maybe as we enter '27, obviously, your company may look a whole lot different. But based on what the current holdings and net asset value is, like can you give us an idea what that normalized number would -- and then...

Stephen Keller
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think it's -- so look, obviously, we need to do a little bit of work to true up all the kind of overpaid management fees. And like as you mentioned, there will be some adjustments in Q4. But from a management fee cost perspective, noncash, I would say, for next year, I think it's probably -- you can probably assume it's in the -- it's around $55 million, including what's paid directly by the subsidiaries. That's probably a good number based on our current portfolio of businesses and excluding any impact from Lugano -- excluding any fees, obviously, Lugano will be deconsolidated and those assets won't be under management.

From a cash perspective, next year, it will be substantially less as basically CODI will have lower cash payments to CGM to make up for the overpaid management fees that have been paid historically. So cash will be a lot less. But from an accounting perspective, you can assume around $55 million.

Our next question comes from Timothy D'Agostino with B. Riley Securities.

Timothy D'Agostino
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

Congrats on being current in everything, really big accomplishment. I guess my first question kind of goes back to asset sales. It would be great to get some color on who might be interested or how you might go about a sale, not necessarily what you're selling. The reason why I ask is I think back to Fox Factory, and I wonder if there's any potential of like maybe like bringing a company public and that being a way of sale -- way to sell an asset. So I guess my question is, what are the different avenues you can explore when going to sell one of these assets?

Elias Sabo
CEO & Director

Yes. Tim, thank you for the question. This is Elias. In selling an asset, I mean, I think there are a number of avenues. Fox was an example of an IPO. If you remember not too long ago, we filed actually right before the market kind of took a turn for the worst in 2022, an IPO for 5.11. And we withdrew that just because of market conditions, but that's a company that is kind of a size that potentially could explore that kind of pathway. And in fact, other companies are at that size or getting to that size as well.

So IPO becomes an absolute route for which we can monetize the position. I think that route has the benefit of unlocking value and demonstrating that to the market, but it does not have the benefit of quick deleveraging because inevitably, we become a large holder of those shares, and we have to, over a series of years, make orderly sales to be able to monetize that. So although I think that is a great way for us to monetize assets, and we have that in our portfolio of things we would do, I would say it comes at the cost of not having quick liquidity.

For faster liquidity, I'd say the routes are through investment banks typically that we engage and they go out and talk with kind of strategic buyers, private equity buyers. Tim, understand because we're in the market all the time and we're engaging in the market, we're getting inbounds and we are talking with bankers constantly about strategics or other PE firms that may have interest in our assets and then conversely assets that we may have interest in. Now '25, we weren't doing really the latter, looking for assets clearly. But there's always kind of that chatter that is going on.

So I think just in the normal operations, we have a pretty good understanding of where strategics are right now by our different companies and their acquisition cycles. who's expressed interest, who has not, where PE firms are in that process. And what we try to do is get a sense of what is the demand for an asset like this, typically using investment banking partners to help us do that. And the ones that we feel we can get the greatest amount of interest and demand for are assets that we're kind of bringing out to market.

Now I will say, and we've said this before, we have a couple of assets, a few that we are looking at this. We don't -- we're not saying we're going to sell multiple assets this year, but we do want to execute against a sale, and we don't want to give leverage to any potential buyer. And so in that process, we'll look at a few different businesses that we feel there's sufficient demand in the marketplace to warrant a good value and then we'll determine which one that we will want to divest based on how the market materializes.

Timothy D'Agostino
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. That's super helpful color. And then if I can just ask another. Going forward in '26, the way you oversee the portfolio companies, has your oversight changed for how you go about it? If you could just provide any color there.

Stephen Keller
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So I think what we talked about on the restatement call is that from an internal audit perspective and a compliance perspective, we have made some changes. We did decide to outsource our internal audit function with the idea that using a third party would allow us to do 2 things. One, it allows us to easily scale up and down the size of the team based on the assets that we have and the companies that we're running. And then the second thing is also when you use an outsourced team, when you get businesses that are -- have unique characteristics, it's easy for you to get industry-specific experience and quickly flex it up and down.

And so we think the changes in internal audit and compliance moving to an outsourced model will be a better model. That's the primary change that we are making in terms of the oversight. There's also some other internal processes that we'll be looking at. But we do want to recognize, the situation with Lugano was very, very terrible. It was unprecedented. It was also very unique and very unique to that situation. So as we talked about on the other call, we have -- we'll probably change a little bit of some of our criteria where we would not necessarily want to have a someone who is a founder, still CEO, still owns 40% and a key man, that's probably a risk that we, in retrospect, would like to structure differently if we had another deal.

So we will make some changes like that. But overall, we got to remember that the situation at Lugano was very, very isolated to Lugano. And so generally speaking, the model that we have had and the oversight we've had of these companies have worked very, very well for 20 years. And this is a very unique situation driven by a very unique individual.

Our next question comes from Matt Koranda with ROTH Capital.

Matt Koranda
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

Best wishes to Pat, you'll be missed. I guess what I wanted to make sure I understood, it sounds like we're motivated to sell an asset at some point this year, but we don't feel a whole lot of pressure given you have multiple good assets that you could potentially sell. The 4.5 leverage covenant that you have by midyear, is that something you could actually attain organically even just given the cash unlock from working capital that you could get this year?

Stephen Keller
Executive VP & CFO

So first of all, it's not a -- there's an incentive to get below 4.5. If we're not below 4.5, there's a payment. We won't be out of covenant. The covenant is actually higher. So we will be in covenant -- we are now and we will continue to be all next year. There is a -- look, with some recovery from Lugano, assuming that we have, there would be a path to getting below 4.5% organically, but it would be tighter than we would like, which is one of the reasons why we're trying to operate in a sense that we will be able to organically delever and therefore, that allows us to -- any asset sales to accelerate it and gives us more comfort.

So we'll go down both paths. We're not going to sell -- we do not want to sell a business at a discount that will destroy shareholder value. So we're focused on being able to get below if we -- if a sale at the right valuation doesn't materialize. We do, however, expect to sell a business.

Matt Koranda
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

Okay. All right. That's fair. That helps. And then I just wanted to hear a little bit more about Arnold and supply chain disruption, how long that sort of should be playing out or if it's already essentially solved in your mind and that just is going to take a little time to percolate through the business. Just an update there.

Elias Sabo
CEO & Director

Sure. So as we all know, the trade liberation day and the tariffs on China caused a lot of global issues and retaliation by China in certain areas. Matt, the area where China has the most leverage is over rare earths, currently, something like 90% of all Neo magnets are produced in China, and I think something like 70% of all samarium cobalt, which is what we produce is produced in China. So they're just a massive player. They obviously have a lot of the raw material that's there. And these are absolutely integral as we think about the AI economy, alternate energy kind of production to serve the AI economy partly. And then robotics and electric cars, all of these things require rare earth magnets.

And so the future growth of economies is dependent on this. Clearly, China flexed their muscle and put export controls that we were not able to comply with. No company would have been able to comply with them. And as a result, that shut down pretty much all the business that we had that we could export out of China. That's kind of a $6 million to $8 million EBITDA disruption that we got hit with there. Now what's happened is China has loosened export controls and we're seeing products start to flow back out of China. But the longer term, so we expect normalization, and that's already happening in the fourth quarter. And we have a backlog that we need to obviously catch up. So that provides a good tailwind going into 2026.

Now the global landscape has really shifted because these are -- we work mostly with aerospace and defense customers. That's where samarium cobalt, magnets kind of really shine. And so that part of the market is very sensitive to just-in-time inventory ordering, and we deal with customers that are very -- the economy is dependent on them. Our national security is dependent on these customers. And so the stakes are very high. Clearly, our customers were rattled when we were not able to deliver product on schedule because of these export restrictions. And it wasn't just us, it was everybody they were buying from in China.

And so what we've seen, and this is where we believe there's a lot of bullishness around Arnold, and we think the upside trajectory for this company over the next few years is well above trend. There is a desire for a lot of our global customers to source their material in a more stable geography. And they're looking for U.S. or European or other Southeastern Asian country like Indonesia has got a Neo mine that's coming on. There is a big effort to diversify the supply base out of Mainland China, which is where it exists today. As we said in our prerecorded script, there's only a handful of us that can do that.

And so we sit in a pretty good position to be able to secure a lot of additional business and drive our business growth much faster than it otherwise would be. And that's why notwithstanding the short-term pain we suffered in 2025, I think in terms of underlying enterprise value of the Arnold business, this was a massive positive to that, and we expect it to manifest in future growth rate of earnings.

[Operator Instructions] And I'm not showing any further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Elias Sabo for any closing remarks. We do have one question...

Our next question comes from Cris Kennedy with William Blair.

Cristopher Kennedy
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Congrats on Pat's retirement. Just wanted to follow up on the last comment you made about Arnold. I mean it was almost a year ago when you had the Investor Day and you kind of gave long-term organic revenue growth targets for each of the subsidiaries. Any updated thoughts on that framework that you provided previously?

Elias Sabo
CEO & Director

Yes. I would say, obviously, clearly, Cris, we were wrong with Arnold in 2025. And so let's assume that we kind of get back to a normal baseline, which '24 would serve as a normal baseline year. I think we would expect those growth rates temporarily because I don't know if this is a long-term shift. That actually looks into use of robotics and other things that may have longer-term demand generation that is outside of what we are seeing today. In the short term, though, let's say, 3 to 5 years, we would expect a materially higher growth rate from Arnold given the supply chain disruptions that we talked about and the resourcing of production.

Cristopher Kennedy
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Okay. And how about the other subsidiaries now that you have more working capital to allocate potentially that Lugano has gone?

Elias Sabo
CEO & Director

Yes. No, we'll obviously talk more about that on our Q4 call and about our 2026 guidance. But I would say largely, our companies outside of Lugano are performing with the exception of Arnold that we mentioned are performing in line with expectation. Where we've noted we find things that are doing a little bit better is the Honey Pot. And I would say 5.11 is struggling a little bit because of tariffs. But largely, BOA, PrimaLoft, the other businesses, Sterno, they're performing in line with where our expectations are. And I'm not sure if you just went 1 year hence from last year's Investor Day, there'd be a lot of change. It probably would be more maybe 5.11's growth rate is a tad lower and Honey Pot is a tad higher.

Cristopher Kennedy
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Got it. Okay. And then I understand you're not going to give commentary in 2026. But can you just remind us of kind of what the free cash flow conversion is of the business or how we should think about that?

Stephen Keller
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks. It's a great question. I think it's really important to think about because 2 things have really changed since last year, which is one is Lugano no longer be in the portfolio, which is a significant user of working capital. Our underlying businesses now generate a substantial more amount of cash. That, coupled with the elimination of the common dividend suggests that we will, from a free cash flow perspective, be creating pretty significant free cash flow. We actually expect -- depending on working capital usage and the timing, we'd expect that in 2026, that we should generate between $50 million to $100 million of free cash flow after everything, after interest, after dividend, after preferred dividends and all capital CapEx, et cetera.

So that is a marked change from, I would say, where we have been historically. And so that is something that we're -- that's one of the reasons why we're very confident in the fact that we will be able to organically delever on top of looking at these more strategic, more rapid delevering activities.

Operator

I would now like to turn the call back over to Elias Sabo for any closing remarks.
