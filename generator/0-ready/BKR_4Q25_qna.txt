[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan Chase.

Arun Jayaram
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Your prepared remarks underscored Baker's power systems capabilities across a broad range of end markets. You mentioned you booked $2.5 billion of power systems orders in 2025. I know the business has been a strategic focus, thinking back to the BRUSH acquisition and your organic growth opportunities from the NovaLT gas turbine line. Can you elaborate on your strategy for further enhancing your current capabilities or sustaining growth from power systems on a go-forward basis?

Lorenzo Simonelli
Chairman & President

Definitely, Arun, and thank you very much. And let me just start by reiterating that we believe that we're in a global power demand multiyear growth cycle. In fact, a demand decade, as we said last week, and we're very much in the early stages of that trend worldwide and in the United States. If you look at current projections indicate that power demand will double by 2040 driven by the factors such as data centers, digital infrastructure, artificial intelligence, widespread adoption of EVs, also the transition of industrial processes from fuel-based to electric power solutions, HVAC cooling across the board, a huge increase in demand. And this really is a critical need that then manifests itself for reliable and scalable energy systems. And we think that, in particular, on AI infrastructure, we expect to see a doubling in the investment and it's going to reach $1 trillion by the end of this decade, which presents a substantial opportunity for Baker Hughes.

As you saw from the prepared pages, we've identified a market opportunity of $100 billion annually for power systems by 2030. And we've got a range of solutions available and also in development. And in 2025, power systems orders totaled $2.5 billion with $1 billion directly linked to data center applications. So you look at also what we laid out, we now see data center orders to total $3 billion between 2025 and 2027. And it represents over 150% growth compared to last year's power systems orders, which is a clear indication of the acceleration that we're seeing and also the customer adoption. So there's a large broad addressable market that is significant. And it goes beyond just the NovaLT, it really focuses on core capabilities around power generation, grid stability and energy management.

And so as you look at some of the other things that are taking place, we also secured orders of 1.3 gigawatts for aeroderivative gas turbines within the oil and gas, including upstream gas infrastructure, FPSOs, refining, which demonstrates, again, the aspects of good prospects for distributed power solutions in our core market. Also, geothermal, as you look at the order with Fervo, 300 megawatts Organic Rankine Cycle unique position with ourselves as being the geothermal subsurface and surface power generation capabilities, the 40 BRUSH generators for gas-fired utility-scale power plants and collectively delivering approximately 7 gigawatts of reliable power.

Synchronous condensers technology that address the multibillion-dollar market that is projected to grow as renewable energy integration increases. And so we're seeing lots of new opportunities as well as energy storage being able to leverage our turboexpander and generate a portfolio as we look to see more integrated power solutions, as you also saw in the Tengiz project in Kazakhstan. And not to forget also in the nuclear space where we provide steam turbine generators to support the small modular reactor projects and, on the overlay, the Cordant digital hardware and software solutions and the aftermarket service business.

So you've got a lot of range of applications, end markets. And as we look to Chart, that's going to further strengthen the power portfolio by adding thermal management capabilities and deliver integrated trigeneration power solutions. So very excited. And I think in summary, you're looking at a multiyear cycle. It's driving long-term growth, operational resilience, low carbon readiness, and we've got a versatile portfolio that's going to add significantly growth for Baker Hughes going forward.

Our next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup.

Scott Gruber
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Lorenzo, you offered a very robust $14.5 billion IET order intake guide for '26. Can you walk through some of the moving pieces within that guide? Which segments are seeing some growth which may be down some? Sounds like LNG will be stable, but what are the moving pieces? And then inbound exceeded your initial expectations last year, what could drive upside this year? Would that most likely come from the power vertical?

Lorenzo Simonelli
Chairman & President

Yes, definitely, Scott. And again, I think as you look at the 2026 order outlook, it reflects the underlying strength that I mentioned previously as well across the broad and versatile IET portfolio. And it's really a strong start to achieving the 3-year $40-plus billion target for Horizon Two between 2026 to 2028. And I think if you take a step back and just reflect on the prior few years of Horizon One, that order strength has been highlighted as we've gone through the years of '23, '24 and '25.

As you look at LNG being strong in '23, then in '24, gas infrastructure and last year, power systems. And since 2023, our non-LNG equipment orders have delivered a compounded annual growth rate of over 20% and really represent about 85% of the total IET orders for both 2024 and '25, which again further demonstrates the breadth and diversification of our offerings. Looking at 2026, again, it's going to be the aspect of strong pipelines in power systems. We see our $2.5 billion orders from last year as a foundation for further growth, also taking up our data center intake. And as you see from the 3-year data center order outlook going to $3 billion, reflecting a healthy and growing pipeline.

Gas infrastructure, as you continue to see the growth in gas, we see continued increase in natural gas production to meet the global energy demands. As you look at new energy, we set a record in 2025 with $2 billion in orders and expect this trajectory to continue led by CCUS, flex-fuel power and geothermal solutions. And we've got a forecast for $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion and excited about geothermal as you heard from the Fervo example in '25 with our technology that we feel is very well positioned as well as then the legacy geothermal as well. And as we go forward, strength in really being able to seamlessly integrate subsurface expertise with subsurface power generation and the top side as well.

So as we look at 2026, again, feel good about that. And overall, another robust year and there's potential to continue to have some upside. We've given our order guidance at the midpoint. There's a number of projects that, again, will materialize in '26, '27 and feeling good about that $40-plus billion over the 3-year order target.

Our next question comes from Saurabh Pant from Bank of America.

Saurabh Pant
BofA Securities, Research Division

If you don't mind, I want to pivot to the margin side of things a little bit. Clearly, very resilient margins, especially on the OFSE side of things. Ahmed, I think if I got you right you were talking about practically flat margins SPC consolidation, right. That's better than what I was thinking. And that's despite all the headwinds between mix and pricing and tariffs, if you don't mind just stepping through that and how it's cost out helping that? And if you don't mind, just the moving pieces on the IET margin outlook as well, please.

Ahmed Moghal
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, for sure, Saurabh. Look, I find this always easier to build it up by segment. So starting with IET, the team's done a great job on the margin front, and we expect this trajectory to continue into 2026. So achieving 20% margin in 2026 would represent about 150 basis points year-over-year increase. And for context, of course, this is 500 basis points improvement since 2023 and that really has been driven by the success of both our commercial and operational efforts and as we continue to scale our business system across IET.

So just breaking it down in terms of how we expect to drive towards that 20%, it's a few key drivers. First, I would say, is just the continued conversion of our higher-margin Gas Tech Equipment backlog. So that's going to be a foundational component. Growth in Gas Tech Services, we expect to outpace the broader segment. And then, Cordant, you saw the robust order momentum. We'll enter the year with higher margin backlog, and that business can drive quite a bit of operating leverage. And look, we're also going to continue to optimize cost in IET, in areas where we know margins have lagged, so there's opportunity there.

And then just to round out this piece, the net impact of PSI and CDC, they're just very modestly accretive to margins in 2026. So with that context, I feel with the strong backlog visibility and the continued productivity actions we're going to drive, we're confident in achieving the 20% for IET in '26. So that's IET.

So when you look at OFSE, the '26 outlook we gave really reflects a theme that you've seen, which is a resilient margin profile despite the headwinds on a macro scale. So at the midpoint of our '26 guidance and when you compare that actually to peak '24 results, our 2026 outlook actually implies only about 50 basis points of margin decline on roughly 10% declining revenue, and that's on our organic basis. So we've been able to achieve that through what you've seen us systematically do around cost actions, quick cash paybacks and structural changes to how we operate, which has resulted in that durability.

So for '26, the modest year-over-year decline with organic margins expected to be flat. The major components, I'd say is, first, increased tariff costs, as you mentioned, impacting margins. That's going to be annualized impact carrying from '25 into '26. The second is a slight change in revenue mix with SSPS growing organically, while our higher-margin OFS business is projected to decline slightly.

And the last thing I'd say is what I mentioned around overall market pricing variability in different markets, and that will have a modest impact. And just to round out, similar to PSI and CDC and IET for SPC, the deconsolidation will be modestly dilutive to OFSE margins in '26. So all of this, what we're doing for OFSE specifically is just to address the headwinds, just ongoing productivity, supply chain optimization, that's going to be very key and just those overall efforts, all with a line of sight to quick cash paybacks.

So that will help us position OFSE in a very strong manner as market conditions improve later this year or into '27. So to round out total company, our guidance implies nearly 18% in 2026, which then implies 200 basis points improvement in achieving the 20% target by 2028. And we're confident in the strategy to reach this milestone, and that's driven by performance across both segments. So hopefully, that gives a bit of color, Saurabh.

Our next question comes from James West from Melius Research.

James West
Melius Research LLC

So I was wondering if you could provide an update on the progress of your comprehensive strategic evaluation and beyond the targeted cost-out initiatives that you've mentioned, are there additional aspects of the evaluation that you can discuss kind of at this time? And then maybe additionally, can you elaborate on what investors, and we should expect from Baker Hughes in the near future regarding this announcement?

Lorenzo Simonelli
Chairman & President

Yes, James, I want to emphasize our comprehensive evaluation is a disciplined, ongoing process really designed to ensure Baker Hughes continues to create sustainable long-term value creation for shareholders. And the evaluation represents a strategic, operational and financial assessment through which we are considering a broad range of strategic options. The comprehensive evaluation remains closely aligned with our key execution priorities. These include the closure and integration of Chart, driving operational performance improvements, optimizing our portfolio and disciplined capital allocation. And these strategic priorities, combined with the evolving market conditions and the broader strategic landscape, help shape the Board's perspective of the company's long-term direction and the available strategic options.

As we continue to advance our comprehensive review, our immediate focus is on completing the pending Chart acquisition and subsequently ensuring a disciplined value creative -- accretive integration. And in summary, I think our ongoing comprehensive evaluation is focused really to position Baker Hughes for stronger returns, sustainable growth and the creation of long-term value for our shareholders. And as we progress the evaluation, we'll provide timely updates.

Our next question comes from Marc Bianchi from TD Cowen.

Marc Bianchi
TD Cowen, Research Division

Could you describe your opportunity in Venezuela?

Lorenzo Simonelli
Chairman & President

Yes, definitely. And obviously, a lot happening in Venezuela at the start of the year with some of the political changes and the opportunity for incremental production out of the country. Unlocking that is going to require new investment in the country's oil and gas sector, and we're taking a prudent long-term view as we continue to evaluate opportunities and also the activity we have in the market. To give you a historical context because Venezuela is not new to us. And as you look at Baker Hughes, both from the oilfield services and equipment as well as the industrial energy technology segment side, we've generated in the past in 2012 as a reference point, $0.5 billion of revenue in Venezuela, and we've had a large presence in the country.

We're one of the only American service companies that's maintained the ongoing presence in Venezuela, supporting the licensed operators with activities as they've gone forward. And we've got a large technology base and the largest installed base of oilfield power generation and more than 1,200 oil production systems as well as flexible pipe and other energy infrastructure. And as you think about Venezuela's production decline and aging infrastructure, we expect moderate production increases will require substantial investment in well integrity, off-grid power generation, equipment replacement, upgrades and services. And there's a significant ramp in oil production would provide opportunities across Baker Hughes enterprise on the oilfield services as well as the industrial energy technology standpoint.

And as we go forward, we're obviously working with the authorities. Main consideration is the safety and being able to ensure the safetiness of our employees and the operating conditions and having also the clarity on legal and regulatory framework as we go in for the long-term aspects. And the incremental opportunity of revenue is significant, and we'll be obviously programmatic as we go back and there's a lot of work in progress, and we'll evaluate as we get clearer line of sight. And we look forward to the continued conversations as the opportunity emerges and we see the activity increase.

Our next question comes from David Anderson from Barclays.

John Anderson
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

A lot to digest today, Lorenzo. I wanted to focus on the NovaLT, if we could. You've now doubled your 3-year data center order target to $3 billion. Does this also mean you've expanded NovaLT capacity as well? I think it was about a year ago you announced a doubling of initial capacity. So are you sold out for '27 deliveries? And is this further capacity expansion? Is this related to that 1 gigawatt for the slot reservation for new data center that you showed in the presentation this morning?

Ahmed Moghal
Executive VP & CFO

Dave, yes, it's -- I'll give some color on this. So as you said, we are on track to double our Nova capacity by the first half of '27. And the way to think about it is really as you include those planned capacity additions, our Nova slots are effectively full through 2028, which reflects, obviously, that strong and diversified demand you've seen across multiple end markets, including behind-the-meter power applications. So that incremental capacity will come online in the first half of '27 and will support the 2 gigawatts of Nova orders that we booked to backlog during '25. But going forward, we continue to monitor the market closely through our dynamic planning process.

So you can be sure that any decision to further expand Nova capacity beyond the current doubling will be based on a disciplined assessment that we would carry out on medium- to long-term supply and demand fundamentals and, of course, guided by very clear return thresholds. So to sum it up, really, our current and planned NovaLT capacity is fully committed through '28, but we are prepared to respond quickly if market conditions and customer demand warranted.
