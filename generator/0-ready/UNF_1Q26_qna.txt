Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will be coming from Manav Patnaik of Barclays.

Ronan Kennedy

This is Ronan Kennedy on for Manav. Steve, may I ask if you could please remind us of the timeline for achieving the long-term objectives of the mid-single-digit organic and high teens adjusted EBITDA margins? And then specifically, any significant milestones we should be mindful of through fiscal '26 and '27. And lastly, what gives you confidence in successful execution?

Steven Sintros
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Good question, Ronan. As you mentioned, we had talked about those milestones over the last couple of years. We had not given specific fiscal years for the achievement of those particular milestones, but when you look out over the next couple of years, our guidance for '26 is our guidance for '26. We expect to see steady improvement as we go through '27 and '28, getting closer to those mid-single-digit numbers.

I would say, by the third year or so. When you look at the profitability side, again, this year, our guidance is our guidance. We have a lot inflecting in the next 18 to 24 months with the execution of our key initiatives and the completion of some of our tech projects. There are some large scale profitability benefits that we're going to enable over the next year or so. And again, we're not kind of giving guidance for '27 or '28 right now. But we believe that as we get through '27, you'll start to hit some of that inflection.

Now one of the things that at least over the course of this year into next year, we have to keep an eye on is the impact of tariffs on our cost structure and so on. But we do feel like as you get to a year from now, you're going to start to have better line of sight to the inflection of some of those large-scale initiatives that will be starting to come into our results. We have a lot of confidence in the plan we've put forth. We think there's a lot of real benefits to be yielded. And it's really a matter of time in executing these tech transformations and getting to the finish line.

Ronan Kennedy

And then if not mistaken, I think fiscal 4Q '25 was the highest quarter in new account installation, that momentum appears to have been sustained. Can you talk about those strategic investments in growth and the new customer acquisitions, but also the investments that you're making in the sales force, the service organization and any initial impacts from the UniFirst Way initiatives through the COO?

Steven Sintros
President, CEO & Director

Yes, sounds good. I mean starting with the sales organization, we talked a lot in the fourth quarter about the -- call it, restructuring of the sales organization, adding different roles into the sales organization to ensure that we have the right level of sales representative in front of the right prospects. So it's more of a tiered sales organization than it's been in the past. There was some strategic head count increases that were made primarily in the back half of that year, back half of last year, and we're starting to see good progress on the sales rep productivity and the yield from those additional resources in that restructuring.

From a service perspective, again, kind of reiterating what we talked about in our fourth quarter earnings call, a number of strategic head count additions to help bolster account management, account retention, adding some breadth and capacity to our service organization because when you think about our growth model, new account sales is obviously a key part of that. When you look at the other key components of our growth formula, whether it be retention, strategic upsell into our customer base as well as the management of price across our customer base.

Our service organization has a large responsibility into executing those 3 other pillars of growth. So adding some of those strategic resources is starting to get us ahead in a number of those areas I talked about in the quarter, how we're starting to see some momentum in customer upsell as well as some sequential or continued improvement, I should say, in new account or existing account retention. So it's really a number of those things in the service organization coming together to drive the growth model.

And that does filter into the service -- the operations execution with the UniFirst way. When we talk about renewing accounts and the discipline around ensuring that we're managing our account renewal process, just as an example, in a very disciplined, organized way. We've talked over the course of last year, how our metrics around accounts renewed continued to sequentially improve, and it's not a surprise that's yielding improved overall customer retention. So that's one example I can give of our overall operational execution discipline yielding benefits in our growth model through our service organization investments.

I know you asked a lot of pieces to that question. Feel free to follow up if I didn't answer what you've asked.

And our next question will be coming from Tim Mulrooney of William Blair.

Timothy Mulrooney
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Just sticking on this higher new account growth conversation. I think you characterized that in your prepared remarks, even as strong new account sales. So I was hoping you could unpack that a bit more for me. Curious if the accounts -- the new accounts that you're winning, which I think you said was higher year-over-year, which was good to hear. Does that broadly match your customer mix? Or are you noticing, I don't know, a higher number of new accounts from any particular industry or client type?

Steven Sintros
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I talk about it less in terms of industry and probably more in terms of customer size. When I talk about some of the structural changes we've made in our sales organization to more of a tiered model, we had previously talked about sales in the context of national accounts or local accounts. Well, there's a large UniFirst of accounts that fall in between the, say, $80 a week account and the true national accounts, and we're really making more progress over time in those midsized accounts.

And that was really part of that investment in this tiered selling organization where we have sales reps focused on that tier of customer as opposed to just the 2 ends of the spectrum. So that's been an evolution over the last couple of years, and that's something we're going to continue because we think we can yield a lot better success in that midsized customer demographic, and we're starting to see the success there.

Timothy Mulrooney
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

And you had strong new account growth, but you did mention in your prepared remarks, growth somewhat tempered by softer employment climate, which, I guess, affected your rental customer accounts, you've highlighted net wearer levels as being a slight headwind in the last couple of quarters. But has that gotten progressively more difficult the last couple of months. We all can see the job numbers. And look, if you've got good strong new account growth, but your organic growth is low single digit, that implies that something is offsetting that, right? So I assume that's the net wearer levels, can you set me straight on that and talk about if that's gotten progressively more of a headwind recently.

Steven Sintros
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Probably the way I'd categorize it; it has gotten incrementally more impactful. And look, we are on a journey to building towards stronger growth, right? So when we talk about stronger new account sales, better retention. We still have progress to make in those areas. And the one in particular is that existing count penetration. So that is sort of the universe that encompasses the employment situation, but also the work that we do to continue to add product placements to our customers.

So yes, there was some incremental weakness in that area. And some of that was offset by some progress that we have made in product placements, but I think that continues to be the biggest opportunity over the next couple of years, combined with continuing our journey on improved retention to drive toward that mid-single-digit sustainable growth.

Our next question will be coming from Josh Chan of UBS.

Joshua Chan
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I was wondering about your unchanged revenue guidance because it sounds like you have decent momentum in the business. It sounds like you're installing some national accounts customers in the quarter, you made a couple of acquisitions. So I was wondering about the potential that the guidance could have been raised and maybe why it wasn't necessarily raised on the revenue side?

Steven Sintros
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Good question. I mean I think we're 1 quarter into the year, but I think your comment is correct. I think we do feel like we have some good momentum on the top line side. I think it's just a little early to kind of make meaningful changes to any of the guidance. But no, I think incrementally, we do feel positive about the top line. I think some of the economic weakness, I'll call it, that I just talked about. I made in my comments, some comments on direct sales side. Some of our customers just sort of incrementally less purchasing. So there's a little bit of a drag there as well. And given how early we are in the year, I think that's what landed us at the guidance that we've reiterated.

Joshua Chan
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And then -- on your comment earlier about hitting some sort of inflection in '27 in terms of these margin improvement initiatives. Could you just kind of bucket for us what categories of savings you expect to achieve with these projects and how they will kind of operationally flow through into the business?

Steven Sintros
President, CEO & Director

Sure. I mean there's a number of things, and I talked about some of them in a little bit more depth last quarter, but when you look at some of the bigger opportunities that are out there, I'll give a couple of examples. One of them is sort of the enablement of what I'll call, global inventory sharing, which is across our used garment portfolio, today, we don't meaningfully share used garments across different facilities.

And so that something we're actively working through with our tech initiatives as well as our operational execution teams to put the technology and processes in place to enable that. That has a meaningful impact. Now as you save on merchandise, as you all know, less new merchandise go in service ultimately materializes as what would have been new merchandise coming in service, amortizing over time. So it's not an immediate margin impact. So that's something that as we go through '27, we hope to be enabling and I don't have a date right now that I'd give to you to say when will that be enabled.

But then there will be a longer tail to that to get the full benefit of starting to reutilize that used merchandise in a more meaningful way. A couple of other opportunities that are somewhat larger scale. We have some new products that we will be launching in the facility service area that will allow us to penetrate our customers further, but also allow for some meaningful sourcing improvements in some of those products. And that's something again, that we expect to be launching over the course of '27. So part of the reason that '27 seems like a pivot year is because we believe it will be that a number of these things will be going live, but the full impact of them won't be hitting until later in that year or even into the year after.

So as we go forward over the upcoming quarters, we'll be able to crystallize some of that timing better for everybody. But there are some meaningful initiatives that we feel can inflect the margins. At the same time, some of the operational improvement things are more ongoing, and we'll start to build over the course of '27 into the upcoming years. That being said, there's still a fair amount of investment in execution around these tech and other initiatives to get them off the ground and that will keep, as we've talked about going through this year, some of the margins muted until we hit that inflection point.

But part of that journey is also, as you get to the other side of these things, meaningfully taking advantage of our new infrastructure to sort of moderate the G&A machine that we've been managing with all of these tech projects and other projects to a point where some of them will be enabled by the technology, more automation, centralization, inefficiency, and some will just be the wind down of some of the additional resources that are supporting all of these initiatives. So hopefully, that gives you a sense, it's not a just around the corner, but we are getting to a much closer line of sight to these things starting to inflect.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question will be coming from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.

Alexander EM Hess
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

This is Alex Hess on for Andrew Steinerman. I wanted to maybe start with the margins in the quarter. Could you elaborate how much of the in-year sales and service investments fell in 1Q? And should we expect this pace to continue? Or will it moderate from here? Just trying to sort of think about the margin impact there?

Steven Sintros
President, CEO & Director

Yes, good question. And I made the comment that some of these investments sort of materialized over the back half of last year. So when you think about that from a year-over-year quarter perspective, some of these margin impacts of these investments are more pronounced in the first quarter than they will be as you move throughout the year. Yes, I don't think it's a stretch to say that the first quarter from some of those specific investments is sort of the biggest impact based on the way those costs trended last year and the way we expect them to trend this year. I think that's what you're getting at with the question...

Alexander EM Hess
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And then on the ERP implementation, can you let us just sort of know what that stand -- where that stands? What still needs to be done? And keep in mind, this is a very big project for you guys. Do you have a firmer sense of when in '27 ERP implementation will be complete? And then anything we need to just sort of keep in mind with respect to the ERP implementation?

Steven Sintros
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So when you look at this year, there will be some releases scheduled for this year, the more core financial foundation of the ERP. In '27, there will be some supply chain-centric and some procurement enhancements that will come online. We don't have the exact end dates for those yet. But in the bulk of the next 18 months, this will be largely playing out. And that sort of fits with the timeline I'm giving as some of these benefits start to materialize. So this year is primarily still foundational and then as we get into next year, there is some more of those supply chain pieces that will come online.

Shane O’Connor
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. What I would add is when we first started talking about the ERP, we said that it was large or that the timeline took us largely through 2027 with that last release being supply chain-centric delivering some of the capabilities or enabling some of the capabilities that Steve spoke about sort of benefiting the latter half of '27 and into '28. That timeline really hasn't changed. Again, Steve had mentioned this year, we're going to be focused on the core finance modules and starting to progress that third and final release that will take us through 2027.

Operator

And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Steven Sintros for closing remarks.

Steven Sintros
President, CEO & Director

All right. I want to thank everyone for joining us this morning to review our first quarter results for fiscal '26 Thank you, and have a great day.
