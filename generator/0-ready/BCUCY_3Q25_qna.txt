[Interpreted] [Operator Instructions] The first question from Andrea Randone, Intermonte.


Andrea Randone
Intermonte SIM S.p.A., Research Division

I have two questions, one on the business and the other one on Russia business. So very good numbers there. It was perhaps a further comment on revenues in Asia that were particularly buoyant. Perhaps you can give us some colors on this and specifically Japan and if something has to be reported -- pointed out on retail or wholesale, if everything is -- or not? Second question, very interesting details you provided on Russia. And as an outsider, I wonder what are these customs checks. Did something specific happen in the past few days? Or are you just talking about the regular frequent checks? Yes, let's start from here.


Luca Lisandroni
MD, CEO & Executive Director

[Interpreted] Andrea, Luca speaking. So nothing special over the past few days. So these -- we have had over 100 custom checks since 2022 always. What kind of checks are these? Well, the documentation first, the documents, the accompanying documents. Secondly, sometimes to what extent the price matches, the pricing other -- of shipments to other countries, and there was nothing to report on this, never. As to your comment on results, we had 9 months that were particularly positive, and there is -- there are linear results. And for this reason, all the comments that we shared in August still hold true. So today, we basically defined the Americas results very good.

And there was no impact on the willing to shop on the purchases. Brunello traveled to Europe very often, and he was met with beautiful multi-brand stores. And yes, multi-brands are working hard in order to identify special goods and excellent results in Asia and China that we called a strong, modern and balanced market. Andrea, you see in China, our revenues amount to 13%, so -- but we came back from Milan and after speaking to all the different Asian markets, we came back with confidence, but definitely not on the last day because that's when we learned the news. And then to conclude, Japan, last year was a special year for Japan. But this year, too, it keeps being a great contributor. Yes, it was very special last year. Thank you, Andrea.

[Interpreted] The next question will be asked by Chris Huang of UBS.


Chris Huang
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I have three, if I can. The first one is on the trends you are seeing in the business. If we look at your retail performance in Q3, it seems like it saw quite a big acceleration versus Q2. So I'm just wondering what are the trends you're seeing within the quarter. I know this is not something you usually comment, but given that you're the first in the sector to report, would it be able to give us a little bit more flavor in terms of maybe September is growing faster than the quarterly average? Anything like that, that would be very helpful. Secondly, on a more kind of a P&L structure, can you just maybe remind us of the way you report? Because I think recently in the market, there's a lot of debate around cost of goods sold.

And if I remember correctly, you report production costs. So can you just remember -- remind us of what is the difference between the production cost report and then the typical cost of goods that we see for a company? And last but not least, on wholesale. I think currently, the wholesale channel is around one-third of your sales on a global level. Do you expect maybe perhaps in the future that this channel continues to decline in terms of its reliance? And do you have in mind a relative kind of ideal channel exposure you have for the midterm?


Unknown Executive

[Interpreted] Very interesting, Chris. So let me take your question about the multi-brand trend. So the beginning of the Winter season was very, very good. But please remember, Chris, that if you do -- well, if you look at retail, it doesn't really look like a great moment in time. I mean, people keep asking us how we're doing all the time. And what I'm telling is, well, we do plus 10%, which is quite reasonable, so to speak. At times, people say fashion is in trouble. And so my question is, why don't we just look at '21, '22, '23? Why don't we look at all financials from '21 to '25 altogether? Because if we do put these things together for the fashion industry as a whole, we have a good 5-year period.

Now as for this season, the general atmosphere is good, started off on the good foot. That's what we felt in the Milan Fashion Week. Of course, I keep talking about multi-brand stores, and I love multi-brand stores. But what do multi-brand stores do? Well, they boost our creativity. When we engage in research, we go to multi-brand stores because they would buy like maybe trousers from one brand, wear it with contemporary jackets from a different brand. And so that's all very interesting. Of course, multi-brand people should be very good at visual merchandising and lifestyle. But of course, novelty belongs to multi-brand stores, most of all.

So the trend now is that are going back to shopping in multi-brand stores, too. So multi-brands are doing well right now because people trust the sales associates they normally talk to because they know they'll come up with some interesting proposal for them. And then there's something else we should say. I mean, when you go to a single-branded store, that's one thing. But if you go and see Harrods, Neiman Marcus, Lane Crawford, I mean, you just walk in, take a tour and you see how your taste has been positioned and where it's been presented.

So you can actually see what your performance are, also depending on how you're located in multi-brand stores and the contemporary appeal of your brand is very visible, also depending on how you're displayed and merchandised in multi-brand stores. So of course, we do believe in multi-brand stores. It's growing a bit less than retail, but it's still growing. So should I think of the next 20 years, my project would involve multi-brand stores all the time. For us, it's always been an interesting channel. But besides actual sales, we look at brand positioning because multi-brand stores tell us where the collection is going and how it's performing. Now Chris, as to the accounting, our first margin is calculated as the difference between revenues and the cost of production.

So what is included in the cost of production, the cost of raw materials and consumption material and the cost of processing of these products. Other peers on the market, I mean, that's -- sorry, that's what we've always done to calculate cost of goods sold. So it's always been the same. So other companies, other peers actually match the cost of goods sold and the cost of production. And so besides the elements I just mentioned, they also add cost of prototyping, for instance, or the cost of in-house employees, which we actually classify as operating expenses. So that's maybe one difference between us and other peers. Thank you, Chris. Thanks for your questions.

[Interpreted] Next question will be asked by Charles Scotti of Kepler Cheuvreux.


Charles-Louis Scotti
Kepler Cheuvreux, Research Division

I have a couple for you. The first one, it doesn't seem to be the case, but have the allegations in the report had any impact on your relationships with your end clients and/or wholesale partners in U.S., Europe or Asia or eventually suppliers? And have the allegations led to a request for clarification from, I don't know, various authorities like the Italian market regulator as it was mentioned in the press? And secondly, thank you very much for all the information -- clear information about your exposure to Russia in particular and also concerning your inventory management.

Is it your final say? I mean, are you stopping there? Or do you believe it's necessary, I don't know, to appoint an external auditor to testify your statement and definitely remove any doubt on those allegations? And finally, last question regarding the exclusivity of your brand. I totally understand the importance of wholesale multi-brand and outlet partners for you. Do you plan at some point to strengthen the selectivity in terms of distribution in order to prevent some of the less qualitative partners from reselling your unsold goods to online discounters?


Brunello Cucinelli
Executive Chairman & Creative Director

[Interpreted] Okay. This is Brunello speaking. And I'll take your final question first. We have the best 400 wholesale accounts in the world. It's the 400 most beautiful stores in the world, and they've never created any problem at all for us. So in 2008, when the financial crisis happened, in October, November, some players started to extend some discounts, but it was just a one-off happenstance. So we are confident that we serve the 400 best stores in the world, and we're very happy with that. Something else is the impact on our clients. So as I told you, we sell to about 500,000 people. So of course, we tend to sell to wealthy people or well-off people at least.

And normally, wealthy people are really familiar with how profit is made and how much profit can be made. And so we are very confident about the image of our fashion house. So we realized in the last few days that there was no particular feedback. I mean, even the people who work at our showrooms didn't receive any particular comment on this. So we're not overly concerned. Of course, we could have done without this. But this doesn't mean we are concerned. Now Luca.


Luca Lisandroni
MD, CEO & Executive Director

[Interpreted] Yes. What we're doing is in-house. We are going through all of the internal control activities we've done over the years. And so far, we have seen no infringement and no violation that should worry us. We have asked law firm to actually help us and do an outside verification on the robustness of our in-house controls. This is what we're doing today. So thanks for your question, Charles. And don't be worried. I would like to take a bet and think about it again in 30 years' time or 40 years' time. So the wholesale world has always been the most important thing for us. I mean, up until maybe 20 years ago, the whole fashion world was wholesale only.


Operator

[Interpreted] The next question will be asked by Maria Meita of Bernstein.


Maria Meita
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

I have two. First one would be, are you aware of any investigations that the Italian authorities are undergoing following the short seller report? And then the second one regarding Harrods. Could you tell us more about the collaboration with Harrods for the festive season? And also what percentage of your sales would be in the U.K.


Brunello Cucinelli
Executive Chairman & Creative Director

[Interpreted] Thank you, Maria. Luca will answer your first question.


Luca Lisandroni
MD, CEO & Executive Director

[Interpreted] So well, we have no information about any investigation at all.


Brunello Cucinelli
Executive Chairman & Creative Director

[Interpreted] Now as far as Harrods are concerned, I will answer you, Maria. This is Brunello speaking. We're going to have three very important days in London. So we'll have the Harrods windows for 45 days between December 1 and January 15 with the changeover to the Spring-Summer collection on January 2, and we'll take over all the Harrods windows for those 45 days, which is really, really important. So we'll have the huge panel display for 45 days there.

And it's really major for us, very, very important because that's going to actually boost our image next year. So we work very beautifully with Harrods. And apart from that, we go back to the idea of multi-brand. So people go to Harrods, and they have as many as 15 million visitors every year. So that means that at least 5 million people should walk by our location. So it's a bit like in Dubai, they have 111 million people going through Dubai every time -- every year. So I really want to attach a lot of value to those beautiful stores all the time.

And then next year, while the film is going to be shown around the world, I'm not sure I'm happy to know that because that means I'll have to be all over the place. I want it to be a kind of a part-time monk, but it's not going to happen anytime soon. But actually, the movie is actually showing and showcasing the name of our brand. So hopefully, it's going to boost us a lot. So I've seen it myself, and it's embargoed until December 4, and I just sleep for 3 days after I first saw the movie.

[Interpreted] Next question from the Italian line from Melania Grippo of BNP Paribas.


Melania Grippo
BNP Paribas Exane, Research Division

Melania Grippo, BNP Paribas. I have two questions. I'd like to know whether in the quarter at European level, you saw any difference in the performance of the different countries, France, Germany, U.K., if you can comment on this.


Operator

[Interpreted] Just this, Melania.


Melania Grippo
BNP Paribas Exane, Research Division

You also said that your exposure to Russian market is 1%. In terms of Russian clients...


Operator

[Interpreted] Melania, could you please speak up because we can't hear you properly.


Melania Grippo
BNP Paribas Exane, Research Division

The second question has to do with the exposure to Russian customers, also including traveling, tourists. Any difference?


Unknown Executive

[Interpreted] Well, as far -- so in Europe, everything is going really well. I have to say that the weather helps because this is your classic kind of weather. As you know, the season starts well depending also on the weather in France, Germany, England, Italy. So we can say that the season has started -- was off to a pretty good start. And then Russian customers in the world, well, they are very, very important. And we find them everywhere. We saw how this changed in Dubai, in Turkey and everything. Melania, we have always maintained usually our sales, so we had high revenues in Russia, but many people moved. We envisage -- yes, of course, we sell to very wealthy customers.


Operator

[Interpreted] So if there are no further questions, Chiara Battistini wrote two questions. The first one is the growth in wholesale. And how much was this a result of new customers? And how much by loyal customers? Second question, whether we intend to better control the way in which the wholesale customers -- clients manage their sales.


Brunello Cucinelli
Executive Chairman & Creative Director

[Interpreted] Well, we have no new wholesale customers. I have to say that we enjoy a great relationship with them, and we trust them. But they are the most beautiful in the world. So it's not that we want to check and control them. As usual, we said, if something -- an issue arises with any of them, then we stop collaborating with them. But the only issue can be linked to financial issues. I'm very fond of Mr. Pressman, the owner of Barneys because -- and we were able to explode as a brand because 40 years ago, our products were displayed on Barney's windows.

And then, however, some economic issues followed, and that's what happened. We trust the multi-brands fully, but especially, we listen to them whenever they comment on the collections because if they are not happy, then that means that your product is aging. But if you go back home with your team and you basically say to your team that this was not very much appreciated, we can still work on it. And so we can do even better. Let me tell you something interesting.

Yesterday, Luca said, I am 45 years of age. I do not know the multi-brand channel that much. Whereas I, Brunello, I grew up with my esteemed, Hermès being displayed in the beautiful multi-brand stores and CHANEL too. Yes, that's what we talked about yesterday, Luca says. But honestly speaking, we have to say that many young managers, they're not familiar with the heritage of multi-brands. When you talk to them about multi-brands, you see they're not really familiar with it, not converse with.


Luca Lisandroni
MD, CEO & Executive Director

[Interpreted] Yes, when I was working in the eyewear sector, and that's when multi-brand -- that's where multi-brands are still doing strongly there, yes.


Operator

[Interpreted] Next question from Nick Anderson, Berenberg.


Nick Anderson
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

Sorry, just to get one in at the end. But in last week's press release, you referenced evaluating legal action to protect your reputation. I just wonder if you have any update on where you are in that process or thoughts on it.


Unknown Executive

[Interpreted] As we were saying earlier, Nick, right now, we're actually looking at our in-house control systems. And at the end of that moment, we will decide what we should do with Morpheus if we do anything. It's not something we have finalized yet. Well, Nick, can I tell you something nice? I mean this -- today, we saw the first collections for Winter '26, and we just love them. So you know how important that is for us.

We know we are a product company. I've always thought that product is actually the reason for everything. If you don't have a fully contemporary product, no matter what you do, you won't succeed. Once again, if -- well, speaking of the inventory, again, inventory is not something dead. It's the stock rooms of the stores. I mean it's really important. It's there for people to come in touch with.


Operator

[Interpreted] We have a question from Louise Singlehurst of Goldman Sachs, please.


Louise Singlehurst
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Just two questions for me. Firstly, I will just say thank you very much for hosting this call this evening to and bringing forward the results. My first question, just on the underlying regional growth. If we were to take the U.S. and China and exclude the new stores, would you be able to give us some of the like-for-like momentum in those markets or flavor versus for Q3 versus Q2? And then my second question was given all the noise over the past few days and having had the Board meet, is there any view on potentially changing or clarifying some of the disclosures a little bit differently going forward, particularly when it comes to things like inventory and understanding that more clearly?


Brunello Cucinelli
Executive Chairman & Creative Director

[Interpreted] Well, I'll take your second question first, says Brunello Cucinelli. We have changed nothing. This is actually what our company is all about. But we have changed nothing really. We haven't altered anything. So we have worked a lot in the recent days on this trouble, but just four, five of us, not the whole company. Now Luca will answer your other question.


Luca Lisandroni
MD, CEO & Executive Director

[Interpreted] Yes. The result comes from new locations plus existing stores, and there's a very good balance there. And as you know, we open new stores very carefully. So in the third quarter, we opened two stores, Abu Dhabi and Pudong, and these are the first two stores we opened in 2025 because throughout the first half of the year, we had new -- no new openings.


Brunello Cucinelli
Executive Chairman & Creative Director

[Interpreted] And this -- says Brunello Cucinelli, this always [indiscernible] to our exclusivity project because, of course, if you have a lot of points of sale, they are less exclusive. It's mathematical. It's one of the tenets in our exclusivity. So it means we are trying to live as long as 100 years as a brand. So I know I'm boring about this, but I always think of -- I don't know, Vacheron Constantin, 270 years of soul, [indiscernible] they do 30,000 pieces and they are pieces of jewelry. And that's why they are so exclusive, and they've been around for centuries.


Operator

[Interpreted] Next question will be asked by Paola Carboni of Equita.


Paola Carboni
Equita SIM S.p.A., Research Division

[Interpreted] The stronger growth that we had in retail in the Q3. How much is this linked to price mix and volumes? And on volumes, I was interested in knowing whether from your research, you can understand how much of this volume growth comes from new customers, so your ability to attract new consumers, thanks to the visibility and everything.


Unknown Executive

[Interpreted] Paola, I'll try and take your question. We always claim that tomorrow, we should be known less than today. And this is what exclusivity means. Yes, things are going well. The Fall-Winter collection was -- received positive feedback in July, and now it's very -- looks very good in stores. And the same went for the summer collection. You see when you come and visit where the collection is presented, you can really realize. When at the start of the season, you disclose your collection if it receives good feedback, you see it matters.

So we are going back to the great value of the product. This is very important. you can't always design your best collection. But if you do listen, you can change. When you go back home, you must have the courage to change something because maybe you see this part where a section was not appreciated that much. So Paola, we can say that taste, style, brand exclusivity, it seems that it is garnering quite a good success.


Operator

[Interpreted] Next question, Flavio Cereda, GAM.


Flavio Cereda

[Interpreted] So I would like to ask you some sort of abstract question. So we said 2 million pieces and revenues split between retail and multi-brand. So in the past, I did buy your products online and offline at a discount. I remember Century 21 at New York, sometimes they had nothing, sometimes they had 10, 20 items. Then I stopped because every time I bought something, then Riccardo was teasing. We say, well, these goods -- these items you're wearing is six collections ago, six collections old.

But if we actually make the math, and given that you are in clothing, so seasonal product, numbers -- so it is true that multi-brands will not sell everything. So something will be sold at a discount, but numbers are so small compared to production that in my opinion, the concept of exclusivity is not -- definitely is unscathed there because we are talking about very limited and occasional quantity. But do you really mind -- this is my question. Do you care or do you do something, or the quantity is so small that you do not do anything?


Brunello Cucinelli
Executive Chairman & Creative Director

[Interpreted] Well, on the behavior, you see we never say anything about the major names in multi-brands because they know they basically lose if they do something like that. If Lane Crawford, if they sell something at a huge discount, their image is blemished. So if BRAUN or Unger in Germany, if they sell something at a huge discount, they jeopardize their own image. That's why I say that I never came across anyone who was willing to basically jeopardize their image. Of course, 1 year it's the miniskirt, the second year is the long skirt. So if you have six miniskirts, the second season, you sell them at a discount. So that's why you will find more ladies clothing than men's because ladies are very seasonal.

If you do not sell this miniskirt by -- at the end of that month, that's it. But thank you for your question. Multi-brand is my passion. You should -- you can always trust -- you must always trust the feedback of the multi-brands. I never trust what our store managers say when they say, wow, it's beautiful, it's great. No, it's up to the multi-brands to say -- to have me say thank you.

[Operator Instructions].


Unknown Executive

[Interpreted] So there seems to be no further questions. We'd like to thank you immensely. And -- so the reason why we brought the conference call forward was, yes, to provide you with the preliminary data, but also to tackle this issue. Of course, had it not happened, it would have been felt better. But this is the rule of the games. So best greetings, best wishes.

But one last thing. So we were sitting at the bar once and a foreigner turned up, and he was really dealing the best cars. He was really great at playing cards. So he stayed at our local cafe for 3 or 4 days, and he won and counted and deceived everybody, not me because I refused point blank to play with him. But you see this is the rule of the game, and we tend to comply with it. So it was plus 50% on our first trading day. And so this means that these are the rules. You go -- there are ups and downs. Thank you very much.


Operator

[Interpreted] This is the end of the conference call. You can now disconnect your phones. Thank you.
