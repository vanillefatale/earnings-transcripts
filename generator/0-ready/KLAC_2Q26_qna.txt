Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.

Vivek Arya
BofA Securities, Research Division

For the first one, your forecast for WFE for this year. Yesterday, your peer reported and suggested that WFE could grow over 20%. I think they said 23%, and you're suggesting something in the high singles to low double. So I was hoping you could clarify what is kind of the apples-to-apples inclusion or exclusion. And then part of that, you're suggesting advanced packaging only grows, I think, in that same pace, high single to low double. But that's very surprising given how fast the AI market is growing and just the correlation of that advanced packaging market to AI. So basically, if you could just give us apples-to-apples, why such a big disconnect between your view of WFE growth versus what your peers suggested yesterday?

Bren Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

Vivek, it's Bren. So I did talk about this a little bit in the letter, but I think one of the issues that has become a little bit noisy over the last couple of years has been the rise of advanced packaging as a market. And the inclusion of it in WFE forecast, I think, you and I talked about this in your conference back in June was that who -- what do people exactly include in these numbers and it varies a little bit across analysts and across companies.

If you look at our forecast, our view on consistent traditional core WFE in 2025, was around approximately, and we'll see how people report, but approximately $110 billion and that the advanced packaging market, as we look at it, the total market is roughly in that $11 billion range. So we'll call it the low $120 billion. As we look at 2026, looking at it in the same way, we see advanced packaging growing somewhere in excess of $12 billion. So it will probably be in double digits. We'll see. It tends to be a quicker turn business.

So we'll see how that plays out. And that core WFE is rising from $110 billion, as we said, to about somewhere in the low 120s. So I think when you add the two together, you end up in the mid-130s, which is, I think, consistent with what Lam said yesterday. But that's how to think about the market. I don't know how they think about it and what they include and what they don't. We try to capture all elements of the market as it relates to process and process control, and so that's how we look at it overall in terms of what happens on the wafer, film frame, advanced component and so on. So that's how we see it. Hopefully, that helps.

Richard Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

And one, Vivek, Rick, just to add one part of that. The question on the growth of packaging, we're talking to our customers, they are frustrated with the shelves that they have available. So part of what's slowing down the growth this year is their ability to have their factories built to support packaging because of the growth. So that's why we see it more -- we'll see a lot more growth in '27 as a result of that. There is demand, but I think it's a matter of getting the facilities ready, which is a theme generally right now with our customers.

Bren Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

So I think on the go forward, we're just going to aggregate it. And I think maybe that helps. But what I tried to do is provide over the last several months or so, some disaggregation -- disaggregated view of what's traditional core WFE, the same WFE we looked at over the last multiple decades and what the advanced packaging market looks like as you add the two together, and you get to the mid-130s as we look at 2026.

Vivek Arya
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. And for my follow-up, just kind of two clarifications. One is, what's your assumption of China WFE kind of absolute percentage growth, how much was China WFE is part of that $120-plus billion in your definition, kind of all in WFE, how much was China? And then what are your assumptions about what China would do this year? And then how much are your supply constraints limiting your growth? Is there a way to quantify, right, how much growth you're kind of leaving on the table because of your -- where are those supply constraints? And how much are they limiting your growth this year?

Richard Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

All right. There's a lot in there. For China, our expectation is that China is flattish, maybe slightly positive, modest growth in 2026. It was modestly negative in 2025. For the company as a percent of our revenue, we think it will be somewhere in the mid-20% to high 20% range as we look at it. I think if you look at the total China WFE inclusive of the restricted fabs, we see China somewhere in the, we'll call it, in the mid maybe -- mid-$30 billion range -- mid- to high $30 billion range in 2026.

Vivek Arya
BofA Securities, Research Division

Anything on supply constraints?

Bren Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

Look, I think as it relates to the first half, we're virtually sold out across most of our products. Given the lead time of our products, our decisions that we're driving in the first half were decisions we made in the middle of 2025 generally. As we move into the second half and as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we see the second half accelerating versus the first half. We have a little bit more flexibility. But there are constraints in terms of what our customers are asking for. We're seeing our lead times extend. There are facility readiness dynamics that will play a role in terms of timing of shipments.

The one good thing is that given all the new facility or greenfield visibility we have is it does give us pretty good confidence as we look out into 2027. And most of our conversations today about new orders are for deliveries late in '26 and into '27. So it's pretty clear from a visibility point of view, we feel pretty good about our ability to ramp the business. But if you look back to 2022, I think we did a pretty good job in terms of ramping to support a pretty robust environment. And so I think that those practices and our investments and how we manage our supply chain will play through in terms of our ability to satisfy demand as we look out over the next 12 to 24 months.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.

Harlan Sur
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Your core process control systems business delivered yet another strong year of WFE outperformance. I think it grew 20% versus 2025 WFE of like plus 10% to 12%. Within this inspection significantly outperformed yet again for like the third or I can't remember, fourth or consecutive year, growing 25% and patterning growing 12%. How are you guys thinking about the growth in inspection and patterning relative to overall WFE view of sort of low teens growth this year? I mean given the focus on yield and manufacturability, would you expect a similar level or more of outperformance in process control for calendar '26?

Richard Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

Yes, Harlan, it's Rick. Thank you. I think the -- recognizing the outperformance, I think, we're feeling really good about the trends that we're seeing, especially in inspection and especially as they relate to the BBP products. And to Bren's point, I think we've been trying to add capacity in that product line and probably we're going to need it based on our conversations with customers. So I think there'll be continued growth. And everything about what we're seeing in the build-out for AI, Bren talked about the increased designs, the larger die. And now what we're seeing in HBM, which has become a huge driver. In many ways, the bigger story is the change in intensity around memory has been pretty dramatic in terms of if we look back the last couple of years and heavy usage of advanced inspection to support that.

So it's good. I mean we're looking at a modeling as we go forward. And our customers have told us '26 is expansion and setting the stage for even more expansion than '27. And so we think we'll continue to see strong growth associated with that. I think that the capacity -- I mean, metrology is historically a little closer tied to some of the capacity. So we'll see some relative recovery. And then reticle is going to be very strong because it's so tied to the number of design starts and the challenges associated with advanced nodes. Bren, am I missing anything?

Bren Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I think to your question about relative performance, I think despite the more mix related to memory, as Rick talked about, our performance in HBM has changed in the intensity profile. And so we feel pretty good about our ability to sustain the multiyear outperformance that we've seen. So I think it's pretty exciting. The portfolio is in a really good place from an overall share point of view, and we're seeing intensity rise in a number of markets. So we feel pretty good about it.

Harlan Sur
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. And for my follow-up, it's pretty well understood that on all these new sort of advanced technology transitions you do need a lot more inspection and metrology capabilities right. But on top of that, given the industry's chip supply tightness, your customers are looking to even further squeeze more supply for a given sort of current installed base. I'm wondering, is this -- and so their focus just as much on technology transition, but on the existing capacity footprint trying to drive more supply via yield improvement, better manufacturability. I'm wondering if this is also driving incremental demand for your process control solution?

Richard Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

Yes, certainly. I mean we have seen, in some cases, back penetration of technologies once the recognition was that -- two things have happened. In some cases, if you go back in time, they'd move from one technology to the next and not really pay much attention to the prior. Now there's more demand at the prior and if they're getting advantages in the capabilities and the latest technology node, we see back penetration to squeeze out, to your point, more yield. Right now, because of the constraints, and I think if you -- when we talk to all our customers, we hear a common theme is they're constrained by the ability to build new fabs and new shelves. So to your point, they are for the most part everything they can to optimize. And then the pricing environment is such for them that, that additional yield is worth for. And so that's the other factor that's driving them.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Joseph Quatrochi with Wells Fargo.

Joseph Quatrochi
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Maybe just want to kind of understand the supply constraints that you're seeing in the first half. Any way that you can kind of help us understand just what could growth has potentially kind of been first half versus second half if you didn't have those supply constraints? And then is it mostly just DRAM? Or is it also other components like optics and things?

Bren Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

Well, Joe, the biggest long lead time aspect of our build of material is an optical component. So to my earlier point about the lead time for that tends to be pretty long. So that does -- we -- like I said, we were making decisions last summer that was affecting what we expect to ship in the first half of the year. So that's probably the biggest factor. We don't really look at what we could have done. Certainly, in the last few months, we've seen a strengthening from customers for more demand in the first half. And so I mean, the good thing about our differentiation in our market position is that we can balance pretty well across our customers to make sure that we're trying to meet their needs. At the same time, we're not missing business or losing business. So our lead times are extending. Our customers know that. And so we're managing it accordingly.

So I don't -- but I don't think I go, "Oh, I could have done this or could have done that. It's what can you do?" And so I think that that's the nature of our conversations with customers and then we look to improve as we can. As we move in the second half of '26, we'll see the business accelerate. I would expect second half to have high single, maybe low double-digit type growth as we move into the second half of the year.

Richard Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

I think as an industry, you have to remember, if we moved independently, if we could supply everything everybody wanted right away, it still would be a limit. There are other factors that limit their ability to ramp these fabs. So our customers, when we talk to them are having the same conversation with our peers that they're having with us because collectively, they need all the equipment in order to be able to ramp. And so the frustration for a lot of them now is they've got demand. And in some cases, they don't even have the ability to build the shelves as fast as they want and then fill it out.

So to Bren's point, collectively, we're all being asked to accelerate equipment delivery, but it's not really -- because we don't have BBP that we're missing out as part of their overall solution. So when we talk to them, they really want to prioritize when they get that equipment to be able to facilitate it. But we're not going to lose share because of it.

Joseph Quatrochi
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, just trying to understand like the kind of trajectory of gross margin. I mean, it seems like maybe based on the guidance in March is kind of the bottom, and we move higher from here. And anything you can share on just the ability to like pass through higher component costs to reprice your backlog?

Bren Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So I think you're right. It looks like March is probably the low point for the year as that goes. And as we move across the year, we'll see an increment up. We're going to be -- our first priority as it relates to memory supply is securing supply to ensure that we can meet our delivery commitments and support our customers. That's our primary focus. We'd also expect that the tariff burden as we progress through 2026, given some of the process things we're doing within the company will also diminish in terms of its impact. I talked about a 50 to 100 basis point impact related to tariffs. We're closer to the top end of that range today, and we'll see that come down, I think, over time.

So as it relates, I thought it was important to give you some sense of it in terms of the expectations for the year, 62% plus or minus, 50 basis points. We think the memory situation is transitory. And really, as it relates to how we price our products, it's much more of a value-oriented pricing model and less about cost movement, particularly around commodity. So it's important that we continue to maintain the product cadence that we have in terms of launching new products and variants of new products. And that gives us an opportunity to enhance our cost of ownership offering to our customers, add new capability and also take into consideration some of these dynamics around costs that we've been dealing with for some time, starting with some of the pretty significant inflation just a few years ago to this issue today. So that's how we're thinking about it right now.

Operator

We'll take our next question from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald.

Christopher Muse
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

I guess first question on gross margins. How are you thinking about the progression through the year given the overall guide of 62%? And then more importantly, I guess, what are your thoughts around 2027 and the ability to kind of pass along the higher DRAM costs, which I don't assume will go away anytime soon. And I guess as you deliver kind of newer products, what impact should that have on incremental gross margins into next year?

Bren Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So over the course of the rest of this year, I think that margins -- look, product mix is probably the biggest factor in quarter-to-quarter variability, but I would expect gross margins to trend north, part of it being our expectations around mix here, but also expected increases in overall volume. So I think that there's some scale benefits that we'll see that will flow through.

Over the long run, I feel pretty comfortable with, as we talked about, our model that we presented at our last Investor Day of 63% plus type gross margin profile. I feel still very good about that. And given the mix of our business, the growth rates of service and so on. So I think as we look into 2027, I would expect to see gross margins continue on kind of an incremental cadence from where they are. And I feel pretty good about 63% plus as we go forward and we see some normalization in some of these cost areas.

Christopher Muse
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

Very helpful. And then I wanted to focus on DRAM. I think your share of wallet historically has been kind of 7%, 8%, 9% depending on the year. But curious now with HBM, particularly as we evolve to HBM 4 and 4E, how do you see that share kind of progressing in '26 and '27?

Richard Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

Sure. I think technologically, there's a lot of reasons to explain why we're seeing higher adoption. One, we've talked about before is less redundancy. The value of these devices is higher, so there's less willingness to give away real estate to redundancy. There is, because you've got to move so much data in and out, there's more metallization layers, which require more inspection. And then the increased use of the advanced lithography, which requires in EUV more inspection.

So all those things are driving up the intensity of DRAM, and it looks much more similar to what logic did not that long ago. So I think all those issues are driving that, and we feel really good about that going forward as we're engaging with customers and they're seeing the benefits of -- for many of them, they haven't been employing a lot of process control like this in most of their working lifetime. So we're seeing them getting used to that and coming to us for more capability.

Bren Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

I think the other thing is the process variability, flexibility in the past, depending on end market was something that customers could bin devices. And with high-performance compute, they don't have the ability to do that. So that's driving more rigor around ensuring that each of the devices in the stacks performs to pretty tight specs. The demand environment is also driving opportunities in our service business as customers look to keep these tools up to have maximum uptime to ensure good performance, where in the past with redundancy, you might see less contract penetration. We think it's a growth opportunity here moving forward given the nature of these devices and their requirements.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Shane Brett with Morgan Stanley.

Shane Brett
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

My first question, I just wanted to follow up on CJ's question earlier. But you previously talked about DRAM process control intensity increasing 100 basis points with EUV and another 100 basis points with HBM. But is there a world in which DRAM process control intensity just really gets close to advanced logic?

Bren Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

Well, it's still a ways away from advanced logic given the high mix of designs. And so that's, I think, the biggest issue that you see in advanced logic that's different than memory. So we're pretty encouraged by what we're seeing. We'll see how this plays out with more EUV layers and so on in DRAM devices. So we think that it's just the market requirements are driving more inspection, more metrology, and we think that will be a positive trend. I'm not sure I'm ready to commit to something that looks like advanced logic, just given the nature of those devices and the differences in a logic fab versus memory.

Shane Brett
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. And my follow-up is on foundry/logic. So you've called out a broadening of foundry customers over the last year, and it's clearly materializing with your customers' CapEx announcements. But could you talk about the process control intensity at these customers? And just how good can leading-edge logic for you be this year?

Richard Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

I'll start and then let Bren fill in. We are seeing the broadening. We're definitely seeing the intensity. I think to Bren's point, there's a couple of factors that you have to look at, maybe 3 really. One is the technology node and a big factor is die size and then another one is the mix. And so if you have a company that's doing advanced logic, but they're not on large die and they're not high mix, that intensity is just not going to be as high as if you have somebody that's doing all 3. But it's higher than it's been. And in order to be competitive, they're increasing it.

So we kind of model that going forward, and that's -- and we'll lay this out in a lot more detail when we look at our 2030 conversation at the Analyst Day. But we are seeing it going up for this year. And there's -- when we talk to our customers in advanced logic, even they are talking about, it depends. It depends on if they get more customers, it depends on how much more capacity they need, then their investments will follow based on that. So it's a little hard for us to judge what that's going to end up being.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.

Timothy Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Mid-single digits half-on-half versus the back half of last year. But I think you made a comment answering a question about high single digit.

Kevin Kessel
Vice President of Investor Relations

Tim, do you mind starting over? I think when you began your question, you were kind of like right in the middle, so we didn't pick up the start of the question. And I didn't want you to finish and then have to do it again, if you don't mind.

Timothy Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. Perfect. So Bren, we know you said the first half of this year is going to be up mid-singles versus the back half of last year. So we know what June is. June is like 3.6% and change. I think in answering a question, you said high singles to low doubles. And I think you meant the back half of the year. Is that a half-on-half comment because that would sort of imply that the calendar back half would be something like $7.5 billion. And like I asked because that's not up that much versus the $3.6 billion that you're saying for June.

Bren Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

Tim, yes, so that was a half-to-half statement. I said, so we'll see how it plays out, right? I'm not going to guide specifically with more detail. I tried to give you a sense of this -- our expectations of growth in the second half of the year. And I think it's likely in that sort of high single, low double range for now. So we'll see how things play out as we move forward.

Timothy Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. And then advanced packaging, I think unless I look back through the transcripts, I thought last quarter on the October call, I thought the expectation was that the advanced packaging market this year would grow more than 20%. And now I think you're saying mid- to high teens. Did the market downtick? Or did stuff pull in? Or maybe I'm just parsing numbers, but I'm just kind of wondering if like something changed.

Bren Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

No, we're pretty encouraged by what we're seeing in the market. It's not a large market, so the percentages can move around a fair amount. We're very encouraged by what we're seeing from a share point of view across the market. So we'll see. I tried to provide some context. I think it's likely in that, we'll call it, 10% to 20% range. And so that's why we said what we said. What's interesting about our process control position in that market, if you go back to 2021 in process control, we were roughly 10% of that market. That overall market was what I called a rounding error in terms of how you thought about WFE. But now as you look at the size of the market and the opportunity that's there, it is now becoming part of what's called -- what I think is this core overall equipment market.

Our share was down in the 10% range. I think when you look at 2025, we're close to half the market in share. And I think in 2026, we feel pretty good about our prospects moving forward. So it's a great opportunity. There's a lot of advancement that's happening there. Sampling rates are high. So -- and we have a broader portfolio that we think customers will start to leverage more as we move forward. So it's a pretty, I think, exciting market. And we have great drivers within what I call traditional WFE, and we have this evolving SAM that we think will augment our growth here moving forward.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research.

Christopher Caso
Wolfe Research, LLC

I guess first question would be characterizing the relative growth of memory versus foundry/logic for this year. And I recognize that a lot of that has -- probably has to do with clean room space constraints, as you said. But what -- how do you think it shapes up for this year and then particularly in the second half of the year as some of the revenue starts to improve?

Bren Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

We think that certainly, the DRAM part of the market will grow faster than foundry/logic will grow, driven mostly by the demand for HBM, but also, as we talked about, the challenges in conventional memory as well. So the way we're modeling is we think overall foundry/logic is up 10% to 15% for the year from a WFE point of view and that the DRAM part of the market is probably 15% to 20% versus last year. Flash, a little harder to pin. I think it's slower than DRAM. It's a lower -- it's a lower base, a lower number. But I think the biggest, at least from our point of view, I mean, certainly, the biggest drivers for WFE this year and from a growth point of view overall is what's happening in advanced logic and what we're seeing in the DRAM market.

Christopher Caso
Wolfe Research, LLC

As a follow-up, I think, you've talked about 12% to 14% kind of normalized service growth. Given the rising utilization rates, the fact that the folks are a bit tight now, how does that affect the service growth for both '26 and as you kind of start into '27?

Bren Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

Well, there's a number of factors that are driving growth. Certainly, to your point, I mean, higher utilization. I mean our tools tend to stay very well utilized no matter where customer overall utilizations are because it's the best way to manage capital even in downturns is to drive yield. So our customers in terms of how they buy our systems is they buy them, they run them at very high uptime. And the value is in the performance of the systems and matching performance in terms of information on defectivity and metrology and so on.

So the growth expectations of the growing installed base, this installed base living longer, opportunities for where things are tighter in the market, opportunities around memory, as I talked about earlier, opportunities in packaging. And then growing streams in our acquired businesses where we think we can leverage the infrastructure of KLA to drive revenue growth and service out of acquired businesses. Those are all our vectors for growth here moving forward. So we feel very confident about the 12% to 14% go-forward target model for service revenue. And I think there are a lot of drivers that suggest we can operate at the higher end of the range versus the lower over time.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.

James Schneider
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I was wondering if you can maybe provide a little bit more precision following on the last question. Do you expect that -- I mean, clearly, you expect DRAM to be stronger in the short term, but do you expect the growth in foundry/logic to actually expand substantially into the back half of the year such that those growth rates would be closer to matched or not? I'm just trying to think about how that plays out in terms of process control intensity for you over the course of this year.

Bren Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So I can't comment exactly on where the overall industry levels will be. I mean, certainly, as it relates to KLA's business, I would expect the foundry/logic part of our business to be kind of stronger in the second half than the first half right now. But it is -- I think it's pretty fluid and there's, I think, kind of consistent growth expectations, half to half across both segments.

Richard Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

Well, and we know from public comments some of our customers have made that they are definitely facility constrained, right? So their ability to ramp, I'm sure they're going to do everything they can to pull that in, but I think we're going to see in the foundry/logic space, the setup for '27 is pretty remarkable. And we'll see more, I think, late in '26 as they have the opportunity. But there's a lot of discussions already about preparing us, the equipment supply companies for '27.

James Schneider
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up, relative to the China market, you outlined your expectations for WFE growth there. But I'm wondering, in terms of your -- the competitive landscape, you have a very, very strong portfolio sort of across the board in your product space. Have you heard any kind of incremental interest from your customers in China or from the government in terms of promoting more onshore solutions there?

Richard Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

Well, I think that to the degree where we can compete, we continue to offer capabilities that customers want. I think the biggest constraint we have and the biggest challenge we have sometimes in China is when we're not permitted to sell, but alternative non-U.S. companies are permitted to sell to the same customers. And those are conversations we've had with the government.

We're not going to opine on those decisions overall of which companies are on that list. In terms of competition from China, I think there's been more progress made quite a bit more in the process tools than there has been in either lithography or in process control, partly -- largely because of the technology required to do that. So we feel pretty good about competing anywhere in the world, including China. And what we push for in the cases where we've had some unfair disadvantage is we just want a level playing field as it pertains to actions taken by the government.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.

Robert Mertens
TD Cowen, Research Division

This is Robert Mertens on the line for Chris. I know you've talked a good amount on some of the previous questions. But just in terms of these capacity constraints, are there any areas of the market that are larger pain points in your ability to ship tools to? And any areas where potentially you could be constrained and would need more capacity once foundry and logic takes off more in calendar year '27?

Richard Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

I mean if you think about -- this is Rick. If you think about our portfolio, we, by and large, ship the same products, same kind of products for advanced technologies, whether it's memory or foundry/logic. So it's not like we're constrained on to support the memory guys or the logic guys. It's more the thing Bren talked about where optics is an example where you only have so much capacity over time and you can add it, but you can't add it quickly because it takes a lot of work to increase the number of -- the output of very complex optics. So it's more product specific to our products than it is customer specific.

Bren Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

And I guess the only other thing I'd add to that is what's driving the market today is really leading edge demand. And so it isn't like we -- when we went through '23 and '24 with more legacy products where we had a broader mix of products. What customers want today are leading-edge solutions. And so that's where most of the focus is.

Robert Mertens
TD Cowen, Research Division

Got it. And then your DRAM shipments were particularly strong this quarter. I think you had mentioned in the last call, you expected them to be up. But were there any shifts in your view over the quarter? And what sort of demand visibility do you have into that market for this year?

Bren Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. As we said earlier, I mean, certainly, over the last few months, we've seen fundamentals of overall equipment spending strengthen and certainly a desire by our customers to get tools sooner rather than later. So we've tried to manage our way around that, and the demand is broad-based. So I would say that overall demand has strengthened in the last few months in that part of the market, the whole part of -- all markets, frankly.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.

Stacy Rasgon

For my first one, I want to ask Tim's question a slightly different way. So you gave the guidance for the first half, which kind of gives me June. And again, if I'm modeling, you said high single to low double, the second half would be up, call it, 10%. That would put -- my math suggests that kind of total revenue is up, I don't know, 12%, 13%, which is about what you're suggesting the whole WFE market is growing. So like you said you're gaining share. So why wouldn't that number be higher? Like where is the share gains given that half over half in the second half that you're talking about?

Bren Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

Well, so Stacy, I mean, part of this is the blended numbers, right? So you're getting that. When we talk about share gain overall, we're looking at our semiconductor process control business in terms of its relative performance against the total equipment market. So there is that. Again, I allow you to do the work. I'm not going to guide the full year to that level of precision. I will say that we feel very good about our ability to grow faster than the market. And you've got service element, you've got our non-semi elements that are also factors in our overall growth rate.

Stacy Rasgon

Okay. Because I mean services is growing about that much as well. You said 12% to 14%. And I just feel like that half over half, and maybe there's just conservatism built into it, but it feels like, like I said, call it, 10% or whatever feels light anyways. So my second question, just around China, the last time you reported, it was after the affiliate rule been put in place and before it was taken off. What are your thoughts on, I guess, recovery of that revenue? And like how does that bake in to your thoughts on China revenue next year? Because to my mind, like your -- I don't know if your China guidance for next year now is higher than it was last quarter or not, but presumably some of that affiliate revenue should be coming back?

Bren Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I would have -- I think back 3 months ago, we thought China would be modestly down, and now I think it's going to be up for us this year. So that business has come back in and feathered through within our forecast and some of the commentary we provided here.

Stacy Rasgon

And how much was that again? I can't remember, $300 million or $350 million? I can't remember.

Bren Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, in that ballpark. I mean some service elements, but yes, in that ballpark.

We do have time for one additional question. We'll take our final question from Tom O'Malley with Barclays.

Thomas O'Malley
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

As I look out, you talked about more share gains. Where should I be paying attention? Is that more on the leading-edge foundry/logic side? Is that more in the advanced packaging side? Just because to Stacy's question, right, like you're talking about a core WFE that you're growing in line with, maybe you're being a little conservative to start the year and end up beating that as we go along. But I would imagine if you include advanced packaging as well, that's an area where you've had a lot of strength. So I would imagine that would accelerate the growth rate. Maybe explain where you're seeing those share gains? Is it more so on the AP side or on the leading-edge foundry/ logic side?

Bren Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

Well, we're certainly seeing share gains in AP, as I talked about earlier. I think there's a lot of positive momentum there. I think we've done extremely well in logic, and I think there's a lot of momentum on the memory side. As it relates to the overall business, I wouldn't say our share is pretty consistent across the different segments. Mean so it really comes down to our products. So reticle inspection had a really strong year. We think that, that's part of the market is inflecting. We're doing pretty well there.

We see some positive momentum in our electron beam businesses. And so we think that, that's a positive here moving forward as well. So I think between what's happening in packaging, what's happening in e-beam, what's happening in reticle and our largest businesses like our broadband plasma business or high-end pattern inspection, it's a market that's growing faster, and we have a strong share. So it will influence the overall share numbers just because of the relative growth rate of that segment versus other parts of the market.

So those are the areas we feel pretty good about our share position here in 2025 in terms of gaining share. And we think that we'll continue to increment what was a really strong share position. We'll continue to increment here moving forward given the nature of the portfolio and our ability to compete, meeting customers' technical requirements and their cost requirements, being able to leverage the network effect across the systems. So we think that, that enhances our competitive offerings and positions us well here moving forward from a share point of view.

Thomas O'Malley

Super helpful. And if I may, just a really quick follow-up. Your competitor talked about the different vectors of market growth into their guidance for WFE in 2026 and said foundry/logic good growth, DRAM good growth, but NAND a bit below that. I was curious if you agree with that assessment when you look at the broader market. And then obviously, you're hearing some NAND guys report tonight maybe talking a bit more aggressively about spend. Do you think that as this year goes along, maybe that view can change if you see an acceleration a bit more quickly on the NAND side from a technology transition perspective or some greenfield capacity? I know it's a smaller business for you, but interested in your thoughts.

Bren Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

I think the challenge, given the constraints in the industry around how much can actually be supplied, any new demand that's showing up today, as I said earlier, in terms of our conversations with customers is more about '27 deliveries.

Richard Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

Also, they're not a competitor. They're a peer. We have enough competitors. Thank you.

Kevin Kessel
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Tom. All right. I wanted just to thank everyone for their time. I know it's a very busy earnings season and a very busy earnings day. We look forward to seeing hopefully many of you at our Investor Day in New York on March 12. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for any final instructions.

Operator
