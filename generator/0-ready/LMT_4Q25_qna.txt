[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Scott Mikus with Melius Research.

Scott Mikus
Melius Research LLC

Jim and Evan, I wanted to ask on capital deployment. You have the big step-up in CapEx for this year, and it seems like that's going to persist for the next few years. So are you changing your overall capital deployment strategy of returning 100% of free cash flow to shareholders following the President's executive orders? And if so, should investors expect that to be a new normal? And how might vertical integration factor into capital deployment going forward?

James Taiclet
Chairman, President & CEO

Scott, it's Jim. We're going to continue to use a disciplined and dynamic capital allocation process that we've been using for years. There's some differences this year, which is the introduction of these long-term contracts, which I do think will be extended and expanded by the Department of War, which creates stable growth opportunities for companies like us that the ROIs will exceed our cost of capital, and therefore, we should invest in those stable growth opportunities over much longer terms than we've ever enjoyed before. So the process remains the same, but the conditions have changed on the availability of accretive investments that we can make in our company.

The second area is R&D. And we are making inroads in a number of areas that, again, we believe with the new approach for acquisition transformation in the government, we will be able to prove ourselves by making R&D investments and building prototypes even at a greater rate than we ever have before. And I'll give you just a couple of examples of that. You saw one already, the autonomous Black Hawk helicopter, that's real. I mean it flies. You can control it from a tablet, command post or inside the aircraft, but where all the controls and all the intelligence are to fly using AI. You don't need a pilot in there. So we are doing this on our own R&D budget.

Another example is the CMMT, which is a low-cost, high-capability cruise missile design that we're creating ourselves because we do think there's going to be upside opportunity in that arena as the cost per unit will be attractive. And then finally, as far as the drone wingman, which we know how to actually control from F-22s and F-35 and designed the product to do that. We're building our own prototypes of the drone wingman CCA, if you will, again, on our own R&D budget because we think we will have the best product, we will get the scaled orders, and we can connect them and can show and have shown that we can connect our design of a CCA to a fifth-generation aircraft that actually flies today and that's a scalable opportunity for us.

So there'll be better and longer-term CapEx opportunities. There are more creative and open-field R&D opportunities for us. And as you mentioned, what's the vertical integration opportunity that may come throughout this administration and perhaps the next. We have been active in exploring and even attempting some mergers and acquisitions during the last 5 years. One that was publicized that wasn't approved by a different administration. So we're going to keep our powder dry for those opportunities, too, because they will be accretive as well.

So what we can say today is we are going to continue to use our disciplined and dynamic approach based on the conditions that we experienced in that period of time, and we're going to allocate our capital that way.

The next question comes from Rich Safran with Seaport Research.

Richard Safran
Seaport Research Partners

So, I have -- I think they're a quick two-part question on multiyears. First, regarding the two missile framework deals for PAC-3 and THAAD, what's the timing of a multiyear there? And how are you thinking about MFC margin potential over the long term? Second part, the F-35 has been mostly bought in annual increments and for the most part. Should we be expecting a multiyear for the F-35? And how are you thinking about program quantities there?

James Taiclet
Chairman, President & CEO

Rich, as far as the multiyear missile agreements, their frameworks, they are committed and purposeful by both sides, industry and government. There's a couple of other steps that government needs to take. One is to definitize the contract. And to do that, they need to have an appropriations that is approved. So they're working through and we will work through them on the definitized contract and RDR actually. But all those steps do need to be completed. The timing on that will be up to the congressional budget cycle. We expect both of those programs to be up and running under the framework agreement with appropriations by this year 2026. That's our expectation.

On F-35, we have been publicly advocating for a few years on multiyear sustainment, potential for aircraft like the F-35. There's no reason whatsoever that whether it's production, modernization and sustainment that those activities couldn't be wrapped into a multiyear framework just like we've done for the missile systems. Some additional complexity there given the nature of the program, but there's no reason we couldn't get to the goal line should the government be interested in pursuing any of or all of those elements of the F-35.

Evan Scott
Senior VP & CFO

And I'll address your question, Rich, on the MFC margins. So we, in our guidance this year, have contemplated the PAC-3 and THAAD multiyear agreements getting awarded this year with initial sales starting this year. So I think, first of all, it's encouraging to see margins holding despite growth beginning this year. I think as you know, the way we do our profit recognition is we start typically at a lower profit recognition point on a program and build it up over time as we make progress on deliveries and risk reduction. So think of this as a 7-year program that will step up over time.

What that would mean for MFC margins in the coming years is some possible dilution, but probably no more than 20 basis points to 30 basis points at max, but that's going to then create over time an opportunity to exceed MFC margins beyond where they have historically been with the opportunity to perform that is presented to us with these multiyear agreements.

James Taiclet
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. And that margin pressure, because of the start-up nature of this production ramping, will be in an environment where sales should be double-digit growth in MFC and maybe even mid-teens sales growth at MFC. We'll take that trade and then margins will, as Evan just said, will catch up. This is a very, very good arrangement for Lockheed Martin.

The next question comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley.

Kristine Liwag
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Jim, thank you for your earlier comments on R&D and capital priority. There's been growing interest in disruptive defense technologies and large established companies are often discussed and valued differently than newer entrants in this space. How do you think about technology disruption? Are there areas where you still see yourself as lightspeed ahead of industry? And how do you view your role within the broader defense innovation ecosystem?

James Taiclet
Chairman, President & CEO

Kristine, we address disruptive technology opportunities literally every day in every business area we have. And so I'll just give you a couple. And by the way, with the geopolitical environment that faces the United States today, we need to marshal all resources in American industry. So it could be the start-up community, it's the midsized companies, it's the new entrants, if you will. It's the capital markets. And the major aerospace and defense companies have to have a large role in this because you've got to have the infrastructure, you got to have the workforce, you have to have the cyber capability, you have to have the deployability around the world of anything you develop in the national defense arena in the United States. So we are all involved at every level and every BA in disruptive technology. And I'll just give you a couple of examples, start at the highest level, if you will, in Space.

We've already announced that we're building an operable space-based interceptor that we want to fly in space by 2028 that would be part of Golden Dome potentially that can actually incorporate our technology of how to hit, as my Chief Engineer says, a bullet with a bullet in space, but do it from space. That guidance technology, the ability to build the fins, the actuators, the electronics to actually make that happen, we know in this company how to do. We also know how to build satellites and also low-orbit satellites that we just described on the Tracking Layer, where we have a $1 billion contract to do military hardened low-orbit satellites already. So for us, it's a matter of being creative and combining our capabilities within Lockheed Martin and outside of Lockheed Martin. right? So if you -- if any initiative in this space doesn't have military theater level scalability, it's interesting, but it will not be decisive. We are in the business of decisive military advantage.

And so I'll give you another example. And this is teaming with a new entrant. The company is called Saildrone. Many of you have heard of that, distributed naval vehicle surface company, pretty advanced, very well run, excellent base product. But it will be interesting to have surface ship drones sailing around the Pacific. But to make them decisive in deterring a potential aggressor's action, they're going to have to be armed and they're going to have to be effectively armed with a reliable kind of weapon, frankly. And we're doing that with Saildrone.

We've actually innovated ourselves and took a JAGM, which is a joint air-to-ground missile, so generally fired from a helicopter, for example. We've taken this air-to-ground missile. We've reconfigured it to be a ground-to-ground missile or a surface-to-surface missile if you're on the ocean. That we did ourselves. We've built and invented a quad launcher that will take four of these JAGMs and be able to fire them not in a vertical angle, but at a 45-degree angle, which is also new to that system. And we're installing them as partners with Saildrone on their autonomous ships.

Now you've got something that can affect the deterrence equation of a potential adversary. And these are the kinds of things that we innovate on. How do we combine our own capabilities that I just described in Space? And another example, how do we combine our capabilities with a proven product that the Navy actually knows how to use and has supply chain for and has a repair system for already that we can introduce onto a new vehicle that no one's ever had before, which would be the Saildrone drone autonomous shipping. So we're all about disruptive technology. Some we'll do on our own. Some we'll do with our aerospace and defense kind of prime partners. Some we'll do with smaller and more novel companies.

The next question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein.

Douglas Harned
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

I want to go back to Missiles and Fire Control and a couple of things around the PAC-3 and the THAAD deals. I mean this is clearly very good in terms of allowing you to plan for the long-term and long-term growth. But if I put this into kind of a context of history, first, appropriations are still done annually in Congress. And there are periods of time, and you all saw this back kind of in the 2015 time frame when there was huge growing demand for missiles. And then things changed and that all collapsed. And so how do you get comfortable about that 7-year ramp that the support will be there? And if I can extend it a little bit, do you see the opportunities on some of the other MFC programs that you have underway to do a similar thing?

James Taiclet
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Doug, Jim here. Yes. Traditionally, there's been annual appropriations. The administration is striving to modify that. They've already got authorization for a range of factors or missiles through Congress part of the process, not the complete process. But it's already been introduced and it's advancing on a 7-year basis for, I think it's four or five specific missile systems, including THAAD and PAC-3. So that's the first confidence builder.

The second one is that the agreements that we have struck, and we were the pathfinder in these framework agreements. Others may sign on to something similar. But in our agreements, we had ensured with the department, as I alluded to earlier, that if there is a change in the procurement strategy, along the way during the 7 years, there are make-whole provisions that will bring our company back to sort of the same ROI, cash flow perspective as we would normally have had in a single year appropriation. So there is a remediation element to -- and a strong remediation element to make-whole if the procurement strategy changes.

The next question comes from Rob Stallard with Vertical Research.

Robert Stallard
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Jim, a question for you following up from Scott's question early on. I just wanted to clarify, will you be holding the buyback and dividend this year and going forward? Or is it coming down?

James Taiclet
Chairman, President & CEO

So we will be evaluating all of our capital deployment options as time progresses. We'll announce those decisions as they occur publicly as required and has been our practice. So we will be continuing to operate in a dynamic way. It's actually more dynamic than ever these days. And the opportunity set is much greater along the lines that I've already described. So Rob, we will disclose when we can what our actions are as the months progress through 2016 and beyond.

The next question comes from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen.

Gautam Khanna
TD Cowen, Research Division

I was wondering if you could give us a quick refresher on how the Aero classified program is performing. And also, Evan, if you could just speak to 2027 pension requirements given where things sit today?

James Taiclet
Chairman, President & CEO

So on the Aero classified program, this is Jim speaking. As a reminder, this is a very complex design and system integration activity and risk is going to remain over the next few years as we progress through more key phases of the program, which is progressing well. However, to note, there were no additional charges reported on this program in the fourth quarter, and we continue to proactively monitor and manage potential risk with our highest level of executives personally involved in this now. And we will keep such a close eye on the program that we should be able to identify any other potential risk and opportunities even to drive better outcomes on a much more timely basis. So that's where the program stands today. We're very confident in it. We're very confident in the team that we have on the field now to execute it, and it's being monitored monthly as never before.

Evan Scott
Senior VP & CFO

And I'll address the pension. And it's important to note when it comes to free cash flow, I think you've seen in 2025 and now in 2026, I think we've done a very good job with a lot of focus to convert working capital to operating cash. So between the 2 years, you do see a significant uplift in operational cash. What that meant in 2025, of course, is that we have ability to prefund the required 2026 pension in full such that there's no required this year, to your question. That requirement does come back starting in 2027 of at least $1 billion depending on how we look in terms of pension performance this year. I think with the strong cash flow that we're seeing this year, we'll continue to be opportunistic as we have in prior years. If we could drive free cash flow to such a way again this year, there may be an opportunity to prefund 2027's required pension as well. So we'll continue to stay focused on that and advise as we make progress.

The next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research.

Myles Walton
Wolfe Research, LLC

Jim, on last quarter's call, I think we talked about R&D and CapEx as a percent of sales. And at the time, you didn't see a need for that to rise materially. But obviously, that's changed here in the release. I think I understand the CapEx side for a capacity build-out, but what changed specifically in terms of opportunity set? Was it SBI or something else that drove the change in R&D as a percent of sales? And are these new numbers the new norms going forward? Or would they go higher?

James Taiclet
Chairman, President & CEO

So what's changed, Myles, is the department's very transparent interest in advanced technology development and to support advanced technology development. As the defense budget rises and Congress and the administration work together to decide exactly what those numbers are. But as it rises, there will be more opportunity for companies like ours to engage in more R&D type prototype activities. We've actually been doing that to the level you've seen us do for the past 3 or 4 years. And we actually have an entire process that goes from scientific level of research all the way through prototypes on active ships, Air Force Marine bases, test ranges. We've got that process in place now and have developed it over the last few years with our customers actually who do trust us in these matters. And now that we see that the budget could increase in this realm that the leadership of the research and development staff in the Pentagon is in place and that the commitment is to be innovative, we are going to commit more to R&D.

The next question comes from Mike Ciarmoli with Truist Securities.

Michael Ciarmoli
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

First, Evan, just a housekeeping. Should we expect the share count to stay flat or go down this year? And then, Jim, I was wondering if you could elaborate, maybe even tying into Myles' question. You talked about $1 billion strategic investment on F-35 sustainment. Can you maybe give us a little bit more detail and unpack that, what the expectations are? Was that maybe at the direction of the government? Or any more color there would be helpful.

James Taiclet
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So the share count will be reported quarterly as always. So you'll see that as it comes over the course of this year. On F-35 sustainment, over, I'll say, a few prior years, there was, in our opinion, some underfunding of spare parts and repair capacity in the various defense budgets previous to this administration. And we have been striving to make up for some of that ourselves with internal investment. But what we want to do is really kind of double down on our -- and frankly, we have put $1 billion plus into spare parts and repairs already, but we're going to double down on that to make an extra effort to improve the mission capable rates of the aircraft and kind of make up for this unfortunate spare parts and repairs deficit that's been created over the last 4, 5, whatever years. That's just something we're going to step up and do. It does require investment. But these systems are so critical in today's world that we do feel that we are going to get benefit both financially and operationally on the performance of the aircraft for making this investment. So we're going to do it.

Evan Scott
Senior VP & CFO

And I'll note that this elevated investment, as I think it's clear, is considered within that $6.5 billion to $6.8 billion free cash flow, which is higher than our previous guidance even with these elevated investments. So I think that speaks to the underlying strong operational cash flow.

Operator

The next question comes from Gavin Parsons of UBS.

Gavin Parsons
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

A quick clarification on cash flow first. Is there any customer support or CapEx reimbursement in your operating cash flow? And then on the PAC-3 and THAAD frameworks, could you talk a little bit more about how those are structured, maybe particularly as it relates to kind of the performance opportunity versus risk?

Evan Scott
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So with respect to cash flow and CapEx, one of the key dynamics of these multiyear agreements is that they're in no way intend to be punitive. This is a customer partnering with us to find the best, most efficient way to rapidly scale capabilities to the war fighter. And as such, I think we're going to see some partnership with cash flow terms to make sure that we're well supported as we make these investments. So I think you are going to see an elevated working capital benefit or operational benefit to offset some of these CapEx expenditures. So that is a key part of what we're contemplating with these deals.

James Taiclet
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. And then there's incentives in both the Patriot and the THAAD framework agreements for us to outperform the objectives. And so what we have agreed upon is a profit sharing above a certain robust level, I'll call it, where we start to share some of the increased profits with the U.S. government by plowing some of those increased profits back into something like I just talked about, which is additional spare parts or it's additional equipment or tooling in the factory, those kinds of things. And so there's a sort of reinvestment mechanism and a profit sharing vehicle, if you will, for us to even better support these programs going forward on behalf of -- and with the government.

Maria Lee
VP, Treasurer & Investor Relations

Great. And Sarah, I think we have time for one last question as we're approaching time here.

Operator

Your last question will come from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.

Sheila Kahyaoglu
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

In the past, Jim, maybe you've talked about a target framework with low single-digit revenue growth to mid-single digits and 10 basis points to 20 basis points of margin expansion. In light of what we've seen recently with PAC-3 and THAAD, double-digit growth at MFC is inevitable. So how do you think about the target growth model and maybe the segment ranking through that outside of MFC and free cash flow contribution going forward?

James Taiclet
Chairman, President & CEO

So Sheila, we do see upside to growth both, again, once we get things ramped up and margin compression out of the way. But certainly on revenues and then to follow on margins and certainly on operating profit as well. So we do see upside there. I could turn it over briefly to Evan just to talk a little bit about each of the business areas quickly.

Evan Scott
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So underlying, I think, to Jim's point, there's a strong growth paced by MFC. Space continues to be our second fastest-growing business now as we've seen strength in the strategic missile defense business, particularly, but also in the classified space area. So I think -- and with respect to MFC, we are scaling other munitions beyond the ones that we're contemplating in these multiyear agreements. So all across the board there, I think you're seeing strong revenue growth. As we look kind of beyond, I mean, we're not ready to give multiyear frameworks at this point, but I do think you're going to continue to see upward pressure on revenue and our real intention to drive margins. And in the next couple of years, we still have some dilutive pressure of some of the programs that we took prior losses on. So as those sort of work down, there's going to be, I believe, increased margin opportunity in the out years. And as time goes, we'll give added insight into that.

James Taiclet
Chairman, President & CEO

All right. Well, thanks for joining our call today, everyone. 2025 was a successful year for Lockheed Martin, and we're already carrying that momentum into 2026. As the war department continues to adopt new ways of doing business, I am more confident than ever in our company's ability to deliver both value to our military services and our allies and to our shareholders. I'd like to thank our 121,000 Lockheed Martin teammates for their commitment and dedication to the mission, and I look forward to speaking with all of you in April for our first quarter earnings call.

Sarah, that concludes our call for today.
