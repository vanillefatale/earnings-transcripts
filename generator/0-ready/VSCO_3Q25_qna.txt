Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions] For our first question, we will go to the line of Mauricio Serna with UBS.


Mauricio Serna Vega
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

First, could you elaborate a little bit more on how are you maintaining the momentum so far post the Fashion Show? And just give a little more detail on initiatives that you're thinking as you look into the startup of '26 just to maintain like the momentum around the brand. And generally speaking, I guess, where do you see the market share opportunities in bras and beauty, particularly with the comment about PINK intimate returning to growth.


Hillary Super
CEO & Director

Mauricio, I'll take that one. Momentum post Fashion Show, we are still in the halo of the Fashion Show. We see it in our traffic, which has been very, very strong in both channels. Particularly in stores, we're seeing it much stronger than the balance of the mall. And internationally, we're seeing just incredible momentum. That is led and grounded by bras and sexy and glamor. And so the messaging from the Fashion Show and the work that we've done to really build a sharp brand point of view is paying off.

The initiatives are the initiatives in the Path to Potential. We continue to focus on those categories. We are incredibly pleased with the progress we've made in top and bottom line, in increased market share and in the growth of our customer file, particularly from new and reactivated customers and customers that are coming in on higher AURs and are being compelled by brand and product and not necessarily by deals. So all of that feels really good and feels like things we can continue to play forward and double down on in the future.

As we enter 2026, we have a full pipeline of innovation in the bra world in particular as well as in the beauty world. We are building on what we've learned from partnerships and collaborations in PINK. PINK -- we did well, as we said, with LoveShackFancy, very, very pleased with that. And there are many things that we have in the future that we can apply those learnings to as well as PINK in the Fashion Show was a big surprise for us. The partnership with TWICE and the virality of that moment and how it impacted our PINK business, it was new news for us. And we quickly played that forward and impacted the first quarter of next year. So lots to be excited about here. And with all cylinders firing on our four key pillars, we feel very well positioned for 2026.


Mauricio Serna Vega
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Got it. Just a quick follow-up on the part of promotions. Maybe could you elaborate on strategies in place to keep pulling back on promotions? And how much is this lever contributing to gross margin expansion?


Scott Sekella
Chief Financial and Operating Officer

Mauricio, it's Scott. I'll take that one. So yes, we continue to pull back on promotions. We saw a good benefit to our gross margin in Q3, and that's even net of some increases in GWPs. And as we've talked on prior calls, having GWPs as a lever to provide value for customers as we pull back on promos, we've had a lot of success through that. While our promotional level is going to be much more similar in Q4 year-over-year, we have utilized the GWPs in a way where we've increased the amount that triggers the GWP, and we've seen great success in the Q4 and the Black Friday period with that. The demand through our stores was very, very strong for those GWPs and giving customers to come in with a much higher average order value. And as we've talked, promotions will be a multiyear journey. So we'll continue to find these opportunities to drive more regular price selling, pull back on full box promotions and continue to be more about emotion versus promotion, as Hillary said.


Mauricio Serna Vega
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Great. Congratulations on the results.


Scott Sekella
Chief Financial and Operating Officer

Thank you.


Hillary Super
CEO & Director

Thank you.

Our next question comes from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs.


Brooke Roach
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Hillary, I wanted to talk a little bit more about the change in rate of new customer acquisition that you're seeing this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the profile of those customers? Are they younger? Are they higher income? What are you seeing across your brands, particularly in North America? And what drives your plans for marketing as a result as you look ahead into '26?


Hillary Super
CEO & Director

Brooke, happy to answer that question. So customer acquisition and reactivation is something that we are extremely focused on and very excited about. And happy to report that we are seeing it distorted to 18- to 24-year-olds. So that was our goal. We are seeing that come to life. I would also add that they're coming in on a higher AUR. So we feel like the quality -- and we noticed anecdotally from interactions in stores that customers are coming in with their phones and showing videos and content, whether it's LoveShack, whether it's Better than Braless, whether it's Fashion Show content, they're bringing their phones in and saying, "I need this". And that is the ultimate goal rather than, I want this price point.

And so we feel really good about that. In terms of the cohorts, we're seeing growth across all cohorts, maybe a slight uptick in higher income customers on the growth side. But I do want to just add that I know a big question has been how are all income cohorts doing. I'll just take this moment to say that we are seeing consistent positive performance across all income cohorts. And we're really pleased with that and feel like that's a real proof point as we move forward.


Brooke Roach
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Great. And then just a follow-up for Scott. Historically, the business had targeted a low double-digit EBIT margin profile. Is this rate achievable in your view? And how are you thinking about the potential pace of expansion, offset by any reinvestment to continue the positive comp momentum?


Scott Sekella
Chief Financial and Operating Officer

Yes. So we definitely still see a low double-digit operating margin as achievable. I think the question is when over the next couple of years. The margin has continued to expand, number one, as we grow. And we've talked about we have that low leverage point for both our buying and occupancy expenses but also our SG&A. So as we grow north of 1% to 2%, we're going to expand margin. That's still going to allow us to make select investments back into the business, in particular, in marketing. We've had success with some of that where we've seen positive ROAS opportunities. And we'll continue to take advantage of those. But even taking advantage of those, we feel like we can get back to that low double-digit operating margin over the next couple of years through our Path to Potential growth strategy.

Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays.


Adrienne Yih
Barclays PLC

And really great to see the stores, the product, the brands really turning. Hillary, I guess on that, the fall of this year, we really started to see that bra focus and the franchise bra focus is kind of calling out those products. And it kind of reminded me of kind of historically when Victoria's Secret would regularly come to market with bra launches. And so I'm wondering kind of what do you have in the pipeline for 2026 to keep that going?

And then on PINK, sort of more at the high level kind of from a trend perspective, it does feel like -- and maybe I'm wrong here, but it does feel like we're kind of in a little bit of a retro, maybe like with the tracksuits coming back, some of that kind of juicy look that's sort of like very good for PINK. So I'm wondering if you can talk about some of that, that's happening.

And then, Scott, really kind of want to talk about kind of the multiyear opportunity. We're sitting at a mid-single-digit op margin. You just talked about a 10% opportunity. Promos are inflecting. And really wanted to just kind of understand where we are in that merch margin journey. It seems like we're in the very, very early signs of that with some good underpinnings for long term.


Hillary Super
CEO & Director

Okay. I will take those first couple of questions. So bras, bras franchises and launches, yes, you're right. Extremely important. And we have been uber, uber focused on our innovation pipeline and our strategy around bra launches and have several in the pipeline next year for both brands. But the point that I want to make here is an unlock that we had in with the FlexFactor launch and throughout Q3 was that we were able to have a successful launch and continued growth across all bras. And that was a change for us.

We, in recent history, have had a number of successful bra launches but often with a softening of the bras around it. And that was not the case this quarter. And I really credit our full funnel marketing strategy for that, that was able to talk about multiple things at one time and communicate our full breadth of range and wearing occasions. And we saw major payback for that. And we creatively and emotionally connected with the customer in a way that just drove outsized traffic. So feeling great about the learnings there, feeling great about what's in the pipeline and very confident that this is just the beginning of bra growth for us as a total company.

PINK and trend, yes, I think, well, trends are cyclical. We're definitely seeing a number of trends that harken back to those early days of PINK. We always want to put a modern spin on it. But that's just one part of PINK's opportunity. We are seeing outsized growth in apparel but also saw incredible improvement in both panties and bras, and that was a bit of a surprise to me. I was thinking that the opportunity was primarily in apparel, accessories and beauty for PINK. But we've seen that with the right cadence of fashion newness, we can drive growth across all categories in PINK, which is an extremely exciting learning and something that we're running with.

I would also point to partnerships and collaborations as a lever that we have across the entire brand. And those take various forms, sometimes as big as LoveShack, sometimes much smaller with an influential person that we're collaborating with. Sometimes it's an item rather than an entire collection. So you'll see us dipping our toe into a lot of those different things, but we have clearly seen the power of getting the product right, getting the brand heat right. And having the right media strategy to get that in front of the right audiences is the winning ticket here, and we intend to run with those strategies forward.


Scott Sekella
Chief Financial and Operating Officer

Adrienne, it's Scott. Taking the last part of your question and building upon Brooke's question as well, you mentioned promos inflecting, and that's absolutely the case we've been seeing and going to continue to see. But a couple of points to just solidify that. AURs in Q2, we talked about we're up 1%. But when you exclude panties, they were up 8%. This quarter, as I mentioned on the call, AURs were up 3% and, excluding panties, they're up 6%. So that's both pulling back in promotions but also driving more full-price selling.

In Q4, I do expect AURs to be up probably not to the same degree because it's a heavier promotion quarter, as you know. But that sort of momentum from Q2, Q3 will definitely carry into next year. And again, it's not just promos coming, but it's driving more of our mix into regular price selling. And one sort of anecdote on that, building upon the momentum we have with PINK and as Hillary was talking about, particularly PINK apparel. PINK apparel, we're seeing double-digit increases in AURs right now because we're driving that newness in that more regular price selling. And so that's going to help build these margins getting back to that double-digit operating margin over the long term.

Our next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.


Matthew Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats on a nice quarter. So Hillary, could you speak to the inflection in your performance relative to intimates category growth as we think about market share capture relative to larger picture category trends in the U.S. or globally? And then near term, could you just help break down the cadence of your monthly comps like you saw in the third quarter, particularly October, or the exit rate and just elaborate on the strong start that you cited to the fourth quarter, maybe relative to 8% comps in the third quarter or relative to second half of the quarter or October? Have you seen any change in momentum or demand?


Hillary Super
CEO & Director

Do you want to take that one first?


Scott Sekella
Chief Financial and Operating Officer

Yes, I'll take the last one first. So we saw a strong performance through the entire third quarter, started off with PINK Friday in the LoveShackFancy collab. That momentum sustained into September, particularly as we had a Very Sexy launch later in August and then a sort of a sport reset in September. But then the comps really amplified in October with the Fashion Show, particularly in the back half and sort of the virality of both shoppable collections, but also even the PINK and the Wear Everywhere bras. So that momentum we've seen sustained into November through the Black Friday selling period.

We are, though, cautious as we get sort of post holiday, will we see a broader consumer pullback. And so that's contemplated sort of in our Q4 thinking right now. But the momentum from the Fashion Show has definitely carried through November into this early December selling period. But I'll let Hillary take the first couple.


Hillary Super
CEO & Director

Okay. So bra performance, intimate performance versus total market share performance, I think what we have learned is that we can continue to perform and grow market share despite the market. And just as a point of reference, we are the #1 market shareholder. We all know that. But the next closest is about 8 points less than us. So we really have -- we have a hold on this market. And when we execute well and when we connect emotionally with the customer and really talk about our innovation and the value we add to her life, we win. And we're seeing that. Bras and panties both grew market share in the quarter and panties to a really impressive degree. And we're proud of that. And we see a long runway, and we're excited to keep that going.


Matthew Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Scott, maybe just as a follow-up. Relative to the benefit from lower promotional activity in the third quarter, I mean, to what extent did you embed opportunity in the fourth quarter? And maybe just what inning overall do you see this opportunity on the promotional front? Or is there a way to kind of bifurcate the margin to get to double digits relative to where we're at today? How much of this is promotional activity? How much of this is SG&A? Maybe just any way to break down that delta.


Scott Sekella
Chief Financial and Operating Officer

Yes. So tackling the Q4 piece first. There's less promotional benefit in our Q4 margins right now just because it's a heavier promotional quarter, as you know. But there is still a shift to more, I would say, regular price selling, which is a bit different than just a straight pullback in promo. So an example is really we're -- we just, this week, had our second collab on LoveShackFancy and PINK. And so that's going to be more regular price selling sort of mix than what we've had in the past.

And then as you think longer term, the promo piece, I think we're still in sort of the early middle innings, I would say, on the promotional pullback. It is going to be a multiyear journey. But the #1 lever as we think about margin expansion is just how we're going to leverage our solid operational foundation, and that's both on buying and occupancy and SG&A as we grow north of 1% to 2%. That flow through to the bottom line will far outweigh the promotional pullback over the next couple of years.

Our next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Group.


Dana Telsey
Telsey Advisory Group LLC

Congratulations on the nice progress. Two things. As you think about beauty, which I think you've always mentioned is the bigger market than intimates, how do you think about the beauty progress over the next year, what it could do on the top line and how it could impact margins? And then also the marketing being as effective as it is in attracting new customers, any framework of those customers' age, income levels? Anything that you're noticing and what you'd do differently next year at all to keep the active customer growth going? And then just lastly, Store of the Future. Thoughts on next year for Store of the Future. Any changes or enhancements that you want to make?


Hillary Super
CEO & Director

Thanks, Dana. I'll start out with the question around Beauty. So as you know, Beauty has been our stronger business for the last couple of years and has like a very impressive 2-year stack. We have just started really reinvesting in Beauty, reinvesting in the innovation pipeline, investing in talent and thinking about how can we really supercharge this business.

So as I think about 2026 and 2027, in 2026, there are a number of insights that we have that are known to us that we can go after, whether it's the fact that only 40% of our current customer base is shopping beauty, and there's a lot within our own internal file that can be claimed and converted and then continued customer acquisition and really integration of beauty within each brand to be an extension and more connected to each brand. And then PINK beauty, we've only just very much scratched the surface of.

So we think there's a lot of near-term known opportunities for optimization in Beauty. In 2027 and beyond, it's really about what's unknown today and the innovation pipeline and reaching into the future and bringing that to market to really excite and delight our customers. So short term, double down on what we know the opportunities are and optimize the business. Slightly longer term, it's really about reaching into the unknown and innovating.

Your second question is about marketing and new customers. Okay. So we're very excited about this, both in the new and reactivated. We are seeing an uptick in 18- to 24-year-olds, which is extremely exciting. We're seeing growth across all income cohorts with a slightly larger uptick in high-income customers, but growth across all of them. And I would say most importantly, they were coming into the brand based on product, brand and emotion and not on promotions.

They're coming into the stores, they're showing associates photographs and videos and saying they need this, they want this. And that's exactly the place that we want to be. And so as we continue to fine-tune our brand heat initiatives, as we continue to fine-tune our creative, we're really going hard at what is culturally inspiring in this moment and how do we engage with that new customer.


Scott Sekella
Chief Financial and Operating Officer

And then I'll tackle the Store of the Future. We're continuing to look at our Store of the Future concept and how do we optimize it with the Path to Potential strategy. So how do we better assort as we continue to supercharge bras, as we continue to drive PINK, particularly PINK apparel. But now with some of the learnings around PINK intimates that we had in the quarter, how do we better optimize and assort PINK in the stores and differentiate PINK in the stores.

So I think those are things we're taking away, these learnings, and applying them real time. And it will impact not only next year but, I would say, the next couple of years. And then I think the last opportunity we're looking at with Store of the Future is how do we drive that cross-shop with beauty even better. And so when we have a Very Sexy launch not only on the intimates side, how do we tie in Beauty with that sort of stuff? And so you won't see a wholesale change to Store of the Future, but you'll see these enhancements to help better drive our Path to Potential Strategy.

Our next question comes from Jungwon Kim with TD Cowen.


Jungwon Kim
TD Cowen, Research Division

Just curious on the apparel side, what's the mix now and where you see that trending over time. And also, I know you've been working on your lead time on the apparel side. What is the lead time now? And is there further opportunities to expedite that?


Hillary Super
CEO & Director

Sure. So when we first started talking about the PINK apparel opportunity, we had shared that, at one point, it was about 70-ish percent of the business and it had gone all the way down to mid-30s. It's now above 40% and climbing. We think ultimately it's somewhere in between 50% and 60% of the total PINK business. And we are extremely pleased. It was the leading category in the PINK business in Q3. We saw that, as Scott mentioned, much higher AUR, a lower discount rate. It was just a very solid business. So lots of optimism about that.

We also shared previously that we did the LoveShackFancy collaboration in 26 weeks. We continue to look for opportunities to shorten time lines and gain that agility. We have a wide range of ways to make chase into and make product and get to the market more quickly. And I think we have even further room that we can go. In some cases, we're doing things like making T-shirts in LA and get those very, very quickly. And we have core raw materials in all of our top iconic items. We can get into those quickly sub-26 weeks. And we continue to work on it.

So I would say we are early to mid-innings on our optimization of how we go to market in PINK apparel, and lots of opportunity to optimize that in the future.

Our next question comes from Marni Shapiro with The Retail Tracker.


Marni Shapiro
The Retail Tracker

Congratulations. The stores have had so much energy. It's been a pleasure to shop. So I'm so curious, I want to dig into Beauty a little bit, dovetailing on what everybody has said. I really liked your home launch in Victoria's Secret. And I'm curious, I guess, what you're thinking about in the future. Specifically candles are a big opportunity in general in the market. I thought it was really beautiful.

And then just also in PINK beauty, there -- with this brand coming back and the younger customer coming back in, the younger customer today is much more sophisticated than they were when PINK first launched. And there's a lot of good youth-facing brands that have come to market. So are you seeing a different kind of PINK beauty? And I would assume, like isn't there room for real PINK beauty business out there in light of the way the customer has changed?


Hillary Super
CEO & Director

Yes. The short answer is yes. We have recently just made some key hires in this area, a senior leader to oversee VS Beauty and merchandising and another senior leader to oversee PINK. They were at once a combined role. And as with everything, you focus on the bigger piece. So we see the opportunity. We're going to go after the opportunity. And I couldn't agree more that this is a much more sophisticated consumer than 20 years ago, and I think there is a significant prize ahead for that business. And what a fun job that is.

So I think we can't wait to roll our sleeves up and get into that. And then in home, we also think it's beautiful and are excited about it and we continue to believe it's an opportunity. In hindsight, I think we went very broad and very large for relatively unknown for us. So we've gotten very key learnings that are honing in on the best of the best and pushing that forward. And so we're going to continue to iterate on that category. And we feel good about it. We're proud of it.


Marni Shapiro
The Retail Tracker

And then can I just ask one quick follow-up on marketing? You've done a lot of collaborations, a lot of fun things this year. As we think about marketing as a percentage of sales into '26, are you guys going to plan it up? Or as sales increase, you're going to keep the percentage flat? Like what's just the thinking, I guess, behind where marketing spend should be?


Scott Sekella
Chief Financial and Operating Officer

Yes. I think you'll see the marketing tick up both in dollars and percent of sales. I don't know that it's going to be a massive jump, but we'll keep inching it up. And as we saw positive ROAS opportunities, we continue to invest in the quarter. So there are even real-time decisions we can make there. And our working media, as a percent of total, last year was closer to 70%. It's increasing more to 75% this year. And so even as the spend stays the same, we are shifting more spend into sort of consumer-facing areas.


Operator

Our last question will come from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo Securities.


Irwin Boruchow
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Scott, a couple of ones on the gross margin. I was hoping to ask. So just the way you're talking about ex the gift card breakage last year, the gross margin you're planning ex tariffs is up 200 basis points. Is that accurate ballpark?


Scott Sekella
Chief Financial and Operating Officer

Yes. That's a good description, yes.


Irwin Boruchow
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And that's a little bit lower than the ex tariff gross margin in 3Q because you're not planning as much as you are. So I guess that makes sense.

I guess the other -- the follow-up question I would have to that is, is this kind of run rate the way we should think about the first half assuming tariffs stay in place? And then obviously, your margin trajectory is now starting to move up. Does next year kind of act as a buffer year to that just because of the first couple of quarters of the year where you have to kind of like embed these tariff headwinds into the business? Just kind of curious like how much that throws you off your trajectory, like just said differently, like can you take margins up next year despite those pressures that you guys have in front of you?


Scott Sekella
Chief Financial and Operating Officer

Yes. And we're still working through our plan specifically for next year. But as you said, tariffs will be a headwind through the first half as they continue to come on. But the other thing we do have is our mitigation efforts will increase through next year because a big chunk of them really aren't taking hold here until Q4. So we'll be able to anniversary that, plus some of the select price increases we took in back half of this year will help offset in the first part of next year. So there will be some headwinds continued with tariffs, but the mitigation efforts will be ramping through the year as well. So that's how to think about it right now.
