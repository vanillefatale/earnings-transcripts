[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alex Zukin.

Aleksandr Zukin
Wolfe Research, LLC

Thanks for a really inspired and inspiring message. And congrats on a very strong end to the year. Maybe, Bill, first one for you. Just give us a flavor, a little bit of the tailwinds and headwinds that you're seeing, both in the demand environment from a budgetary perspective, and also kind of how you're thinking about the monetization of AI in the product set, particularly the consumption component to play out as we get through the year, you've already -- you clearly cleared the $500 million hurdle that you set for yourself well on your way to $1 billion. How should we think about that layering into the numbers? And then I've got a quick follow-up for Gina.

William McDermott
Chairman & CEO

Well, thank you very much, Alex, for your very nice remarks. And also given me a chance to explain how it's going out there in the marketplace. We have excellent hyperscalers in the marketplace. They're all great companies. We have exciting language models. We have good data lakes that are out there, too.

And we have, as you know, 6-plus decades of legacy systems that have really burdened these companies quite substantially but at the same time, they've customized them. They've invested heavily in them and they're not going to rip them out at least the ones that matter.

But what they are doing now is they are looking for platforms that really do matter and they are recognizing that MIT study that said basically 95% of those projects out there weren't delivering a positive ROI. They're recognizing clearly that you can have little pet projects that agentic AI is not just a revolution. It's the only way to survive. It's the only way to grow.

And so now they're looking for a platform that spans functions and goes across the business process frontier of their enterprise. As I've said repeatedly, it could be recruit to retire. It could be order to cash, procure to pay, designed to build. There are many of these processes but there's only one company that actually has a platform that's a cross-functional platform.

And so our cooperation with all of them has led many of our customers to simply say, we love it. We want to expand with you, which they're doing. But at the same time, they're looking to retire tools that don't matter. And they're looking to thoroughly examine functional platforms because if you could do cross-functional AI work to reinvent the process on the fly and it's autonomous, why do you want to get drug down by these little toys or large model -- large systems that perhaps have built up over the years with many different instances and people are swivel chairing between 33 apps a day.

So it's the radical simplification that comes with AI. And one thing I wanted to double down on is you can see our user count is growing. You can see it's growing in harmony with our revenue. And you can also see that our margins are growing. So we're really the winning hand for companies that want the consolidator, and they want a consolidator now. That's different than it was 6 years ago.

When I told you with the platform of platforms, and we work with everybody. We still do, but we have to respond to what the customer wants and they want cost out, they want autonomy in, and they want margin improved and growth, and we're giving it to them.

In terms of the buying cycle, what's so cool about this buying cycle is if you have an ROI and you're fast to value, which we are. We're the fastest one, you don't actually need a budget to get approval on your deal.

You just need an executive that wants to win, and the CEOs are investing heavily. Our pipelines have never been better. Let me be clear, never been better. And don't forget, we gave you those numbers without actually a full 40-day cycle in an approval of deals in public sector because of the government shutdown. So we've got a lot going on there, and we've got a lot on across industries and across all segments of the company.

And finally, security grew 100% year-over-year. So our customers are loving on the digital front door from Moveworks and we're loving having Moveworks, but they're really excited about Armis and Veza for all the reasons I stated in kind of the keynote here. So you should feel really good about ServiceNow. We didn't have to work hard to give you a great guide. It's there.

Gina Mastantuono
President & CFO

And then do you want to add?

Amit Zavery
President, Chief Product Officer & COO

Let me add things about the monetization of AI, Alex. So we already, of course, have been selling this hybrid pricing model, and we're already seeing a lot of customers now add assist packs. We shared in the earnings already that we had many customers with average deal size of $500,000 and some in multi 7-figure range. Renewing and adding more assist packs when they're running out of tokens. So that adoption and that consumption is starting to happen very, very fast, especially now that they're using a agentic use cases and workflows to run the business.

And once they start using one, they start using many more, and that's where the assist packs starting to come in. So the consumption part has been adding to our subscription revenue quickly as well.

William McDermott
Chairman & CEO

And the key to that building on what Amit said, which is so important. This is where cross-functional also comes in so heavily because these deals, in many cases, have 7 or more ServiceNow products built into them.

So we're not confined by we can make one buyer and the enterprise happy. We're actually making a team that reports to the CEO happy. So the strategic relevance is elevated considerably. And these assist we've been telling you that for a year. that the day was coming with a hockey stick with foam around the reload on those tokens, it's happening.

Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.

Sanjit Singh
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

This is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. Congrats on proving out the durability of growth of the business throughout the year. I wanted to follow up on some of the themes in Q3, particularly the federal business, can you maybe give us some color on how federal performed via your -- relative to your expectations?

I know we had a government shut down to deal with. There's some large deals in the pipeline. Just how that sort of shaped up in Q4 and what the prospects are looking like for the balance of the year in 2026 on the Fed side.

William McDermott
Chairman & CEO

Yes. What was really great about the Fed business is even with the shutdown and less days to do business, you have to comply with the procurement procedures. And as you know, 40 days is a minimum standard.

We were still able to get very, very nice deals. And our OneGOV offering has been really well received. So we're seeing a very big pipeline in public sector. What didn't happen in 2025 is only good news for 2026.

And we're also seeing that we have significant traction that's now developed in state and local. The public sector more broadly is growing not just U.S. Fed, which is great. but also state and local.

And I do want to mention we shouldn't forget the global government business because that was up 80% year-over-year. So the global government business is on fire across Europe, Middle East and obviously, Asia. So I feel really, really good that the brand is resonating and what we're doing in the U.S. is now translating beautifully to Rest of World. We're in great shape.

Your next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs.

Gabriela Borges
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

My question is for Gina, on the gross margin outlook. Tell us a little bit about how you think about the puts and takes to gross margin, particularly around some of the temporary headwinds you have before monetization on the consumption revenue part of the business, how much of the gross margin headwind from LLM cost, inference and API cost, how much of that is temporary versus structural?

Gina Mastantuono
President & CFO

Thanks, Gabriela, for the question. So listen, I'm really excited about the overall guide from a margin perspective. The fact that despite some headwinds in gross margins, we're able to increase operating margin guidance by 100 basis points and free cash flow by another 100 after increasing by 350 bps this year is pretty remarkable.

I'd say on the gross margin headwind, the bulk of it is actually our very strategic focus on moving more towards hyperscalers that have slightly lower gross margins at this stage of the game, given our capacity there with them than our internal.

Now those margins are margin business, you want me to take every single day, and we're offsetting any headwind down below the line with efficiencies. As we continue to scale up those hyperscaler deals, margins get even better.

And so you can count on ServiceNow to ensure that you will see not only best-in-class top line growth, up 20% plus but also continued margin accretion at the bottom line, both from an operating margin and free cash flow perspective.

Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies.

Samad Samana
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

The execution scale continues to be very impressive. So congrats on that. Bill, maybe a question for you. I appreciate you digging into the M&A given that it's been such a big focus, you made a point about there may not be more to expand the TAM, at least on the security side via M&A.

So should we take that as maybe we won't see Armis sized deals going forward? Or just maybe help us get some clarity on how we should think about M&A in 2026. And then Gina, if you could give us any details on Armis's financials? I know it hasn't closed yet, but it would be helpful just to think about how fast it's growing, size, scale, et cetera?

William McDermott
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thank you very much, Samad, for the question. First of all, I wanted to underscore what both Gina and I both said. We're an organic growth company. These were very select M&A moves for the talent, the technology and the moment to capture $125 billion market TAM.

And this is also where our customers wanted us to be. As I said, our security and operations portfolio right now is doubling year-over-year, and they wanted us to do more. I wanted to make it very clear to the investors. I hear you, and we did not and never have bought an asset, like many others have, and I know that's probably why it's on your mind, because we needed the revenue. What we needed is the innovation and the expanded growth opportunity of a great TAM and a customer base that's waiting for us.

So I want to knock that one out of the park based on our great 2025 results and our extraordinary guide. And as it relates to future M&A, we do not have a large-scale M&A on the road map. What happened, and I felt for you all, we had Moveworks. It took 9 months to close.

We no sooner closed Moveworks, which we love Moveworks. We love Bhavin and the founders of the company, and it's a great culture, great fit. We love them. Amit and I were no sooner celebrating in their campus with their spouses and everything, then we also closed on that and then had Armis and Veza come to you within like a few days.

So probably, it was a little bit what's going on over there at ServiceNow, and I noticed that we lost about $10 billion in market cap on that because of the worry. So now the worry is gone, you can give us back to market cap. And no, we're not going after anything large.

We now have them in the family, and we're going to grow them like we do everything else. And I would want to make one thing clear, and I'll give Amit a chance to do this is really important. We chose assets also that were heavily integrated with ServiceNow already. So this isn't one of those -- how is the integration going to go? It already went. So maybe Amit can give you a little color on that.

Amit Zavery
President, Chief Product Officer & COO

Thanks, Bill. So the way we've been doing -- clearly, we have this one platform philosophy, and we continue to invest that way. What Armis and Veza has been doing is we've been integrating those products using a technology called Universal Agenetic Network which is built on MCP and Workflow Data Fabric, making it easy for us to really have processes as well as a lot of the domain expertise, which come from Veza and Armis, make it integrated into a lot of the capabilities we provide in our one platform.

Over time, some of the capabilities which we have on one platform will be available through Armis and Veza, but they are right now completely integrated in a process-oriented way and allowing customers to get advantage of those integrations straight away.

Without having to wait, replatform, or do things which are not going to be more architecturally correct. So with architecturally, we've been very thoughtful about how we bring all these technologies while getting customer adoption quickly as well as value created for customers and this UAN is a really very modern way of integrating and providing technical superior way of integrating and bringing products together. So this will be very straightforward for our customers, and there's no real time loss when we bring all these capabilities into one platform mindset.

Gina Mastantuono
President & CFO

And then lastly, Samad, on your question on the impact. So we expect to close Armis at this point, second half, early second half of this year. And based on that timing and estimated revenue adjustments that always happen in acquisitions. We expect subscription revenue contribution to be about 1 point, so 100 basis points in '26. We expect potentially up to maybe 50 bps headwind to operating margin in '26 up to 50, so not that large.

And given our strong organic operating leverage, we expect to absorb any headwinds to that dilution in '27 and continue delivering operating margin expansion. And so we're very committed in our M&A strategy to continue to deliver expansion, both on the operating margin and free cash flow perspective. We'll obviously provide more details around all of that at Financial Analyst Day as we get closer to close. But again, not that big of an impact either on the top line or bottom line. It's really about the incredible capabilities and the addressable market that we're opening up for us to go after.

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Weed with AllianceBernstein.

Peter Weed
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

Congrats on a really strong finish to the year and guidance for the upcoming year. I think one of the exciting announcements that have been coming out are your partnerships with OpenAI and Anthropic, one obviously today and on a few days ago.

And I couldn't help but notice in reading those it looks like both of them are making some investments in helping with your customers and getting traction and scaling. Maybe you can share a little bit more about those partnerships. And obviously, now with multiple of them. There's also kind of the question of decisions for customers, like which one would you focus on? Like how do you think through which partner to pull and when? And how are the partners investing and kind of helping you get even more out of the customer opportunity and really driving the business faster?

Amit Zavery
President, Chief Product Officer & COO

Peter, thanks for the question. So as you know, we've been always working with many of the hyperscalers as well as the large language model providers. And we had open ecosystem as a mindset, with the large language providers like OpenAI, Anthropic as well as Google and Gemini, we allow customer choice, we have prompt engineer and make sure that those models work with our products and customers don't really have to worry about what the underneath the covers, what LLM we are using. They can choose if they want to and use any 1 which we provide out of the box. What we have done over time now is with each of these providers, there's some unique capabilities we think we can take to market.

So for example, OpenAI, what we're doing around voice AI and speech to speech real-time, multimodal as well as multilingual capabilities. So our CRM products can now have voice capabilities with OpenAI as a preferred model so that we can have a much more differentiated offering using what we know from domains perspective as well as contact and adding the OpenAI speech capabilities into our products.

Similarly, with Anthropic, they have a very good coding agent. A build agent, which is a white coding tool allows any customer to build any workflow on top of ServiceNow, and we use Claude as the underlying technology to generate some of the codes and then we provide the contact, the security, the governance, on top of that using build agent to run those workflows on top of ServiceNow as well.

So finding those unique use cases, which might be useful with one of these individual providers and they want to take those products to go to market with us. We, of course, collaborate with them and tell them about what's the issues with any model maybe, what kind of efficiencies we can get out of it, and how can we optimize it so our customers get value. but we still keep this idea of openness and availability of default choices for customers so they can choose anything they want to. And then we'll provide some unique use cases, which will be done with individual providers like OpenAI and Anthropic. Where they have interest to go jointly to market and build those unique solutions as well.

So customer guidance is pretty straightforward. They can choose any of the models, everything will work but there might be some of these individual use cases, we believe could really be turbocharged with some of these providers. And typically, in the infrastructure, the model providers are providing 5%, 10% of value and 90% of IP has been built by ServiceNow to really provide that context-driven enterprise use cases out of the box for our customers to get value instantly.

William McDermott
Chairman & CEO

And Peter, because your question is so strategic and so important. I'd just like to build on its excellent answer. We have to recognize the Harmony and the synchronicity between these models and ServiceNow. And the idea that these models are eating enterprise software may be true in some cases. But obviously, it's not true. In our case, they're actually leaning into us because of the innovation on our platform and the broad reach of our go-to-market global engine. So these are very enticing and interesting factors in their decision to team up with us.

But it also really does manifest itself, I think, is something that Dario said when he said, obviously, the co-founder of Anthropic, he said, a common error that enterprises make with AI is to treat it as a kind of bolt-on tool that you access now and then. But the way to get much better results is to make AI an integral part of how we get work done. And it has to be woven into the whole range of things workers do every day. That's where you actually start to see where these systems are adding value. And it's also why we're partnering with ServiceNow.

So it's kind of like where the decisions and the business takes place is in the workflow and the models need that to have the business impact and really to be resolute with the C-suite of these corporations.

So I think that it's really a match made in heaven. I think it's going to be a great tailwind for our growth, and I hope that we help them grow, too. So it's really a nice, nice thing. And I'm glad today we had a chance to clear it all up.

Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities..

Patrick Walravens
Citizens JMP Securities, LLC, Research Division

Great. And let me add my congratulations and my appreciation of the hitting the 3 bear cases upfront. So Bill, I was talking to a senior executive at a Fortune 500 company. And they really want to transform the enterprise using AI but there's some sort of specific concerns holding them back.

And I'm just -- they're 4 of them. I'm just going to rail them off really quick and I'm sure you have these kinds of conversations all the time with customers, and I just wonder how you address them.

Number 1 was, how do we monitor the agents in real time? Number 2 was, how do we have kill switches? Number 3 was, how do we have grading agents? And then number 4 was red teaming. So those are the kinds of things that come up all the time? Or was this unusual? And how do you address them?

Amit Zavery
President, Chief Product Officer & COO

No Pat. I'll address those. I mean I think -- no doubt every customer we speak to an enterprise are wondering how to adopt the AI, how to make it easy to manage and really have controls. And no doubt that questions come up every time in terms of what technology to use and do that very well. So the way we address it, the reason we launched AI Control Tower early last year and why it's getting so much traction is because we're addressing these things head on, right?

How do you manage and monitor agents real-time, not just our agents but third-party agents in one system it's really built on top of CMDB so we can now access all the kind of assets, be it hardware, software and AI agent assets in the same system and then we can really give you full-time real-time monitoring, observability as well as cost management, auditing, security in one place.

And that allows you to do kill switches, where you can now go and shut down any agent, which is going rogue, prevent any kind of nefarious activities as well as do red teaming and ensure you're making security as a prevalent and most important aspects of what you're doing before you go and deliver an AI agent.

And that really has opened up a lot of customers' ability to now adopt agentic use cases because before they were worried about losing control, security, governance and compliance now with AI Control Tower, we're able to give them that ability and remove that barrier out of the way. And that's where we saw this huge amount of new use cases emerge with customers and starting to adopt things around incident management, triaging and things like that, very quickly because we can give you that real-time visibility and full control.

So these are real questions and things we've been addressing and has really worked out and AI Control Tower has grown so fast for us because that takes on head-on as heterogenous product out there.

William McDermott
Chairman & CEO

And Patrick, one thing I would say as an example, I'll give you an example of a public sector entity. And the man himself who runs this particular entity has literally thousands and thousands of employees, nearly 100,000, and it's set up in 3 different divisions. What you're seeing a lot of now is they want to consolidate these divisions, they want to consolidate the action onto one platform because I keep going back to east to west, AI is a cross-functional sport.

There's only one CMDB in the world that behaves like ServiceNow's where they know where all the people are, all the places are, and all the things are on one platform and then you apply the AI in all of our know-how that Amit just outlined, and they're running quickly.

So he's got to make change fast. He doesn't have years. He has weeks and months, so we give them a business case to show them an incredible benefit on the ServiceNow Platform. And then they looked at what we did with Armis and Veza and they say, we're all in.

Please road map that into the thinking because I want to have one instance. I want to have one single view of my entire enterprise and I'm going with ServiceNow. In that conversation, we were basically consolidating them out of about 479 legacy tools. And that's what's happening out there because AI is changing the game, but this is the consolidator platform.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.

Matthew Hedberg
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Congrats from me as well, really strong results here. I guess for Bill or Amit, in an increasingly agentive world, it really does seem like Now Assist packs are resonating with customers and it's right to see the $600 million ACV number already. I guess when we're entering this period of hybrid pricing and paid seats are still growing strong, do you envision the time in the future when ServiceNow pivots completely away from seats to maybe consumption or some form of value-based pricing, for instance?

Amit Zavery
President, Chief Product Officer & COO

Matt, maybe I'll give you my perspective, and of course, Bill and Gina can add that. We keep on thinking about what's the best place to give customer value and show them what they can get out of the products, right? So we keep on getting input from them in terms of what kind of pricing and packaging works for them. typically, what we've seen, customers do want flexibility but they also want predictability.

So without having some kind of guardrails and understanding how much they're going to spend and what are they going to get out of it, going to complete 100% consumption may be too early in some of the cases. So I think that the hybrid model has seemed to be resonating with my customers. They know what the envelope they have, what they will be consuming beyond that, how much will it cost them?

And a lot of times, customers even have come back and say, You know what, I have been using a lot more than I'm entitled to. I will just renew or do an expansion on the thing with another higher subscription. So it might not be just consumption driven. So we just want to give that flexibility that some products we do, do consumption only already, by the way, right?

So we do things like storage or additional things you might want to use for capacity, we're doing that in some tokens around Workflow Data Fabric from an integration perspective. So wherever it makes sense, we will do that. As we go more and more AI native in terms of packaging, we want to continue still to make sure that we don't confuse our customers too much. and make it so difficult for them to predict what they're going to spend, that they can keep on staying on the sidelines. So we just want to manage that very well.

William McDermott
Chairman & CEO

And Matt, just building on Amit here for a second. Let me give you a real example. So Amit is 100% right that the customer wants predictability, which is why against some of the theories out there that would be would be seat compression which is why our active user base is growing 25%, okay?

It's because they want that predictability. The other thing they want is with the assist, when we sell a Pro Plus version of this platform, we have contemplated all the puts and takes on their business innovation and what the ROI is going to be to get the sale in the first place.

And so when they derive more value from the assist that they have that comes with the Pro Plus, they're happy to renew it. In fact, they're looking for more ways to use us. You never have a dissatisfied software customer when you've deployed the software and you have happy users, you have an eager customer that wants to expand. And that trend is really big in the AI world.

And finally, we're so flexible because what we do is where the rubber hits the road. We're delivering the ROI, and we know it. So I'll give you one example where we replaced the legacy CRM system. By the way, it's not the one I referenced in the script.

And the customer saved $682 million. And we would be very happy to take a percentage of that savings and give it to our great shareholders. But the customer will quickly pull back and say, no, no, I like the predictability of the seats. I'm good with that. I'm good with the assist, let's keep that going. And it's so strong in these business cases that we now have large FIs that are actually underwriting the savings on ServiceNow, underwriting it and guaranteeing it to the customer.

Just think about the swagger, we can walk into a C-level meeting with knowing that, sharing the logos and the examples. So no matter where the customer needs us to be, if they'd rather split the profits with us, we're open for business.

We have time for one more question and our final question comes from the line of Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer.

Brian Schwartz
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

I'm not sure if this is for Bill or Amit, it's on the topic of the Mega LLM provider partnerships. Bill, in your introductory comments, you're clearly making it clear. You viewed these Anthropics, OpenAI is more complementary to ServiceNow's product set than as competitors. I guess a question I wanted to ask you or Amit.

If we think about the percentage of AI inferencing and training workloads that are going to run on the platform in 2026, how do you think that mix would break out between those workloads running on ServiceNow's LLMs versus those third-party foundation models.

Amit Zavery
President, Chief Product Officer & COO

Yes. Brian, I think, as I said, we definitely want to make sure customers have choice, and they can use any of those foundational models as well as Now LLM. In many cases, we've seen customers may end up using frontier models because some of the use cases might make sense with the frontier models.

Inferencing as part of the overall workload is still very low as a percentage of cost or usage-wise, right? As they use tokens, we have a lot of other work we do on top of the inferencing part of it. which is really the whole context, data management, the integration, understanding the particular workflow required for use cases, they won't go and deliver on it.

So that's really where the most of power goes in, and I would say in the long term, I would see more of the frontier models as the inferencing models versus our Now LLM but their sovereign requirements, private data center requirements, things customers want to deploy in like on-prem not all these models don't work.

And that's where we would probably still continue using a lot of our third-party, our own Now LLM as well. So we just want to make sure we have choices and flexibility and let customers really choose it out. And from us, the cost perspective doesn't matter really.

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.
