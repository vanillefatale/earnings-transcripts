Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo.

Irwin Boruchow
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

A couple from me. I guess, Joe, could you just clarify Wrangler U.S. wholesale, it seems like it was probably up mid- to high single digits in the third quarter ex the shift. Can you confirm that? And then on the 4Q, can you kind of work with us on what's embedded in your -- in the Wrangler wholesale number there, both with the ship and then also organic? And I know you said POS flattened out in October, but then it sounds like it's accelerated the last couple of weeks. So kind of curious what's in the plan.

Joseph Alkire
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So on the timing shift, so the timing shift impacted Q3 revenue by about 2 points, with the primary impact being on the Wrangler brand. Excluding the shift, total revenue would have been above our prior outlook driven by Helly with Wrangler increasing at a mid-single-digit rate. So we had our largest September ever as a company. However, order flow, shipment flow was more back half weighted than what we anticipated in our prior outlook.

So the demand was solid. We just had a shift in shipment timing focused on a couple of the key accounts. We did see that pull through in October. I think I said in the prepared remarks; October was up 6% organically compared to the prior year. That's a little ahead of what we have contemplated in 4Q. In terms of growth, excluding the 53rd week.

So nothing we see from a demand standpoint. In fact, we've moved to the high end of the revenue range based on our year-to-date performance and our visibility into Q4 and Wrangler is probably the biggest part of that.

Irwin Boruchow
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. So no red flags on the consumer thus far in terms of what you're seeing.

Scott Baxter
President, CEO & Chair of the Board

And Ike, I would tell you, with our broad distribution and the campaigns that we're running right now with both of our denim brands right now that are out in the marketplace. In addition to the product and the design and just the demand, 14 consecutive quarters now. I mean you've seen that of market share gains with Wrangler, we've put ourselves in a really good position, really like where we sit now for the foreseeable future, and we'll continue to really work that through design great product, tell great stories, broad distribution. It's been a really nice formula of success for us going forward.

Irwin Boruchow
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. Moving to Helly. So up 11% pro forma growth. I think your first half, you were kind of trending more 1% to 2%, so a nice acceleration. What's driving the near-term inflection in Helly's brand revenue already? And then I guess based on the order book commentary, which is accelerating into next year, could we see Helly growth rates actually continue to accelerate over the next 12 months?

Scott Baxter
President, CEO & Chair of the Board

So I'll go ahead and start. What you're seeing is you're seeing a company that's thriving inside of another apparel company. They haven't had that ecosystem before relative to where they've sat the last decade or so, and now they're inside our ecosystem. We're thriving as far as partners working together. They're accelerating in all fronts, the European business, the China business, the U.S. business is really starting to take off. But obviously, we're feeding that.

So we're investing in that and we're seeing really good results. And I think the thing it starts with is they're really building great product. And I think they're having a lot of fun being part of our organization. I think the 2 companies are working really well together. And I think we see a bright future.

And I think one of the things that's been really important because we talked about it and it's important that we talk about it again, is we see a big opportunity in North America in addition to what we already have. And that is starting to come to fruition, just having the capability, having our resources in North America to lean on and then now going ahead and making it a priority because we have made that a priority, we're starting to see those results early. So we're really, really excited about what's happening there in the future. Joe, anything to add?

Joseph Alkire
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I'd say on the order book, I mean spring/summer '26, that order book for sport reflects an acceleration compared to fall/winter '25, fall/winter '25 accelerated versus spring/summer '25 and even fall/winter '24. So that business is performing really well. Workwear preorders have been strong, up at a low double-digit rate, and we just kicked off the fall/winter '26 selling season, and it's off to a really good start. The feedback from the marketplace has been really good.

We also will put more investment behind the business in '26, which should help further accelerate growth. So just a tremendous opportunity for the brand globally across both sport and work.

Scott Baxter
President, CEO & Chair of the Board

And I think one of the things that's really been beneficial is management and the team is intact from the acquisition.

So they were already a strong team, and we're only making it stronger by adding and helping, but we've got a good core team that we kept through the merger and the acquisition, and it's really played out really well for us.

Irwin Boruchow
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

That's great. And then just a quick one, lastly. On the inventory, Joe, can you help us get comfortable with that number? I think you said up 21% organic Q3, $645 million for the end of the year, which implies mid-teens organic. Just -- it doesn't sound like there's any issues at all but can you kind of hold our hand a little bit because it is a decent growth rate above where the core growth rate is for the business. So any more color there would be helpful.

Joseph Alkire
Executive VP & CFO

Sure, Ike. So we ended the quarter, excluding Helly Hansen, up about 21%, about $98 million versus the prior year. So roughly $25 million of that increase related to inventory investments we made to support our supply chain transformation. So we closed our Torreón manufacturing facility in Mexico during the third quarter as part of Project Jeanius, and we carried excess inventory to support the operational transition.

So that excess inventory will wind down over the course of the fourth quarter and into the first quarter, and that transition has gone really, really well. About $25 million of the increase relates to higher tariffs. So the cost of that is now embedded in our inventory and about $20 million related to earlier-than-expected receipts of sourced product as a result of lead times improving.

So the remaining increase is really in support of the growth plans that we have for the business. We said in our prepared remarks, we expect about $120 million reduction in Q4, and we remain pleased with the overall quality and composition of our inventory.

Our next question is coming from Bob Drbul from BTIG.

Robert Drbul
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Just a question on pricing. When you look at your business and you look at sort of the plans into next year, what's happening with pricing with your own product? And I guess, I'd be curious to just see what you're seeing competitively on pricing as well.

Joseph Alkire
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Bob, I would say for us, pricing has been part of a holistic strategy to combat the impact of the tariffs, right? Pricing for us went into effect mid-June in our own DTC and in July at Wholesale. So something we're watching very closely with our retail partners and look, these plans were put together in collaboration with them and all of the elasticity assumptions are reflected in the outlook.

We were very surgical, as you would expect, in terms of where we took price just as we have been in the past. And these price increases were not just a U.S.-focused effort. I think that's part of the power of a global multi-brand portfolio.

So overall, the price elasticity equation has been largely consistent with our expectation. It varies a bit by brand and category and channel, certainly, certain parts of the market are more sensitive, other more premium areas less so. But overall, the pricing elasticity equation has been in line with what we expected.

Scott Baxter
President, CEO & Chair of the Board

And Bob, one of the things that we pay particular attention to as an organization is that if you look at all of our brands globally and in the marketplaces where each operates, we really like from a hierarchy standpoint, where we sit. So we're really comfortable with where our brands are positioned and how they're priced than compared to our competitors within those marketplaces.

So we've been very thoughtful for a long time about how we price in the product that we have. So I'm comfortable with where we sit right now.

Robert Drbul
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And just 2 questions on Helly, if I could. I guess the first one, Scott, I think you mentioned you're seeing new opportunities. Just wondering if you could elaborate on that. And within the U.S. business, growing it from the $150 million level, is it like new distribution targets? I just -- if you could expand a bit on the plan in the U.S., that would be helpful.

Scott Baxter
President, CEO & Chair of the Board

Absolutely, Bob. Actually, it's everywhere and everything. So it's ski shops, it's independents. It's definitely U.S. wholesale. It's across the board. It's digital, it's owned and operated retail. So we've got multiple plans that come into different stages.

As you can imagine, we've thought it out from a capital standpoint on how we're going to embrace each one. And it's really interesting, Bob, we sat back, and we said to ourselves, it's even better than we thought at acquisition time. We think there's more than we thought about. It's more robust than we thought. And people are really reacting and responding very positively to our brand because they've seen it around the world before and they just haven't seen it enough here in the United States and its new and it's fresh and it's creating some excitement, but they haven't had the distribution to go ahead and purchase it for themselves.

But now we're going to give them that, and that is starting. And then just so you know, because we'll talk about this in the future, we are adding some really key personnel here over the next 12 to 18 months in some significant leadership positions to help support that going forward. So like we said before, it was a big opportunity, one of the strategic reasons we bought it. But as we sat back and now [indiscernible] gotten ourselves involved in this business; we think the opportunity is even bigger than we thought across the board.

Next question is coming from Jonathan Komp from Baird.

Jonathan Komp
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I want to follow up and ask the raise to the high end of the organic revenue growth to 2% for the year. Can you just maybe talk a little bit more directly what's driving that confidence? And then Joe, it sounds like from your inventory buildup, you may be planning healthy organic growth into 2026. Just any color there would be helpful.

Scott Baxter
President, CEO & Chair of the Board

Yes, Jon, it's Scott. I'll go ahead and start. Really, Jon, we're looking at our business and we're just seeing real strength across the board. Let me start with Helly. I mean we've talked about the fact that Helly is really coming online very quickly, faster than we thought. The companies are working really well together, and we're seeing opportunity across the board.

And more importantly than anything we're seeing our consumer want to take out our business. So our POS is strong. We watch really closely our digital business because it's an opportunity for our consumer to purchase immediately, and it's been very strong across our brands and strong with Lee too, which gives us confidence in our turnaround because it's the first opportunity that people can interact with us after we put our turnaround in play.

But across the board, really strong from a digital standpoint. So that gave us confidence. The strength of our business here in the third quarter as we reached towards the end of the third quarter and saw this really strong uptick in POS gave us a lot of confidence. And then I would tell you that October gave us a lot of confidence. October came in on plan, no issue at all.

So really feeling good about that as we come through the first month of the fourth quarter, feel confident there. And then more than anything, our team is designing really good product and we're telling. We've got 2, right now, 2 national campaigns going on with Wrangler and Lee, which has got us in the marketplace in a fairly significant way, which is really important. And weather is really cooperating.

I'll give you a great example. Helly is a rainwear and outdoor and ski and active and pro-business. And we've had more rain across this world, Europe, Asia and the United States. And now we've got early snow across Europe and also here, which we didn't have last year at this stage. So that gives us a really, really good push forward as we enter into that really critical period. So lots to be thankful for right now, but mostly for our great folks here that have got their heads down and working hard. Joe?

Joseph Alkire
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Jon. And on inventory, I know it's a little noisy here with the addition of Helly and some of the transitory impacts that I highlighted. But we're comfortable with the composition of the inventory, the sequential progression we have planned, how that's positioned in support of the growth plans and Helly as well. We've talked on prior calls about the net working capital opportunity.

At Helly, you'll begin to see the impact of that starting in the fourth quarter and into the first half of next year, which will help contribute to some strong cash generation as we move into next year.

Jonathan Komp
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Great. That's helpful. And maybe as a follow-up, as we look to 2026, could you help to frame up as we think about the contribution from Jeanius where you stand and the incremental benefit that you may achieve? And then also the Helly Hansen operating contribution, I think you reiterated $0.20 for this year. But what are some of the factors that might impact how that can grow into next year?

Joseph Alkire
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I'll take that, Jon. So on '26, certainly not giving an outlook today, but I'll give you a high-level framework just given all of the moving parts. So we expect the organic business to continue to grow. We are performing well. That's going to be mainly driven by the Wrangler brand. '26 will be a transition year for Lee. The Helly business is performing really well. As you've seen, we will delever quickly, which will create an earnings tailwind as well as additional capital allocation optionality as we consolidate and grow that cash flow and that earnings stream, you'll have synergies that will scale more meaningfully across 2026, and you've got Project Jeanius savings that will be maturing to more of a full run rate.

We will have a bigger impact of tariffs next year. For 2026, the full year unmitigated impact is about $135 million, which we're clearly working to mitigate a significant portion of that. But those are the biggest factors influencing '26. We like where we are. We like our model, and we've got a lot of optionality to continue to drive the growth and returns that we expect.

Next question is coming from Mauricio Serna from UBS.

Mauricio Serna Vega
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

First, maybe could you tell us or confirm like what's kind of like the Q4 organic revenue growth that you're expecting in your guide? I mean, you talked about October being 6%. I just wanted to get a sense of what's the expectation for the fourth quarter.

And then on Helly Hansen, you raised revenue contribution a little bit for the year, but there was no really change in the EPS revision of $0.20. So just wondering what were the puts and takes on that.

Joseph Alkire
Executive VP & CFO

Mauricio, I'll take those. So for the full year outlook, we raised the outlook, right? Part of that was the Q3 outperformance that we had. Part of that is the increased visibility into the fourth quarter. So we now expect to be at the high end of the prior outlook range on revenue organically. We've got a stronger contribution from Helly Hansen, and we increased our gross margin, earnings and cash flow.

For the fourth quarter, our outlook implies about 6% growth on an organic basis. That includes the 53rd week, which is contributing about 4 points to the growth. You also have the benefit of the timing shift that impacted us in the third quarter.

So when you put all that together, we have modest growth contemplated for the business in the fourth quarter. Helly Hansen is expected to contribute close to $240 million of revenue as well in the fourth quarter, growing nicely compared to the prior year. So the assumptions underlying the organic revenue, we've assumed POS trends that are modestly positive, which is what we've seen for the majority of the year.

Things have been a little stronger over the last couple of weeks as weather has been more cooperative. And then inventory levels at retail, we really haven't assumed any meaningful change. Our retail partners remain in a fairly conservative posture as they have all year, and we don't expect that to change.

Mauricio Serna Vega
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Got it. Very helpful. And then maybe just very quickly on Lee, you sound very positive about the feedback that you're getting from the equity campaign. Maybe could you talk a little bit more about more green shoots on the brand? And you've mentioned like sequential improvement for fourth quarter. Is that sequential improvement versus the 9% decline or versus like the 4%, excluding the China proactive actions?

Joseph Alkire
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Mauricio, I'll take the latter part, and then Scott can take the first part. So the sequential improvement that we referenced is excluding the impact of the China actions in the third quarter. So I would think about sequential improvement relative to the 4% decline that we saw in the third quarter.

Scott Baxter
President, CEO & Chair of the Board

So Mauricio, I would tell you, similar to some of the comments that I've already made, we're seeing that our investment is paying off. And what I mean by that is we've invested dramatically in both our product engine and also our advertising and marketing. And so creating the right product for the marketplace, specifically in the channels that we sell the product in at the right price, as I mentioned earlier, and then telling a really great story behind that takes a little bit of time because, as you know, this business, you order out over a period of time. So to see your results, it takes 6, 9 months, sometimes a year, except for in the digital component. And what we've seen here early on is a very strong response in the digital component from both male and female, which is really important to us. Our female business is doing exceptionally well.

So our conversations with our wholesale partners across the globe and also our own retail stores across the globe have been very positive. I've been pleased. We've been at this, as you know, for about 18 months now and still have a little ways to go. We're never going to be satisfied obviously, going forward. But those are some of the key components as to how we look at the business and how we measure and monitor how it's doing.

And the sequential improvement has been really important because it's also a shot from a morale standpoint to the team, too, as you can imagine, when they're making product that's really working and the marketplace is talking about it, they feel really good about it. So we've got that type of momentum, too. So more to come over time because I think we've been very transparent in sharing the story as we've gone along, and we'll continue to do that. But right now, the way I would describe it is that everything is on track to how we planned it from the very beginning.

Next question is coming from Paul Kearney from Barclays.

Paul Kearney
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

My first is clarifying on the October organic growth of 6%. Is that including the shift of timing from Q3 into Q4? And then on the Q4 guidance, I'm just curious on -- is it assumed in the Q4 guidance a continuation of the POS at mid-single digit that you saw in the last 2 weeks? And then a follow-up.

Joseph Alkire
Executive VP & CFO

Paul, it's Joe. On October, yes, it does include the impact of the timing shift that we talked about. And for POS, the POS assumptions for Q4 does not assume that the mid-single-digit increases that we've seen over the past several weeks continue for the balance of the quarter. Our POS assumptions for Q4 are modestly positive.

Paul Kearney
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And then my next is on -- I think you pointed to $25 million of run rate synergies for Helly Hansen for 2026. I guess, can you speak to any clarity on timing on achieving some of those synergies? How should we think about flowing those through in our model versus reinvestment? And just when should we expect to achieve those and which ones.

Scott Baxter
President, CEO & Chair of the Board

Yes, I'll take that, Paul. So we do have direct line of sight to pretty significant synergies across the business. That list of synergies is growing. The deeper we get into the business, as you can imagine. Part of that is just -- we are a more synergistic owner as a global brand operator and a lot of the pain points for the Helly business are -- there are strengths. So they'll benefit greatly.

Helly will benefit greatly from being part of our platform as we more fully integrate the business. The $25 million that we talked about, we're starting to see it now. It's smaller for 2025. We're starting to see some of those benefits now. Those will scale more meaningfully across the course of '26, and we'll lay that out in the full context of our '26 outlook in February.

Operator

Next question today is coming from Brooke Roach from Goldman Sachs.

Brooke Roach
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Scott, Joe, I'm hoping you could provide an update on where you stand on Project Jeanius savings realization. What proportion of the greater than $100 million savings have been realized to date? What's still on the horizon into 4Q and to 2026 as you mature into those savings? And how should we be thinking about the opportunity for flow-through to the bottom line as you contemplate continued investments into each of your core brands, including demand creation?

Joseph Alkire
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Brooke, so for 2025, we've got about $50 million of gross savings embedded in the outlook. That's above our previous expectations. So those savings compared to our initial outlook have allowed us to reinvest back into the business at a level beyond what we previously anticipated, and those investments are certainly part of the fuel for the growth and the momentum that we're seeing.

The benefits of Jeanius and the investments we've made, like I said, they're fully reflected in the outlook. We do expect those benefits to scale materially in 2026 and reach the $100 million of annual savings run rate. We will reinvest a portion of those savings. But as we've said from the very beginning, a portion of these savings will be reinvested back into the business and a portion of these savings will drop to the bottom line and drive profitability and returns improvement.

Brooke Roach
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Great. And just a follow-up. I was hoping we could double-click on the Lee China business. Are you fully reset in that business today? And do you expect that business to begin to return to growth as we turn the corner into 2026? Where are we in the transition?

Joseph Alkire
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I'll start, Brooke. So there's no change to the significant opportunity we see in China longer term. We're more confident in our approach going forward than we've been over the past couple of years, we've got a strong team on the ground there. For the past 18 months or so, we've been working to reestablish our foundation in China for Lee as part of the brand's global approach to the turnaround. Our results have improved over the past year, but there's still more work to be done, and this market remains very dynamic, as you know.

The actions we discussed in our prepared remarks reflect the next set of initiatives to really strengthen our presence in the market and build a stronger foundation going forward. So more specifically, we've been consolidating distribution partners. We've been partnering with larger, more sophisticated partners in the market that can invest with us to build and drive the brand going forward.

We've taken actions to address inventory challenges in the market. We've elevated our own DTC presence. So there's a number of things that we've been working on behind the scenes. But I'd say the majority of the heavy lifting is behind us from here.

Scott Baxter
President, CEO & Chair of the Board

And I would just add, if you step back a little bit, Brooke, some of the things that came out of COVID and what the world went through, there were some things that happened and some bad practices and what have you. And we've got ourselves now at a point where we've got a really impressive leadership team and a great leader over there.

But in addition to that, probably the most important thing is we really have a real strategy there now that makes a lot of sense for what this marketplace is going to look like going forward. So over the last 9 to 12 months, I've become much, much more happy with kind of how we're thinking about it and kind of really like the thought process and the strategy that's gone into it. So we felt -- and this is the point, we felt really confident to make this investment, and that's what drove that. We like the strategy. We like where it's heading.

We're happy to make an investment to put them in really good footing and then we move forward from there. So I think that from the standpoint of what's happened here in the last 5 or 6 years with the whole world that we're in a better place than we've been in China in a long time. And I think the future looks bright.

Brooke Roach
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Best of luck going forward.

Next question is coming from Laurent Vasilescu from BNP Paribas.

Laurent Vasilescu
BNP Paribas, Research Division

Joe, I was hoping to get a little bit more color again around FY '26. I remember last year on the third quarter call, you provided preliminary thoughts, particularly on the top line. I think you mentioned 1H '25 should grow 4%. Just curious to know, is there any rationale why we're not getting any preliminary thoughts for 1H '26 top line on an organic basis? And then I think, Scott, you mentioned Lee is not going to be linear, but how do we think about when should Lee actually return to growth in all markets?

Joseph Alkire
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Laurent, I'll start. Yes, I'd say on '26, I gave the framework, if you will. I'd say, this year versus last year, there are a few more moving pieces, as you know, and we're right in the middle of our planning process now. So we'll be back in February and give the detailed outlook as we normally do.

Scott Baxter
President, CEO & Chair of the Board

Laurent, as product flows and how we create and make product and go to market, I think our confidence is really building that late '26, fall/winter '26, you're going to see us even out and then start our growth algorithm right after that.

So feeling really good entering this year, feeling really good about how the product is going to flow in and feeling really good about the product itself that will go ahead and resonate with some stabilization by the end of the year and then growth by the end of the year, beginning of the next year.

Laurent Vasilescu
BNP Paribas, Research Division

Okay. Great, helpful. And then, Joe, just one sticking point here. There's $0.78 of adjustments is actually larger than the actual GAAP EPS number. Curious to know what the adjustments we should contemplate so we can actually have our models buttoned up for 4Q. What kind of adjustment should we have for 4Q? And when longer term, I think you mentioned to Brooke, there's $50 million of gross savings from Project Jeanius, but when should we see the adjusted and GAAP EPS converge? And of the $100 million, how much of it actually flows through to the bottom line?

Joseph Alkire
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I'll take that, Laurent. So as we've discussed on prior calls, we will have onetime adjustments as we move through Project Jeanius as we move through the acquisition of Helly Hansen. I think those are pretty difficult given the transformational nature of those projects. I would say the cost to date have been in line with our expectations.

The onetime adjustments that we saw in the third quarter, primarily related to the closure of our Torreón manufacturing facility as well as the integration of Helly Hansen on the SG&A side. But look, we don't pay our bills with adjusted earnings. We don't pay our shareholders with adjusted cash. So we're measuring the cash returns of Jeanius and the returns on Helly and our cash generation remains robust. We raised the cash flow outlook for '25, and we expect another year of strong cash generation in '26, and that includes the impact of the onetime adjustments.

Operator

Next question is coming from Peter McGoldrick from Stifel.

Peter McGoldrick
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I am interested on the cash flow guidance following up on Laurent's question. The -- so the step-up is significantly higher than the adjusted earnings increase in the outlook. So I'm curious if you can bridge the gap on working capital adjustments or any other items influencing the outlook to $400 million operating cash flow.

Joseph Alkire
Executive VP & CFO

It's really the working capital, Peter. It's the sequential reduction in the inventory in addition to the earnings growth for both the organic business as well as Helly.

Peter McGoldrick
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And then on the increased gross margin guidance for the year, can you work through the puts and takes here, whether it be by brand, Helly Hansen versus the denim brands, any fundamental drivers or if there's any influence from the tariff assumption and inventory timing flow-through?

Joseph Alkire
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I'll take that, Peter. So on Q3, we were up 80 basis points overall, 140 basis points, excluding Helly Hansen. For the organic piece, mix was about 170 basis point benefit, that's channel mix, product mix, business mix. Our Project Jeanius benefited gross margin by about 90 basis points. And then tariffs net of our mitigating actions as well as higher product costs hurt us by about 120 basis points.

For the fourth quarter, we've got 110 basis points contemplated. The organic business will be up modestly with Jeanius, and mix being offset by tariffs, net of the mitigating actions as well as higher product costs. So the year-over-year increase in Q4 gross margin is primarily Helly related, which will be nicely accretive for us in the fourth quarter.

Operator

We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Scott for any further closing comments.

Scott Baxter
President, CEO & Chair of the Board

Thank you. I just wanted to say a big thanks for spending time with us today and all your thoughtful questions and -- as you can see, we're working really hard here and our consumers are trusting us because they're choosing us going forward, which is really important, and we certainly appreciate that.

We've got a much broader story to tell as Helly Hansen unfolds, but I just wanted to mention that we couldn't be more pleased with our acquisition and how it's going and really enjoy working with the team there, a really good team, and it's been a really thoughtful merger of our 2 companies and just going really well, which we'll spend some more time talking about going forward. And because we won't spend any time together before the end of the year, I want to wish everybody a happy holiday season, and we'll look forward to seeing you after the first of the year. But again, thanks for your interest in our company. We really appreciate it.
