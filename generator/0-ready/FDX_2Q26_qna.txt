[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.

Brandon Oglenski
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

John, you just covered a lot in guidance there, and I'm sure will get plenty of questions on it. But I guess, longer term, it looks like you guys are definitely capturing incremental volume share in your domestic U.S. business, the package business that is and seeing quite a bit of pricing upside too. So I wondered if you can talk to some of the dynamics there on both B2C and B2B and maybe if there's more to come on yield gains.

Brie Carere
Executive VP & Chief Customer Officer

Brandon, it's Brie. I'm happy to answer the question. So from a volume and a market share perspective, yes, are very pleased with the profitable market share. And again, from an FEC perspective, we were really pleased with the flow-through in the quarter. The incremental margin expansion of 100 basis points at FEC is something we're really proud of. And that was driven by a couple of things: one, continued focus on B2B. We've been building this strategy for over a year. We've been very focused on our KPIs and our metrics within the sales organization. We made a pivot to our sales compensation model as well to make sure that, that is balanced from a B2B and a B2C perspective.

And then also, as you heard, we're really pleased with our overall rate discipline and the capture on surcharges. So our goal is to continue to push on this, continue to acquire new B2B market share, and we're really pleased with the underlying momentum.

The next question is from Jonathan Chappell with Evercore ISI.

Jonathan Chappell
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Brie, I want to stick with that topic. The B2B over half the revenue growth in 2Q. Just wondering if there's any way to break down how much of that is completely new volume business? How much of that is related to kind of yield and some of the surcharges initiatives you're putting in? And should we think about that as being kind of a similar magnitude of overall growth as you think about the guide for the back half of the year?

Brie Carere
Executive VP & Chief Customer Officer

Jonathan, great question. So overall from a trend perspective and I just want to be clear, it was nearly half, it wasn't over half. Still very pleased with that metric. Let me be clear about that as well. But we expect that to be pretty consistent throughout the year from Q1 through Q4. To your question on acquisition, I will really say that the quarter had multiple things going. From a B2B perspective, yes, we did acquire new B2B. We also did a great job from a share of wallet, and I should not understate that also it was the strongest quarter that we had seen from a small business B2B perspective. So it really was the combination of all 3 combined with our revenue quality strategy. I don't think it was any one of those things.

The next question is from Richa Harnain with Deutsche Bank.

Richa Talwar
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

So I wanted to ask about service, more specifically the cost of service. Recently, you shared plans regarding management's annual cash incentive and you added a service component to that, which speaks to the significance you place on service as you work through your Network 2.0 transformation. We would think that comes with additional costs. So how much do you estimate you're carrying today in terms of those additional costs? And what's worked into the outlook? And how should we think about those costs trickling off? I'm sure, for instance, Canada is being run much more efficiently now than when you started your integration efforts. So how long did it take for that to become fully efficient?

Rajesh Subramaniam
President, CEO & Director

Okay, Richa, let me answer that question. In fact, let me answer 2 components of it. One, you started to talk about the annual incentive compensation and to add to the points that was made earlier in our prepared remarks, as last year, our AIC payouts were well below target. This year, we have included the service component. And we anticipated several headwinds. And despite that, the team is doing an absolutely incredible job of performing in this quarter. So while that's a financial headwind for the year, it's absolutely the right thing to do as our team is going above and beyond the call of duty on delivering on that Purple Promise. So that's in the AIC.

Your question was really around the Network 2.0 and the cost. Listen, first of all, we are not going to compromise on our service. Good service is good quality, good quality is actually less waste. And we're very pleased with the progress that we are making there. And obviously, we have made very good progress in Canada as well. You can typically expect in the market roughly 3 to 6 months where we get the efficiency back. And that's all dialed in into our forecast, both for the short and long-term Network 2.0. Thank you again for the question, Richa.

The next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo.

Christian Wetherbee
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to ask a little bit about the LTL business, the freight business. As you think about some of the -- I guess maybe we're curious about potential duplicative costs as you guys get prepared for the spin. Is there a sense of how much or maybe the increment on the further decline from $100 million to $300 million on the EBIT decline comes from that? I guess just trying to get a sense if there are some temporary costs associated with the spin, that stuff come out? Or is it really more of a function of what's happening in the broader market? Obviously, shipments are a little bit weaker, yields a little bit under pressure, too.

John Dietrich
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Chris. I'll take that. As I mentioned in my remarks, we had $25 million in this quarter. We are anticipating of the $300 million, $100 million of that is the result of the separation costs. That is a combination of the acceleration of the sales force hiring, which Brie mentioned is going extremely well as well as IT and other costs, all in the spirit of accelerating, which we're seeing some of the results and the improved performance. So thank you.

Operator

The next question is from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan.

Brian Ossenbeck
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Maybe first, John, just to clarify, the costs you're talking about, are those separate from the spin-off costs, which are included -- excluded rather from the EPS guide? And then just wanted to hear a little bit more about MD-11 process, getting them back up to speed, it seems like it will take a little while, but it also seems like there's an incremental step-up in terms of headwind into the third fiscal quarter. Is that more or less because of the peak season? And I think we're expecting that to tail off a little bit, but it seems like it's actually increasing. So additional thoughts around that would be helpful.

John Dietrich
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Brian. I'll cover the first part. Those are separate costs that I identified in the $600 million. These were included in our reportable earnings. So with regard to the MD-11, yes, our current outlook reflects that those aircraft will return to service in the fourth quarter. We do have some incremental costs in the third quarter, particularly in December. As I noted, $25 million was in November. But in December, we'll have significantly higher costs incurred on the MD-11, that's peak season. And it's an expensive time of year to be getting outsourced lift to begin with, let alone when you have fleet grounded. So I would say of the remaining $150 million substantial part of that $175 million will be in the third quarter.

Rajesh Subramaniam
President, CEO & Director

Let me just add one more point on this thing, Brian. Our first priority and will always be safety above all. And that's the principle which we have built. We are working hand in hand with the authorities on the protocol to get these aircraft back in flight. I was there with the MD-11 hangar just on Tuesday night. We have a phenomenal set of aircraft technicians who are working on it. And we're waiting for the right protocol to get it released in the timing that John talked about.

The next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.

Scott Group
Wolfe Research, LLC

John, I just want to follow up on that $600 million headwind you talked about in the back half of the year. I think you gave -- there's 3 pieces to it. Any way you can sort of break down that $600 million into the 3 buckets you laid out and maybe how much of that is in Q3? And then maybe just along with that, like, I know you said earnings would be lower in Q3, but any sort of magnitude, I don't know, maybe the way to think about it, do you think earnings are flat, higher, lower year-over-year? Maybe that will be helpful if you could give a little bit more color.

John Dietrich
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Scott. So of the $900 million, we incurred $300 million of that in the first half of the year. To your question for the second half of the year, we've embedded the remaining $600 million in our outlook with about $160 million of that due to expected continued softness in the LTL business. up to a total of about $175 million for the MD-11 grounding and for the majority of which we expect in Q3 and the remainder, about $265 million for increased variable compensation. So with regard to your question on Q3, I'm not going to give Q3 guidance. But what I can tell you is that the Q3 adjusted EPS will be sequentially lower than Q2. We expect revenue sequentially to be essentially in line with Q2. Slight increases as well in operating expense on a sequential basis due to the increased peak demand, some of the increased volumes we're talking about and higher costs due to the MD-11 grounding.

I think an important reminder, too, is we'll be lapping a third quarter that was unusually strong seasonally. We had a lot of drive benefits in the third quarter of last year. We also expect Q4 to be our strongest adjusted EPS quarter for the fiscal year. And directionally, that's consistent with the patterns that we've typically experienced.

The next question is from Tom Wadewitz with UBS.

Thomas Wadewitz
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Yes. So I wanted to get your sense of -- I think what we've seen in the past over time is that FedEx can -- as they're developing momentum a couple of quarters into margin improvement, you do tend to run into this refilling of the incentive comp bucket, and that tends to be a headwind for a period of time. It seems like sometimes that can be like you go a couple of hundred million one year and then there's more to go to next year. So I guess I'm just wondering about do you think this is kind of like you get -- you take the hit over a couple of quarters now and then you're kind of ready to go for fiscal '27 where you see more of the Network 2.0 savings come in? Or I guess, just how do we kind of think about that?

And then relative to just the progress on your FEC margin, which has been good for -- I think you said 5 quarters in a row and it seems like you're maybe pausing admittedly for a couple of reasons. But just kind of how do we think about broader FEC margin improvement? And is this kind of a couple of quarter headwind on refilling the incentive comp? Or is this something that might carry into kind of next year as well?

Rajesh Subramaniam
President, CEO & Director

Well, thank you, Tom, for the question. Let me lead off and if John wants to add to it, he can. As we are looking at FY '26, we are basically catching back up where we should have -- we're comparing it to last year. I think that is not a headwind that we'll have going forward into fiscal '27. So that hopefully answers that question. The second part of it is, we are very, very pleased with the underlying momentum that we have in our business. This is now working the transformation that we have on our network transformation, our organizational transformation, our digital transformation, all are working. Our commercial teams are executing at a high level as you can see the results. So we are pleased with the underlying momentum and the flow through. There are certain things that are happening peculiarly. There are incremental headwinds for this next 3 to 6 months. But on an ongoing basis, we are very pleased with the ongoing momentum here.

The next question is from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.

Jordan Alliger
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Just a question. The bridge to the midpoint is very helpful. I'm just sort of curious, though, the $19 are at the high end, is there a way you could frame up what would push it? Is that mostly tied to volumes looking better, the LTL environment looking better, more acceleration in B2B? Like how do we think about framing to the north of the midpoint?

John Dietrich
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Jordan, I guess my quick response is all of the above. We're not going to really speculate as to all the factors that could go into it. Obviously, if revenue is stronger, and our cost environment is better than we're anticipating, you're going to find yourself in the upward end of the range. So there are so many variables in place. And we feel comfortable with the assumptions we've laid out that we're going to be within the range and focused on being as far into the range as we possibly can.

The next question is from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.

Bascome Majors
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

The domestic parcel growth rates have been really solid for several quarters in a row now. And as we get -- the indication from the guidance is that you expect that to continue. As we get further in the next year and UPS potentially gets some competitive advantages back with relationship with the Postal Service and potentially maybe some contractual competition 3 years past the new Teamsters deal and some of the share shift that happened there. Do you think that growth is something that we can maintain at a high level into fiscal '27? Or could those potentially be headwinds that we should consider tapering the rate?

Brie Carere
Executive VP & Chief Customer Officer

Thanks for the question, Bascome. I do not believe that a relationship between our 2 competitors is a competitive threat. As we've talked about, our focus right now is high value segments, B2B, home delivery, ground commercial, these are not services that could be serviced by the Post Office. And so if that does materialize, I do not see it as a threat to our primary growth strategy. We have the stronger value proposition, and we're very focused on continuing to take profitable market share.

Operator

The next question is from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.

Ken Hoexter
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just on the -- simplify that freight, John, I guess you've mentioned it a few times, but the $300 million impact, if you pull out the $100 million in ongoing costs, is that -- the leftover, $200 million, is that due to weakening demand? And I'm wondering what your view is of the competitive environment there. And then the $152 million in spin costs, is there anything you can maybe detail or break out what's going into that? Is that just continued -- is that ongoing cost? I just want to understand what's onetime, what's -- if any, and what is ongoing?

John Dietrich
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Ken, I'll start with the numbers and basically say the $200 million is the result of lower ADV and pressure on the business that's consistent with the LTL industry. Yes. With regard to the $152 million, those are spin-off preparation costs. And so those -- that's why those are in our adjusted and those are onetime costs.

Rajesh Subramaniam
President, CEO & Director

And again, if I just add one more point to it on a broader basis. Obviously, this is -- our performance is in line with our industry at this point, and this is cyclical in nature. It's very difficult to predict when the turn would come. But however, we are beginning to see some level of industry consolidation, especially in the truckload business. And while it takes a while to translate in the LTL, that process seems to have begun.

Operator

The next question is from Reed Seay with Stephens.

Reed Seay
Stephens Inc., Research Division

I want to follow up real quick on that last answer about consolidation. Does that mean consolidation of LTL carriers, you seem to think will be on the horizon? And then also in that $200 million that you talked about, there is definitely some LTL industry softness, but I was wondering if any of that is from an understandable rationalization of volume as you try to maybe take out some less profitable freight before spinning that off on its own, just if any of that is creating some noise in the shipment numbers.

Rajesh Subramaniam
President, CEO & Director

I'll start off and then John can answer the second part. I just want to make sure what I said was consolidation of capacity in the truckload business and we can see a reduction of capacity starting to happen, and that will ultimately translate into benefit for the LTL sector, even though it may take a little time. John?

John Dietrich
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And if I could talk, we're actually seeing a bit of positive inflection in the yield, the first increase in yield that we've seen in several quarters. So we're encouraged by that, and it also reflects the discipline on the pricing environment in our LTL business.

The next question is from Bruce Chan with Stifel.

J. Bruce Chan
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

So kudos to your network planning folks, certainly, plenty to keep them busy, including what might be an imminent Supreme Court ruling on the tariffs. I'm wondering if we see a decision against the administration, whether you'd view that as a tailwind to trade activity next calendar year, especially maybe in the context of your $1 billion headwind estimate. And I know that's a big question, but you all are very plugged into Washington. So any perspective there would be very helpful.

Rajesh Subramaniam
President, CEO & Director

Well, Bruce, first of all, thank you for the comments on the network. I mean these teams have done just an absolutely remarkable job and continue to do so. It's very, very early to answer any question regarding what might or might not happen on the tariff front. Any international volume increase, obviously, is beneficial, but we're not counting on any such thing in our outlook. Obviously, we are seeing significant shifts in trade and supply chain patterns and the fact that we have a scaled network in every part of the world stands to our advantage because we are able to get market signals from the bottom up, and we are able to act very quickly and with precision. And that's what's helping us very much as far as how the environment on global trade changes and how that might impact our volumes at this point. It's very early to comment, and we will update you as the months go by here.

Operator

The next question is from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies.

Stephanie Benjamin Moore
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I wanted to circle back on peak season. Maybe you could provide a little bit more color on what you've seen thus far. I know you said it's tracked in line, but I think there's been a lot of commentary at a high level that we've seen talking about K-shaped recovery and also some questions just around the strength of peak season. You also commented a little bit about maybe small business or B2B. So any additional color you can provide on peak season would be great.

Brie Carere
Executive VP & Chief Customer Officer

Stephanie, it's Brie. So I'm really pleased with how we're doing from a peak perspective, both from a planning as well as in execution. Right now, we are basically running right on our forecast for peak what we had predicted was a mid-single-digit year-over-year growth on ADV. That is absolutely the case. We do have an extra operating day. And so in total volume, you're going to see a high single-digit growth from a peak period. From a forecast perspective, as I mentioned, it is basically in line. What we are seeing, however, especially early in peak is actually our base and our small and medium businesses are slightly ahead of forecast. And our larger retailers are slightly below, which obviously, from a revenue quality perspective is a good thing from a results perspective. From a trend throughout peak, what we did see is that right after Black Friday, we had very strong, and the second week was a little bit softer, but we have seen building momentum in the last week.

Time in transit is 2 days. Scott and John are doing a remarkable job of running the network. In addition to that, as you know, we are the market share leader in large package, and the team has done a brilliant job of actually keeping the port cities clear. They've pulled that volume into kind of the middle of the country bypassing some sorts and hubs, which is really important. So right now, we feel really good about peak. I do not want to underestimate that we have still 6 days to go. We have a lot of work to do. The team is ready as Raj just talked about. I cannot say enough about the incredible airline work. But the team does need to execute next week without the MD-11, we're very focused on that, and they have demonstrated that this is definitely going to be a strong peak and could not be more pleased.

Operator

The next question is from Ari Rosa with Citigroup.

Ariel Rosa
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Nice job on the quarter here. Good to see the progress. I'm curious in the slides, you mentioned that you have 24% of volume flowing through Network 2.0 automated facilities. I think I'm remembering that correctly. I just want to understand what does that mean in terms of the margin profile for the facilities or kind of the cost structure per package on those facilities versus legacy facilities? And how should we think about the time line or the pace for that to continue to ramp? And kind of going to Tom's question, does that just mean we're looking at kind of potentially structurally higher margins going forward?

John Dietrich
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Ari. And we intend to talk a lot more about this at our upcoming Investor Day. But we also have said previously with regard to Network 2.0 benefits, we expect to see the tangible results of that later in FY '27. So I would say not a material impact financially, but great contribution from an operational efficiency standpoint that Brie was talking about earlier.

Operator

The next question is from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research.

Conor Cunningham
Melius Research LLC

I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about the health care and small and medium-sized business markets and just talk about the opportunity set that you have from here. And then Raj, you've talked a little bit in the past around just the tech pipeline or the potential there just given the CapEx that's being spent on that from the AI player. Just curious on how FedEx kind of fits into that puzzle, if at all.

Brie Carere
Executive VP & Chief Customer Officer

Conor, it's Brie. Sure. I'll start first from a health care and an SMB perspective. As we mentioned several calls ago, we had just a phenomenal build last year from a health care perspective. We have, I think, the best digital portfolio from a health care segment perspective. What do I mean by that? We can give our health care customers customized visibility and they can set their own business rules for intervention and monitoring, which is really important. All customers are important, but patients obviously require that next level of service.

As I just talked about some of the service performance, that means that we can actually intervene, reroute and adjust for health care customers at a level of precision that I just believe is unmatched in the network. So we are continuing to onboard health care with that tool. We also rolled out a new quality program which is really important to the pharma segment. That is sort of early days. That actually requires with each one of our pharma customers for us to work with their quality team, build out a custom SOP, prove we can execute that to be able to win share of wallet, and that is going quite well.

So that will continue, I believe, the ability to take share. And then from there, we're also continuing to expand our cold chain capabilities. Right now, we've got great cold chain in a reactive place. And what do I mean by that? Most of our customers are packing out their shipments. And so we use cold chain predominantly to intervene and ice something or refreeze something if there is a delay in the system. We're moving to end-to-end cold chain. So that's sort of the next wave. Had great momentum here in the United States. We're taking these capabilities to Europe and to Asia. So I think we've got a long runway we've got between $9 billion and $10 billion of health care in our base. The market is $70 billion. So this is a long-term strategy, but the team continues to execute every quarter.

From an SMB perspective, we are, I think, the easiest to do business in the United States. We just had the best quarter in SMB share and performance that I have seen in several years, a huge shout out to both our sales and marketing team. And again, we're going to keep chipping away at this. And I believe with our value proposition, we'll continue to take share. And then finally, on the data center. While it's not as big an opportunity as health care, health care is $70 billion, the data center market is probably between $7 billion and $8 billion, it is rapidly growing. I think global CapEx is predicted to be like $550 billion. In a market that is moving that quickly, there is opportunity. This market expects precision. I don't know anybody who does Precision better than we do. So yes, we're winning now, but I think there's a long road ahead of more opportunity.

The next question is from David Vernon with Bernstein.

David Vernon
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

So John, coming back to the question on the Network 2.0 stuff, right? I think you guys had mentioned before you were looking at 40% of the volume by the end of FY '26 running in an integrated facility. I'm trying to sort of reconcile that with the idea that margins are just going to be up a little. I thought the idea was that when you get the integration done, you're going to be running at a higher level of productivity, and that would flow through to margin. But I think I heard you maybe say that the financial impact maybe wasn't as great. I'm just trying to kind of get my head around that.

Rajesh Subramaniam
President, CEO & Director

Let me just give you the latest and greatest on what we expect on Network 2.0. As we said we are right now 24% of the volume pre-peak. By the time next peak rolls around, we'll be around 65%. And that's the plan and that's what we're executing against. At the end of the day, when we are finished with it, we're targeting around a 30% footprint reduction by the end of fiscal year '27. And those represent, along with One FedEx, $2 billion in cost savings. And we see the majority of the savings skewed towards FY '27. I don't know, John, if you want to add anything more than that.

John Dietrich
Executive VP & CFO

No. I would just add with regard to our transformational cost savings targets for this year, there are elements of Network 2.0 included in those and that's what I want to elaborate further on at Investor Day. I don't want to say there's no savings. It's all part and parcel. We'll go into much more detail on our strategic initiatives, including Network 2.0 when we'll see you in February.

The next question is from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners.

Jeffrey Kauffman
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

A lot of my questions have been answered, but let me ask one for John here. John, thank you for explaining the headwinds on the incremental second half outlook. I want to ask about the non-GAAP add-backs. You had a nice chart in the release showing about $720 million net this year, $600 from the spin, $310 million from business optimization. You still have about $450 million of that to go and 2 quarters to do it. Can you give us an idea of kind of how that's going to weigh? Like did you not do as much Network 2.0 integration because of peak season this quarter and you're going to do more in the fiscal third quarter? Kind of how should we think about the flow of those expenses?

John Dietrich
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I think the overwhelming majority of them are going to be tied to our freight separation. We also have a much smaller portion with regard to the change in our calendar fiscal year. And also finally, a much smaller portion with the ongoing business optimization that has been in play for the last couple of years. So -- but freight separation is the overwhelming majority.

This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Raj Subramaniam for any closing remarks.

Rajesh Subramaniam
President, CEO & Director

Well, thank you, operator. Before we go, I want to acknowledge how proud and humbled we are by the Memphis-Shelby County Airport Authority's decision today to rename the Memphis International Airport in honor of our founder, Frederick W. Smith. It's a fitting tribute to the man who launched FedEx, a company that revolutionized the airport, the city of Memphis and the way the world works. We look forward to soon operating our largest hub out of Frederick W. Smith International Airport.

And finally, a big thank you to Team FedEx for your outstanding work in Q2 and throughout this peak season with just one more week to go. Happy holidays, everyone. Thank you.
