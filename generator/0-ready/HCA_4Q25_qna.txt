[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS.

Albert Rice
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I wondered maybe the focus is on the top line, of course, in your comments. Can you talk about the expense items, SWB, supplies, other operating expenses, professional fees, et cetera? What are you -- what are your underlying assumptions there that are embedded in the guidance? Is there margin improvement opportunities on any of those lines in '26?

Mike Marks
CFO & Executive VP

When I look at the margin, and I noted this in my comments, but the midpoint of our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance range suggests expectations for pretty stable margins in '26 versus '25. As we noted on our third quarter call, we continue to expect mostly stable trends in our operating costs, consistent with the last couple of years. I might note that we do see and expect continued physician cost pressures and believe that those could even be maybe in the high single digits growth in '26 versus '25. So those would be kind of some comments on the cost side of our guidance.

Albert Rice
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. In the contract labor and just general labor, that's steady year-to-year is the underlying assumption?

Mike Marks
CFO & Executive VP

It is. I mean the only thing I might mention is that the contract labor as a percent of SWB, we came in at about 4.2% for the fourth quarter. And that feels like kind of our run rate now as we come into 2026. But other than that, I mean, the resiliency plan is reflected in our guidance, as I noted in my comments. And largely, the resiliency plan is there to help us offset as much of the adverse impact of the exchange headwinds as possible. And you see that in our guidance as well. And I think it reflects really strong cost and operating leverage as we head into 2026.

Your next question comes from the line of Ann Hynes with Mizuho.

Ann Hynes
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

So it sounds like the net negative headwind from ACA subsidies is in the $200 million to $500 million range. Can you just go into more of the resiliency programs and provide some more detail on what's making up that $400 million and obviously, the confidence in executing throughout the year just from a timing perspective and when you expect to lose potential volume?

Mike Marks
CFO & Executive VP

Sure. I'll start with resiliency, and I'll pick up the second part, [ end ] of your question related to the exchanges. But as we've talked about over the last really year plus, we have been implementing steps to try to mitigate the impact of this health insurance exchange headwind. We've been working to both enhance and accelerate our financial resiliency program. I would make a couple of contextual notes related to our program. The first is that our program has 4 key areas of focus: revenue integrity, variable and fixed cost efficiencies and capacity management. We are leveraging 3 primary capabilities in driving our financial resiliency program.

First, internal and external benchmarking and advanced analytics; second, digital transformation with AI and automation; and third, expanding and leveraging our shared service platforms. Our 2026 plan includes significant efforts at corporate, in our large shared service platforms and in our hospital operations. We have planned elements to drive better capacity management, including managing throughput and length of stay in our inpatient settings and our emergency rooms and our operating rooms.

On the cost side, we have robust plans to drive labor efficiency, supply cost actions and operating costs covering both variable and fixed costs. We're proud of our teams, and I think they have done a wonderful job embracing resiliency as a strategic imperative. And we have confidence that we'll be able to execute on this $400 million of incremental cost savings in '26 versus '25.

A little bit more on your question related to HICS. And let me just say this. Our estimated range, as I noted in my comments, of $600 million to $900 million adverse impact to EBITDA includes the potential impacts from administrative reforms that were passed as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and enacted through rulemaking as well as expiration of the EPTCs. And so as a reminder, our health exchange volumes represent approximately 8% of admissions and 10% of revenue in 2025. And the estimate impact centers around some key variables that are included in our calculations.

First, how many people lose exchange coverage. And what form of coverage, if any, do those lives migrate to? And for those retaining coverage, is there a change in metal tier or utilization? As you can imagine, assumptions around the variables are informed through our own data and experience as well as incorporating external studies and analysis. These variables are difficult to predict and require significant judgments. Our model contemplates a 15% to 20% decline in our HICS volumes for 2026. We assume this volume will migrate to either employee-sponsored insurance or to uninsured.

Of the decline in our HICS volumes, we assume approximately 15% to 20% will move to employee-sponsored coverage, which carries a benefit with the remaining migrating to uninsured, which includes a decline in utilization from those individuals no longer having coverage.

From a timing perspective, we are watching the enrollment figures carefully. As you know, they were released recently by CMS. But these recently released enrollment data include a couple of key areas that will dictate the timing of the impact. And the first one is whether people can pay and sustain their premiums, given the significant increase they are facing from EPTC expiration. The second one is if there will be a metal tier shift from silver to bronze and the impact on utilization and collectibility of our patient due balances. So we're watching these trends carefully as we go through the opening days, weeks and months of 2026, and we will keep you informed as they play out during 2026 on our quarterly calls.

Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.

Pito Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

A 2026 guidance question here, just are there any one-timers we should be adjusting out for 2025? But if you take the baseline of '25 and pull out, I think, $450 million to $900 million from HICS and supplemental payments, offset by the resiliency programs, I just want to make sure that I'm calculating the core growth of what HCA is doing at sort of 3% to 12%, with 7% at the midpoint versus just your long-term guidance of 4% to 6%. So you're still guiding core above your long-term guidance?

Mike Marks
CFO & Executive VP

Let me say, I think from a range perspective that I would just reiterate 2 or 3 of the moving parts for clarity. We've noted the range of potential adverse impact from the exchanges of $600 million to $900 million. We've noted that we believe that the supplemental payments could have a $250 million to $450 million decline in net benefit and that, that decline in net benefit does not include any potential new approvals of grandfathered applications by CMS. And lastly, resiliency, we are confident that we'll be able to execute on our plans for 2026 given the $400 million target. So I think in taking those kind of swing factors into account, Pito, we do agree, and we're pleased with the strength and the performance of the company and the momentum of the company as we go into 2026.

Pito Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And then if you can size up the potential of all the approvals come through, how much that could add to '26 EBITDA?

Mike Marks
CFO & Executive VP

Yes, we're not sizing the potential approvals until we get a sense of the actual approval from CMS and what changes, if any, they make through their review and approval processes. So not quite sizing that yet.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.

Unknown Analyst

This is [ Anna ] on for Justin. I just wanted to ask the $400 million of resiliency benefit in '26 is impressive. Can you talk about how much of that comes from ramping AI initiatives and how we should think about further resiliency opportunities beyond 2026 as some of the Medicaid cuts begin in the out years?

Mike Marks
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. And we've mentioned this before. But I think the way to think about our resiliency program is that it's a multiyear program. The $400 million came from our assessment of implementation status of the long list of opportunities that we're working on. And based on that assessment of our implementation status, it gave us confidence to include $400 million of savings in '26 versus '25 in our overall guidance.

As we move forward, we continue to work on our resiliency plan. It's a program, and I mentioned on the previous question, components that we're working on. But we're really pleased with the depth and breadth of our resiliency program and believe that it gives us good support here as we move through the back half of the decade.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with Leerink Partners.

Benjamin Mayo
Leerink Partners LLC, Research Division

You guys have been working on some digital efforts with payers recently, I think at least some of the large national ones around data and disputes. Can you maybe talk about that and how it's manifesting into revenue cycle, yield, collections or pricing or maybe just reduced payer friction?

Mike Marks
CFO & Executive VP

Sure. Whit, thank you. We have, over the last year, have launched a series of engagements with many of our major payers. And these engagements kind of focus on digital integration. So think about electronic data exchange, think about the kinds of activities that HCA and our payers can partner on to produce administrative simplification. And I think they also include dispute resolution and trying to do -- find better ways to resolve disputes between the parties. We're pleased with these engagements. And I think it gives us strength in our overall relationships with payers.

And frankly, we continue to work with our payers to find ways to make things better for their members and our patients and to digitize the whole workflow between ourselves and our payer partners. So I think overall, these engagements have produced good progress with the relationship between us and our payers. And so we're excited as we head into 2026 to continue to work with these -- with our payers on these initiatives.

Benjamin Mayo
Leerink Partners LLC, Research Division

And Mike, speak to the working capital improvement this year, which are part and parcel to some of that, not entirely all of it, but I think that is reflected in the cash flow production that the company had and then our working capital improved this year.

Mike Marks
CFO & Executive VP

For sure. I mean we had a nice reduction in net days in AR, especially in the fourth quarter. And that really reflects the benefits of sharing data and exchanging data from payers digitally and certainly is a part of what's driving those enhancements.

So I think the efforts here are clearly on administrative simplification. I do think they have impacts on our revenue cycle, both in terms of getting claims paid more timely, but also through potential mitigation of denials and disputes, which is beneficial for both us and our payers.

Samuel Hazen
CEO & Director

And Mike, let me add to just the whole resiliency agenda. This is not an episodic event for us. It just happens to be a maturation of what in my estimation is cultural within HCA, and that is being cost effective in finding ways to leverage scale, utilize best practices. Now we have tools, as Mike alluded to, that are in front of us as opportunities to create even more consistency, efficiencies and transparency in the company's overall cost. And that's why the program is lining up in a well-timed manner with some of the enhanced premium tax credit challenges.

But we see this program continuing to mature. And as we get more capable at using these tools, it's going to help us find even more opportunities. But this is not a onetime event. It's a cultural dynamic in our company around being cost effective, being high quality and finding ways to improve from a process standpoint and a leverage standpoint with our overall scale.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.

Brian Tanquilut
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Congrats on the quarter and the guidance. Mike, as I think about just the rural benefit from One Big Beautiful Bill, I was curious if you have any updated thoughts [indiscernible] they finalized some of the rules there. And then just any call outs in Q1 that we [ should ] think about other than sort of the tough comp that we should be contemplating?

Mike Marks
CFO & Executive VP

On the Rural Health Transformation program under the One Beautiful Bill Act, all 50 states have been allocated their program funding, but these are largely state-driven programs, and most of the details have not yet been released. We do not yet know the timing, the structure or the size of any state level awards or how much of the funding will be distributed within each state. So our approach, Brian, has been to really stay actively engaged with our state and federal partners regarding both the program design and then our response to program design to ensure that once the applications are open, that we will participate in a way that's meaningful.

At this stage, we do view the Rural Health Transformation Fund as a potential opportunity, but it's not something that we have reflected in our guidance given the remaining uncertainty. When I think about the quarter, we had a strong quarter. We noted that there's maybe one part of that, that was a little different than we anticipated when we gave our third quarter update, and that's the state supplemental payments. You may recall that on our third quarter update, we thought we would finish the full year at $300 million net benefit in state supplemental payment programs for the quarter -- for the year of 2025 because we were anticipating a year-over-year decline in fourth quarter given some known headwinds from the prior year.

We ended up getting a retro payment from Virginia in the fourth quarter, which kind of pushed us flat in the quarter and led us up to a $420 million net benefit for the full year. So that's about the -- that's the only thing I can think of, Brian, that would be a little different than we anticipated when we gave our update for guidance in our third quarter call. I mean volumes came in largely where we anticipated. We -- our rates were stable, a stable operating environment with rates. And our expense management, I thought was really good in the quarter. So overall, we deem our fourth quarter performance as being strong.

Samuel Hazen
CEO & Director

Mike, let me add to the rural discussion, just 1 minute here. Roughly 15% of our hospitals, we believe, are rural hospitals of some sort. And so that's a large footprint that we have that's complementary to the networks across the company. And so we have a number of assets in rural communities. Secondly, we have a number of programs where our health systems from one community to the other provide services in rural communities, whether it's telemedicine, transport systems, satellite clinic with our physicians, urgent care, whatever. And so that's another vehicle.

The third piece for us is workforce. Our graduate medical education programs, even our nursing rotations with our Galen College of Nursing programs create opportunities for us to, we believe, participate in the programs. But as Mike said, we're having to work through roughly 20 different programs in our company to understand how those funds are going to be applied. But we do think we have elements of the company that are in rural America in a way that deserves funding through these programs.

Your next question comes from the line of Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets.

Benjamin Hendrix
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I was wondering if you could provide some thoughts on the potential for a transition to a health savings account construct for the enhanced subsidies. Assuming those funds go directly to customer HSAs, is there any initial thoughts you have on how that would impact your current assessment of the EPTC expiry headwinds? And then how should we think about the impact on uncompensated care as [ some patients ] have access to the funds but may not be purchasing insurance?

Mike Marks
CFO & Executive VP

So Ben, I think as you think about President Trump's health care plan announcement last week, I think the plan, as we understand it, was really aimed at improving affordability. The themes seem to be including insurance plan

[Technical Difficulty]

pharmaceutical prices increasing price transparency. And to your point, potentially changing the way that instead of exchanges with tax credits maybe a little bit more related to cash coming into health care savings accounts. It's a little early to get a sense for what aspects of that plan will come to fruition. We're monitoring it, as you can imagine, closely, as Congress pick those up and decides how they will react. So at this point, it's a little early to try to size potential impacts related to those kinds of potential changes. We're just going to see how they flow through Congress and see what comes. But obviously, we're monitoring it just like you are, and we'll update as we know more.

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Gillmor with KeyBanc.

Matthew Gillmor
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I want to follow up on the exchange discussion for '26. Can you give us a sense for how the exchange reforms and subsidy expirations will impact the volume outlook? I'm curious if there's a drag that's being absorbed within the 2% to 3% volume outlook from the exchange expiration. And can you also give us a sense for how you're thinking about the decline in utilization from folks that moved to uninsured within your outlook?

Mike Marks
CFO & Executive VP

Sure. So if you just think about the modeling, and again, I think it's important to always start with context. This modeling, these judgments are significant, and they're early. And so part of our work as we go through the next days, weeks and months will be to test these assumptions against our actual experience. And so we're going to know more, Matthew, at the end of first quarter into second quarter, and we will keep you updated as we learn more.

But yes, I do think that the overall volume of the company, although it's within that range of 2% to 3% has an impact here on exchanges. And if you think about the walk-through of the math, and so I'll just go back through it because I think it's instructive, we contemplate a 15% to 20% decline in our HICS volumes in 2026. And that this volume will migrate to either employee-sponsored insurance or to uninsured. Of the decline in our volume, we assume approximately 15% to 20% of those people will end up with employee-sponsored insurance coverage, which does carry a benefit. But the remaining will go to uninsured.

And for the ones that go to uninsured, we do anticipate a decline in utilization from those individuals no longer having coverage. And we believe that, that decline is somewhere in the 30% range compared to their utilization of the health care services when they had health care insurance through the exchanges. The only other thing I might mention with the exchange population is we find that they tend to utilize the emergency room in a way that's heavier than our traditional managed care or commercial population. And so clearly, that's -- the folks that become uninsured, even with the slight decline of utilization, that population as well almost entirely uses the emergency room. So those will be some additional comments on the impact on volume.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Mok with Barclays.

Andrew Mok
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Outpatient surgeries declined year-over-year on a negative comp and moderated from the previous quarter. Can you elaborate on what you saw there and if there are any payer categories you would call out driving some of that volume pressure?

Mike Marks
CFO & Executive VP

Andrew, absolutely. If I pull [indiscernible] just outpatient surgery, let me just talk about outpatient in general first, and then we'll touch surgery. But overall, on the outpatient side, we were pleased with our outpatient revenue growth, which actually grew at a rate higher than our inpatient revenue growth. As a reminder, we kind of characterize our outpatient revenue into 4 categories: emergency services, outpatient surgery, which includes both hospital-based and ASCs, our ambulatory platforms, which include physician clinics and urgent care clinics and other hospital-based outpatient services, including cardiology, diagnostics and the like. All 4 categories experienced solid revenue growth over prior year in the quarter.

A couple of notes on outpatient surgery specifically. Our same facility cases were down about 50 basis points in fourth quarter over prior year, with hospitals being about flat and ASCs down about 1.5%. Payer mix, though, continued to be solid with declines to prior year primarily driven by Medicaid. In addition to the payer mix environment, we saw a decline in lower intensity cases like ENT. So as a result, we had good growth in net revenue and earnings in our outpatient surgery business overall, inclusive of both the hospitals and the ambulatory surgery center platform.

Samuel Hazen
CEO & Director

And Mike, let me just add to just the whole outpatient discussion. We continue to invest significantly in outpatient facility development. Just this past year, we added roughly 100 business units to our outpatient footprint across the company. And we find ourselves heading into 2026 and 2027 with significant capital in the pipeline that's geared toward, yes, some inpatient capacity and inpatient capabilities, but also quite a bit of outpatient development.

Moreover, I would suggest that we have a better pipeline for acquisition opportunities inside of our outpatient footprint than we've seen in a few years, again, allowing us to complement the existing networks that we have. And so when we look at overall revenue production of the company, I think, Mike, in the fourth quarter, our outpatient revenue as a percent of total was actually up on a year-over-year basis. Some of that is due to the components that Mike laid out, but it's also due to the fact that we're adding units at a greater pace than we are, obviously, our inpatient hospitals.

And so the combination of that, we think, is important to our overall network resiliency. And by that, we mean creating an environment where patients have easier access into the HCA Healthcare system and our payers actually have better price points for their members such that they can get into the system with urgent care or physician clinic or an ambulatory surgery center in a manner that is most productive for them as a patient, but also for their insurance company.

So we're pretty excited about the overall construct that's evolving for our company. I think today, we have about 2,700 outpatient facilities or so. That continues to grow, and we see that pushing toward our targets of 18 to 20 outpatient facilities per hospital as we finish out this decade. And that, again, will come through capital development in greenfield projects, but also acquisitions that make sense for us strategically.

Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald.

Gabrielle Ingoglia
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

It's Gabie on for Sarah. I just wanted to double-click on the payer mix. And if you can share any color on how it played out compared to your internal expectations, specifically Medicaid inflecting positively for the first time in 2025 and if that's something you expect to persist?

Mike Marks
CFO & Executive VP

Yes, good question. So when I think about fourth quarter volume and the composition, and I mentioned this in the call, I think on the exchange side, we had a 2.5% growth. We were actually down a smidge sequentially from third quarter to fourth quarter. I think that really reflects a couple of things. One, and this also impacted Medicaid is just the timing of the Medicaid redetermination process in the prior year. So we think we have fully sunsetted that time line in prior year. And so you saw less exchange growth and you also saw a bit more Medicaid volume and Medicaid of 2.2% growth over prior year. It seems to be now back to kind of a normal growth rate more consistent with our overall volume growth rate for Medicaid.

And the health care exchanges, clearly, we did not see a pull forward of demand as people were anticipating premium increases, but the 2.5% growth, we do believe reflects that timing of the Medicaid redetermination process in prior year. Otherwise, I think we were generally pleased with our payer mix in the quarter and our overall volume growth. I mean, Medicare up 3.5% and total equivalent admissions up 2.5%, I think, really reflects a solid demand for the company as we finish the year.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Langston with TD Cowen.

Ryan Langston
TD Cowen, Research Division

I guess with the balance sheet in a pretty good place and maybe fair to expect smaller hospitals and health systems seeing more detrimental impact from subsidy expiration and impact of the One BBB. I guess now that the subsidies are expired, can you give us a sense on your M&A opportunities if that pipeline is bigger, smaller, size of the assets? And then maybe kind of touch on capital budget priorities for 2026?

Samuel Hazen
CEO & Director

So as I just mentioned -- this is Sam. We have seen some acceleration in the outpatient space in our pipeline through acquisitions is a little greater than it's been in past years. And we continue to execute on those appropriately, assuming we can get to a reasonable deal, and we've been able to accomplish that in certain circumstances. So from that standpoint, that's been what we've seen mostly in the market is in-market type transactions that are complementary to the network and again, create a better patient offering for us overall.

With respect to hospitals and tax-exempt hospitals specifically, we just haven't seen it yet that there is a significant opportunity for the company that makes sense from a financial standpoint. We continue to be well positioned, as you just mentioned, with our balance sheet being in a great position, the capabilities of the company as a scaled player allows us to assimilate individual hospitals or hospital systems synergistically, but we haven't seen it. And so we obviously are open to those type of transactions if and when they present themselves. We're fortunate, as we've mentioned in the past, that we do have great markets within HCA's portfolio overall.

And the opportunities to invest in those markets organically is compelling. And we've been able to do that, again, in our outpatient space, but also with our hospitals. Our hospitals are running 73%, 74% occupancy. We have many strategic positioned hospitals that need capital. I think our capital is at an all-time high for approved projects that will come online in '26, '27, maybe early '28. It's almost $7 billion of capital that's in the pipeline. Mike alluded to the fact that we're lifting our capital spending because of those circumstances to somewhere between $5 billion and $5.5 billion, and we will continue to evaluate that. So we're finding ways to invest productively as well as use our assets productively with acquisitions where appropriate, investing in our networks and then looking for out -- in-market opportunities if, in fact, they do present themselves in an appropriate way.

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Goldman Sachs.

Scott Fidel
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Curious if you can talk a bit about your expectations for growth in terms of specialties and procedures in 2026. Maybe talk about some of the areas where you're expecting outsized procedure growth around some of the categories that we've certainly seen the company investing in and then also just underlying growth due to different trends that we're seeing in the market.

Samuel Hazen
CEO & Director

This is Sam. We said this in the past, and we have a geography that's diversified in the sense that no one division in HCA generates more than 10% of the profits of the company. We also have similar diversification, if you will, in services in that no specific service line generates any more than 15% of the revenue of the company.

So given that, we haven't seen anything that's disproportionate vis-a-vis one other service line. I will tell you that we've seen reasonable demand for cardiac services. Some of that's technology-driven in electrophysiology. We continue to believe that, that pattern will persist into 2026. Obviously, within our emergency room -- we continue to believe that our emergency room services are a very important component to community health and at the same time to our networks. And so we're investing in our emergency rooms, both from a patient care standpoint, an operational throughput standpoint as well as the supply standpoint to make sure we have sufficient resources in that particular area.

And then within surgeries, I mean we do have specific efforts afoot, but they're more generic, if you will. They're not necessarily specialty oriented. I will tell you that our case mix continues to grow, and that growth is driven, we believe, by the acuity of the patients in many instances in our medical space. So we see a lot of patients who have intense medical needs, creating more acute care requirements, whether it's intensive care or deeper med-surg capabilities, and that's part of what is going on in the communities that we serve as well. So that's a bit of an overview. I don't have any other specifics for 2026 around different categories of growth that we expect, but we can try to get that to you if that's something that would be helpful.

Raj Kumar
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Maybe just in light of the kind of recent winter storm, maybe any operational disruptions to call out? And maybe kind of any considerations for the 1Q relative to annual guidance that we should be kind of thinking about related to any potential impacts there?

Samuel Hazen
CEO & Director

Well, it looks like Armageddon out here in Nashville right now. So to say that we're aware of what the impacts are going to be at this point, we're not. I mean we've had snowstorms before we had a massive storm in Texas a few years ago, and we were able to navigate through that. My sense is as we close out January, we'll have some sense of the impact of the storm here in Nashville as well as a few other markets for the company. But I don't think it's as significant in most other markets as we maybe are experiencing here. Having said that, we have plenty of opportunity, I think, to recover some of the challenges that are typical for these type of storms.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Baxter with Wells Fargo.

Stephen Baxter
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Could you expand a little bit on the paused Texas Medicaid supplemental payment that was mentioned during the guidance color? I guess what exactly is happening there? And what needs to happen for that payment to come back online in 2026? And how much, I guess, of the year-over-year impact is that driving?

Mike Marks
CFO & Executive VP

So the paused program is called ATLIS, stands for Aligning Technology by Linking Interoperable Systems. There was a commissioner that issued a termination notice on that program on their way out as they were leaving office. The new Executive Commissioner that has -- is now in place has agreed to review that program, effectively putting it on pause versus terminating. We don't know yet the time line for this review, but we are encouraged that the department is willing to review the program and consider a potential reinstatement.

From a sizing standpoint, when I think about the overall guidance for '26, and we've highlighted a $250 million to $450 million decline in net benefit from state supplemental payments. This Texas pause is about 1/3 of that decline. The other 2 that we noted that are the other 2/3 of that decline, one would be the retro payment from Virginia that we received in fourth quarter of 2025. And then second is the Tennessee program where we had 6 quarters of benefit in '25 and only 4 quarters of benefit in '26. So that's the -- each of those 3 items are about 1/3 of that decline of $250 million to $450 million.

Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research.

Joshua Raskin
Nephron Research LLC

I know this came up a little bit, but can you speak to your technology agenda and where you think the greatest opportunities are for HCA? And specifically interested in areas where you think AI can help already looking at both the administrative costs, but also as well as the revenue enhancement opportunities.

Samuel Hazen
CEO & Director

So we are investing, as Mike said, heavily in our tech agenda. And it's got multiple components to it. We're investing in our electronic health record transition from one system to another, and we're accelerating into that platform. That's a very important foundational piece for our company in that we're going to be able to standardize datasets across all of our hospitals.

Heretofore, our hospitals had a variable dataset that created some challenges for us when we were using the big data. And big data for us, we believe, is the next scalable asset inside of HCA to produce better performance broadly. So we've organized ourselves into 3 domains. And we are extremely energized by the possibilities here in each of the domains.

The first domain is administrative, and you alluded to that. That is an area that's focused on revenue cycle, human resources, IT, supply chain in many instances and a few other areas that we think we can accelerate into because we're more consolidated in our operations. And so we're implementing as we speak in our revenue cycle and supply chain and other areas to move through some transitions into artificial intelligence, supporting better functioning, more efficiencies, better interaction with payers and vendors and so forth. And we should start to see some value, and that's part of what Mike alluded to again in our resiliency agenda in 2026.

The second domain for us is what we're calling operational. And that's where we're delegating operational responsibilities to each of our hospitals and facilities. Here again, we have areas of focus that we think are going to create incremental value for the company and allow us to be better at throughput, asset productivity, scheduling and staffing our hospitals, scheduling and running our ORs and so forth. And so again, a lot of good ideas and a lot of tools that we think AI can bring to the operations of our hospital, allowing us to be a little bit more standardized, allowing us to be a little bit more consistent in performance and then giving our management teams greater tools to run their business even better than they do today, and they run it incredibly well currently.

The third area is what we've called the Holy Grail. And the Holy Grail for us is really centered around clinical and what we can do to support our doctors with insights that come from the patterns that we know exist in the services that we offer because of our volume. We believe with HCA's proprietary database, that we have a wonderful opportunity to use those patterns to help our physicians in the moment, make better decisions, more informed decisions potentially for their patients in a way that will improve care.

The second thing on the clinical side is nursing. The opportunity to support our nurses with tools that make it easier for them to do shift change, to have a safety net underneath their day-to-day activities so they can make the patient environment safer and more efficient is in front of us. And again, we have some solutions that we're implementing this year. Our leadership challenge and our leadership responsibility is to help our facilities manage this change, get to the other side of it so that we can create value for our patients, value for our facilities and ultimately, value for the organization. We are all in on the possibilities with artificial intelligence merging with what I call the human intelligence that exists within our facilities. And if we can put that together in an appropriate way, and we think we can, we see a lot of value potential across quality, efficiency and just management effectiveness.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Cassorla with Guggenheim.

Maybe asking the payer mix questions in a little bit of a different way. I know you've talked with the exchange enrollment kind of transitioning into uninsured. But can you give us a sense in terms of what 2026 guidance assumes for overall bad debt and uncompensated care and how that compares to 2025 levels? And perhaps if there's offsets at the external level in terms of state uncompensated care pools or programs that you could tap into as offsets there?

Mike Marks
CFO & Executive VP

Well, I would say that our assumptions in our guidance certainly include this movement for the people who lose the exchange coverage, the ones who don't go to employee-sponsored insurance will likely become uninsured. And for the -- if you just think about kind of that component, when someone enters our hospitals and they're uninsured, we do anticipate it's inherent in our guidance that we'll see an increase in the amount of people who are entering our facilities with no insurance in '26 versus '25. And that is part of the math that I walked through earlier. As you know, when someone with that insurance comes into the hospital, I mean, largely, those patients are reserved right away, right? So that growth kind of immediately transitions into uncompensated care.

The other component that we're studying carefully is the amount that patients owe when they do have insurance. And so within the exchanges, I think the potential impact here is when someone goes from silver to bronze. And if we see a significant movement in metal tiers from silver, I do think there is a potential for there to be a bit more due from patients. That's our past experience is that the folks on the exchanges owe a bit more than people with traditional managed care.

And then when we think about collectability, the collectibility of patient balances within the metal tiers on the exchanges, the bronze enrollees have a lower collection rate than the silver. And our modeling and based on our past experience with silver and bronze, I would say that the -- our belief is that the impact to patient balance collections appear to be relatively immaterial. And so overall, I think the bigger impact will be just the growth in the uninsured versus the uncollectibility of patient balances due as people go from silver to bronze. Again, lot of modeling assumptions in that, a lot of judgments in that, that we're going to have to test as we go through the first weeks, days and months of 2026, but that's our current thinking.

Coby, let's take one more question [ given it's ] almost an hour.

Operator

Okay. Your last question will come from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.

Kevin Fischbeck
BofA Securities, Research Division

Maybe just one clarification on that last point. And then -- so what is the collection rate on like a bronze versus a silver just so that we can think about it? But then I guess, more importantly, you guys have been over 20% margin last year, this year, even though you've got these headwinds coming in. We kind of think about 20% margin is kind of the high end for you guys, but you're outcompeting that even with pressure. So how do you think about what kind of margin HCA can point to? You sound pretty bullish about cost savings going forward. Should we be thinking about something north of 20% as a sustainable margin for HCA?

Mike Marks
CFO & Executive VP

Well, let's start with '26. I mean I think given the headwinds from the exchanges and from supplemental payments and the fact that we've been able to develop and implement a resiliency program that has allowed us to offset as much of that as we can, we're really pleased with the guidance around margin, which we've been able to get pretty consistent with where we landed 2025. That obviously reflects a ton of hard work in our resiliency plan, our ability to drive operating leverage through our volume growth and our overall cost management activities as a company. It's a little premature to talk about what could happen in the future other than to just point you back to my comments, Kevin, where we noted that given the demand in our marketplaces, our resiliency programs and the digital transformation that Sam just talked about that we are comfortable that we will be able to maintain our long-term plan over time. And so I think that's a good sense of the confidence we have in the company and our performance. So I think we'll end there. Frank?

Frank Morgan
Vice President of Investor Relations

Okay. Thank you, Coby, for your help today, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call. We hope you have a good earnings season. We are around this afternoon if we can answer any additional questions. Thank you.
