[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird.

Craig Kennison
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Mike, a lot of optimism building around the 2026 retail consumer driven by lower rates and tax policy. What signals are you looking for to ascertain whether your end markets might grow for the first time since the pandemic?

Michael Happe
CEO, President & Director

Yes, the retail environment, as Bryan Hughes indicated in his comments, continues to be soft and tempered here in the fall, early winter, the last few months of 2025. But as you well know, we are hitting into our retail show season really in the January and February, even early March periods where we hit the retail shows hard with our RV and Marine brands. And so certainly, one sign we'll be looking for here in the next 30 to 90 days is the foot traffic, but more importantly, the retail appetite from consumers at these shows.

The other note that I would probably include would be reception to the new products that our teams are bringing to the market. We have a slate of new products across many of our brands, and we'll be monitoring carefully the consumer and dealer reception candidly to those new products in the near future. So as you well know, the early parts of the calendar year are important barometers for the industries that we compete in, and by the time we show up on our next call in March, we'll certainly obviously have a good understanding as to retail prospects in calendar '26.

Bryan Hughes
SVP of Investor Relations, Finance, Information Technology and Business Development & CFO

Craig, I'll just add. We continue to monitor, as you would expect, a basket of macro indicators, certainly helpful to have interest rates reduced but lower gas prices, housing starts, we had a good inflation reading and then certainly and probably most importantly, consumer sentiment. We'll keep a close eye on that as well. All these things will certainly weigh-in and contribute to an improved retail environment, as you would expect.

Craig Kennison
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

And if I could, on a follow-up. I know you've got some affordable units in the market now that chase a new price point in a new consumer. But I'm wondering if you can look at your portfolio of customers today and wonder -- I guess I'm wondering when we might see an upgrade cycle. It feels like that has been deferred much like the housing market, but you should be pretty well positioned as consumers look for higher quality. And I'm wondering if you're seeing any of that in your checks or data.

Michael Happe
CEO, President & Director

Craig, we agree with your sentiments about the deferral of an upgrade cycle that seems to have taken place over the last couple of years. I think many of our industry peers are also thinking the same thing. We are not seeing probably yet any signs of that upgrade cycle, taking off with any significant momentum. Again, we'll see if that happens in the early to first half of '26. As you said, I mean, our brands are positioned better from an accessibility standpoint for a first time or younger or more cost-conscious buyers. But we are absolutely well positioned for those consumers that are looking for a step up in product to especially products that offer innovation quality and a great aftermarket customer experience as well. So optimistic that as the cycle eventually turns upward that our product lineups and brands are well positioned.

Our next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James.

Joseph Altobello
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

First question on the Towable business. It looks like incremental margins we're pretty light this quarter. I think revenue was up almost $40 million. Year-over-year, operating income was up about $2 million. I know you guys called out higher warranty expense, but what were the big driver or drivers of that?

Bryan Hughes
SVP of Investor Relations, Finance, Information Technology and Business Development & CFO

Yes. Joe, this is Bryan. Warranty was certainly one of the drivers. We continue to have some mix that we are seeing as headwinds as well. I'd say those are the primary drivers. Down at this level of volume, a lot of the equation is leverage. We did have growth, as you pointed out, which contributed favorably. But overall, I think those are the drivers. It's mix, and it is that higher warranty expense.

Joseph Altobello
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Got it. Okay. And just in terms of the guidance for this year, if I look at your industry shipment outlook, it's call it, at least at the midpoint, a little bit of decline in calendar '26. What sort of market share trends on the RV side are you guys baking into that guidance?

Michael Happe
CEO, President & Director

Craig, we are -- or excuse me, Joe, this is Mike. We are absolutely looking to drive a little bit of market share in fiscal '26. It will be in areas like Super Cs from Newmar and Grand Design. The Winnebago Towables brands should see some share lift as well. We anticipate obviously share increases with some of our Grand Design travel trailers, Transcend brand specifically.

And then when you get to the Marine side, Barletta continues to show very strong market share growth even in recent individual months that haven't been reported, I'm quite confident that you'll see Barletta stand-alone monthly market share continue to be at very impressive levels.

I do want to emphasize, Joe, that we have been very consistent since the call in October and including the call this morning that much of our increase in earnings from fiscal '25 to fiscal '26 is within our control. And while we are somewhat conservative on our industry wholesale shipment assumptions that we're sharing, we view any upside to the number that we're sharing as something that could flow through to our financials in the future.

We are executing the controllables here at Winnebago Industries, operational discipline. We have significant cost improvement, margin improvement initiatives that are happening, new products that are being launched that we believe will both drive share, but also potentially add some profitability as well. So our plan is really based this fiscal year on what we can control, and we'll certainly be agile should the market grow or even decline versus our current assumption.

Operator

Our next question comes from Scott Stember with ROTH MKM.

Scott Stember
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

Clearly, some very nice progress here on the operational front. But just trying to get a sense of the price increases that you guys talked about on a select basis on RV. Just trying to get a sense of the size and the scale and basically to see if you've seen any pushback at retail at any point, just given those increases?

Michael Happe
CEO, President & Director

Scott, I think the word that we used was selective related to the price increases, and that is an important word. The market is not conducive or supportive of broad, significant price increases even with some of the cost input pressure that we're seeing from still ongoing tariffs for the time being. So our teams are really focusing their pricing around new products, around some of the feature enhancements we made in the latest model year transition.

Certainly, as we transform some of our brands, like particularly the Winnebago brand of RVs, we are actively pruning both the Motorized and Towable lines under the Winnebago brand by discontinuing some products that were not performing at retail and candidly, we're pressuring our margin and replacing those with healthier products, in some cases, even with probably an ASP lift as well. So the pricing is intentional, but it's also disciplined and selective. And we'll monitor the cost input environment, obviously, here as we go forward.

We have seen a few shifts in some commodities like aluminum lately as an example that we'll have to react to in the future if those trends continue. But to your point, we have to price to market and not necessarily to profit because we do want to maintain and, in fact, grow market share over time as well.

Scott Stember
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then just touching on the comment you made about what's in your control within guidance. I guess, given your commentary about where you expect 2Q to come in on the bottom line, obviously, the back half of the year is virtually everything. So just trying to get a sense of self-help items versus the market? Just trying to get a sense of how much will be based on what you have in your control?

Michael Happe
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Scott. Our business model, as you well know, is always back-half loaded from an EPS standpoint. Q1 and Q2 from our fiscal year timing are always softer from an EPS contribution standpoint. So the back half loading isn't abnormal from my standpoint, from a historical perspective. That being said, when I talk about controllables, I talk about several of the cost management and profit improvement initiatives we have underway here at the company in different parts of the business across supply chain. I talk about a lot of the new products that we're bringing out some of which the market doesn't know about yet, that we'll be bringing to some of the retail shows later in the spring for the first time.

We have brand extension going on, and we're candidly still seeing stock-ins on business revenue streams like Grand Design Motorized and Winnebago Towables. The new Class C Freedom Aire from Newmar has not hit the market yet in any material way. So the back half of the year is certainly a reflection of a market assumption that we've been transparent about.

But to your point, it's a collection of the commercial and the operational initiatives that we're driving. And so while we still have a relatively broad range on the guidance, I can -- I think you can take our moderate guidance increase this quarter to reflect our confidence in executing in Q1 well and looking at the following 3 quarters, Q2 and Q4 and saying, listen, most of those results are within our control.

Operator

Our next question comes from Tristan Thomas with BMO Capital Markets.

Tristan Thomas-Martin
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

You guys shift in the above retail during the quarter tied to new products. How should we think about that retail wholesale relationship in the rest of the year?

Michael Happe
CEO, President & Director

Well, we've been very clear that every business is expected to try to drive their trailing 12-month turns level in the field to around 2x. Now there's some seasonality related to that. There will be businesses that will be slightly above that at times, there will be businesses that are slightly below that. As an example, our Motorized RV businesses at times tend to run below 2x, particularly in the high-end Newmar type product.

But I would say we're really trying to stay disciplined. And with the exception of new products and some of these, let's call it, sort of brand reinvigoration efforts or new revenue streams like Grand Design Motorized, we're really trying to stay disciplined and keep dealer inventory in good shape.

If you look at our aging inventory, Tristan, year-over-year in macro on both the RV and Marine side, the percentage of aged inventory in our businesses is on a consolidated basis, less than it was a year ago. And so we not only feel good about the quantity of inventory in the business, but we are particularly pleased with the quality of the inventory at this time. The next 3, 4 months are going to be critical, obviously, to seeing what retail -- how that will shape up in the '26 selling season and how some of the current model of your inventory moves going forward.

Tristan Thomas-Martin
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. And this isn't necessarily a directly related follow-up. But just -- you mentioned a couple of times some of the operational margin improvement initiatives you've done. My understanding is a lot of that's on the Motorized side. So could you maybe just give an update on everything you've done and how much more there is to come and kind of what you're doing?

Michael Happe
CEO, President & Director

Yes. We probably used the word operational from a broad definition standpoint, but we have been more transparent about the operational initiatives, particularly around our Winnebago Motorhome business where we have been consolidating the footprint where we are undergoing rationalization of vertical discussions and even actions here at the company. We have been consolidating assembly lines across much of the RV portfolio candidly. There are lines that are not running today that we're running 2 years ago. But there are also lines and/or buildings in the company that are running multiple models today that weren't doing that a couple of years ago as well.

I also use the word operational when talking about supply chain efforts. As Bryan indicated, our tariff exposure for fiscal year '26 is embedded in the guidance that he provided. But there's a significant amount of work being done to obviously mitigate the tariff pressures. But also more importantly, we are really putting our foot on the pedal on what we'll call coordinated or centralized strategic sourcing initiatives to try to be smarter about how we buy working with our valued supply partners but also leveraging candidly some of the volume that we do have and even working on things like engineering efficiency to harmonize specs on key components across brands that allows us to buy a little smarter.

So over time, I think we'll probably figure out a way how to be more articulate about some of these operational initiatives and how they'll improve or contribute to improving gross margin in the future. But there's a lot of things going on across the whole of the portfolio.

Our next question comes from Mike Albanese with Benchmark StoneX.

Michael Albanese
The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division

Nice to see some momentum in the business here. Just quickly on Grand Design Motor, could you just comment on where you're tracking relative to your expectations as it relates to kind of that initial $100 million dealer stock?

Michael Happe
CEO, President & Director

Yes. We had mentioned in our fiscal '25 year that Grand Design Motorized would exceed $100 million in net revenue. And in fact, for the year that ended in August, we did reach that goal. The great news about the Grand Design Motorized strategy is that it's multiyear in its formation. We have a -- candidly, a 3- to 5-year plan on making Grand Design Motorized one of the most exciting brands in the Motorized segment. We've already reached more than 4 points of market share, 15 months into this journey. And many of the products that are on the wish list at Grand Design from a Motorized perspective have not seen the light of day yet in the market.

So we are really pleased with the products that have been released even some things that, candidly, I personally wasn't sure how the market would react to like the Series F lineage Super C, that's been fantastic. The market has reacted very strongly. And as you all know, the Super C category has been one of those sort of hot trendy categories in Motorized RVs in the last several years.

So we're on track, if not ahead of our plan. We just gave our Board an update on this here recently as well. So we anticipate fiscal '26 to benefit, but from the continued progression, not just at wholesale, but in the market and with our dealer relationships, from the retail success that we're beginning to see across their lines. So very excited about that particular business initiative.

Bryan Hughes
SVP of Investor Relations, Finance, Information Technology and Business Development & CFO

Yes. And the Series M -- for the Grand Design Motorhome, Series M is already #2, #3 in its class for retail share. So just a phenomenal entry point by that particular model and floor plan. And then similarly, as Mike was just talking about the Class F, Super C has already achieved a top 3 rating as well in retail. So the 2 models that they've come forward with have both hit the market extremely well, both from a retail and wholesale perspective.

Michael Albanese
The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division

That's great context. Just a quick follow-up, that initial stock, if you will, for some of these new models. I mean, how would you frame the opportunity size relative to the original linage that came out? I'm just trying to think about growth here as new models are implemented.

Michael Happe
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Michael, we're not sharing a specific target number for Grand Design Motorized for fiscal '26 as it becomes a more meaningful part of the portfolio. We tend to obviously share disclosure by segment. But you can expect it to grow. We won't provide a sales target this morning. Some of the back half wholesale volume will certainly be dependent on retail replenishment of current models in the field in addition to any new products that you'll see Grand Design Motorized bring to the market as well.

Michael Albanese
The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division

Fair enough. And then just another quick one, if I may. I just want to follow up on mix shift. Obviously, you have some selective price increases. You come out with new models across the board to kind of meet consumers where they're at from an affordability standpoint. Just taking a step back here and thinking about the overall mix shift from the consumer, they've obviously, over the last couple of years, have gravitated towards those value products. I mean, are we still moving in that direction? Or has that kind of stabilized? And again, that's a little more industry-specific than company-specific because you have some initiatives that are obviously affecting mix shift within your portfolio but...

Michael Happe
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I don't think the consumer has stabilized quite yet from an affordability perspective. I mean, as you guys are well aware, there's a lot of chatter in the financial media and many industries about consumer affordability, particularly of discretionary higher-priced items. I'll tell you this, we're kind of playing the game at both ends. We have absolutely improved our lower price point products almost in every brand that we carry. And so while we sometimes don't get that first-time buyer, we have a better chance through some of the products that we've introduced here recently with Access in the Winnebago Towables line, Transcend One in the Grand Design line. The Aria from Barletta continues to do fantastic.

But when I say we're playing both ends, we're also introducing products with higher price points that are being successful as well. The Super C products from Newmar and Grand Design are a good example of that. Some of Barletta's best-performing brands continue to be in the higher side of their line, the Lusso which -- I own a Lusso myself, that continues to be a really strong performer in the in the Barletta line, and that's probably their -- one of their top 2 or 3 brands in the whole catalog.

And so we're going to try to have a broad full lineup within better-best within our segments and not only attract more affordable consumers, but those consumers who also have a little higher level of discernment and will trade up buy up and expect the best as well. So we don't talk a lot about retail dollar share on the call, candidly, because we don't have the greatest data here in Winnebago Industries. But I'm really confident that if you look at the combination of our unit retail volume and our ASP trends versus the rest of the market, that we're actually gaining retail market share in both the RV and Marine industry. And I think that's just as important as unit volume. You take dollars to the bank, and those retail dollars ultimately are really, really valuable to us.

Bryan Hughes
SVP of Investor Relations, Finance, Information Technology and Business Development & CFO

The only other thing I'd add as it relates to mix is that we welcome the more recent strength in both retail and wholesale growth in the Motorhome business. As I think everyone on the call understands Motorhome for a long time had been seeing declines. And more recently, we're finally starting to see that show year-over-year improvement. So we welcome that trend as well, particularly as it relates to our portfolio business.

Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.

Bret Jordan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Pretty much everything has been asked. But I guess one macro question. When you think about your forecast for '26, what is the assumption on sort of a rate backdrop? And what kind of Fed move would make you either more positive or negative on that outlook?

Bryan Hughes
SVP of Investor Relations, Finance, Information Technology and Business Development & CFO

Yes. Bret, this is Bryan. We hesitate to draw too much correlation to Fed action. We are anticipating from a macro perspective, another 2 to 3 25-point cuts over the next year. I think that that's the prevailing expectation and how the bond market is priced out right now. What happens to the 10-year, as I think you know, Bret, is probably more important for our industry as it relates to floor plan financing costs as well as retail financing. So we'll keep a close eye on that.

There's different points of view, I think, as to what will happen with the 10-year rate as it relates to the correlation between that and the Fed funds rate. But that's kind of how we're thinking about it right now.

Operator

Our next question comes from Noah Zatzkin with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Noah Zatzkin
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I guess first, just on the margin recapture initiatives at Winnebago Motorhomes. You touched on this a bit, but any way to like quantify kind of the magnitude of those initiatives on the improvement in Motorized margins in the quarter? And then just kind of thinking through like where you are maybe like in terms of innings or opportunity that's kind of left from a margin perspective structurally moving forward? Any thoughts would be helpful.

Michael Happe
CEO, President & Director

Noah, thanks for the questions. Let me comment first on the Winnebago Motorhome side and then Bryan, obviously can give you some further perspectives on margin, trends and opportunities for the business. I'll be very transparent that the Winnebago Motorhome margin improvement contribution to Q1 was not as significant as some of the other Motorized contributors in that segment which means from a positive standpoint that the contributions of a stronger Winnebago Motorhome business are still ahead of us, not just in fiscal '26 but fiscal '27. That particular business is obviously our flagship legacy business.

We're very busy there under Chris West leadership and his team to improve that business. But I would not tell you that the financial benefits of that business are being quite felt yet within the Q1 financials. But the expectation is that those do grow sequentially in the future. So we're not providing specific dollar references there, but that journey should become a bigger contributor in the future.

Bryan Hughes
SVP of Investor Relations, Finance, Information Technology and Business Development & CFO

Yes. I guess what I'd add on that one, Noah, is we gave guidance that the Motorhome segment would reach OI yield in the low single digits. We stand by that guidance. That compares to a negative 0.6% so slightly negative OI yield in '25. So that continues to be our target. Hey, I think we saw a good proof point in Q1, some good improvement there, a lot of the improvements longer term, including the back half of this fiscal year are tied to the product and the new introductions, the refreshes that the team is working very hard on, and as Mike alluded to, some of those are yet to really impact the yield. So we look for continued improvement there long term, but we like what we saw in Q1 here as it relates to an initial proof point.

Noah Zatzkin
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

That's really helpful. And maybe just one more. Thinking about this from an industry perspective, I think Motorized shipments have been kind of stronger at least year-over-year overall for the industry of late. When you think about kind of inventory levels there for the industry as well as drivers of that, is that more that, that levels kind of got lower than ideal? Or what's kind of driven that pop? I know for you guys, part of that obviously is the new product, but more broadly?

Michael Happe
CEO, President & Director

Well, I think the trends, Noah, within that segment vary by class. And so the Class A consumer has been soft for really a few years now. Recently, we've seen the Class B van category, not have the same vigor that it used to have in prior years. The segment -- the 2 segments that have been very strong, have been Class C -- traditional Class Cs both Diesel and Gas but also Super Cs. And so that's where you've seen a lot of dealers, I believe, shift their recent inventory management practices to making sure that they have the products that they want to have in the Class C space.

We're watching that Class C category carefully. It's pretty crowded. There's a lot of competition. And I would say the turns in that Class C category probably need to be a little bit higher in the future. And hopefully, we'll see some retail momentum in calendar '26 to help the whole industry get the inventory in that particular segment, maybe even in a little bit better shape. But I don't think we're overly concerned. The dealers are putting their bets there. And obviously, the OEMs are working closely with them. I don't know, Bryan, if you...

Bryan Hughes
SVP of Investor Relations, Finance, Information Technology and Business Development & CFO

Just one small add. We feel really good about our dealer inventory position. We saw a pretty sizable decline year-over-year, 19% in inventories out in the field. And that is even with the launch of the Grand Design Motorhome and the stocking up in the field of that business, the Series M and S. So we feel really good about our position there, and I think that, that will serve us well throughout fiscal '26.

Our next question comes from John Healy with Northcoast Research.

John Healy
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

I wanted to ask one about the kind of the margin outlook in the business and how it ties into environment we're in. Mike, I know you've mentioned numerous times on the call that you guys are working on sourcing, working with your suppliers, you're doing all the things that we would expect it to. But I was curious if there's been any development in terms of tying cost and input costs to the actual tariff environment? Have you been able to develop any sort of linkage?

So theoretically, if we do get some relief on tariffs and maybe certain ones kind of go to the wayside in calendar '26, is there any sort of kind of automatic kind of indexed type relief that you would get? Or is this going to be a situation where you have to go back and try to price some dollars out of things?

And hypothetically, is there a view with your suppliers that, hey, we need to maybe share more of this or work with more of this than there was 6 months ago just to impact and solve this affordability issue? Because when I listened to calls of your industry, everyone talks about affordability and interest rates, but it seems like there could be more give back with the suppliers and the sourcing community. So I was hoping to hear your thoughts on that.

Michael Happe
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, John, for the question. So multiple dimensions to what you talked about, let me try to break it down efficiently here. We have a very robust tariff exposure risk management process in the company. It extends from our centralized strategic sourcing function as the air traffic control tower on that to deep within the businesses in terms of their day-to-day relationships with suppliers. I think we feel good that there's a high level of transparency by our Tier 1 suppliers as to the tariff pressures that they have been experiencing. They're not always the importer of record. They have either Tier 2 or Tier 3 supply relationships that pass those costs up to them. And in many cases, our suppliers have agreed to defer and/or share the increased tariff costs that we've seen since April of 2025.

But that's on a case-by-case basis. And it's one of those cases where if you don't ask, you may not get that as an initial response, but our supply chain partnerships have been good there. We've also done a lot of other things in terms of engineering design, build material management, working through some of our own raw materials and component inventory to try to be creative and mitigate that. And so while that's been a Herculean exercise, for really the last 8, 9 months, we feel good about managing the exposure. And as I said earlier, the Bryan's guidance here this morning embeds that into our earnings outlook for fiscal '26.

Now overall, should the Supreme Court make the decision that the IEEPA tariff powers are no longer and there is some sort of refund process, we'll have to digest that very quickly and obviously work with our supply chain to see what that means from a possible recovery standpoint going forward. Just in general, though, we are maturing in our muscle building on just, again, as I said earlier, trying to manage our material costs within the company.

And there -- each of our businesses and brands has a significant target for fiscal '26 to secure some savings. And that doesn't always necessarily mean that's a bad thing for our supply chain. That just may mean that we're going about our purchasing just a little bit differently as well. And there could be some consolidation of how many suppliers will use on a certain part.

So all of that is kind of baked into this, I think, 40% plus increase in EPS year-over-year. It's one of the "controllables" that we believe that we can execute in the year. But tariffs continue to be very top of mind and we'll manage those for as long as that pressure is upon us. But you're absolutely right that any input pressure cost-wise in this industry is nonconstructive versus dealing with consumer affordability right now. We all need to try to find a way to make the products more affordable ultimately.

Joan Ondala

One last question, operator.

Operator

And as we have time for one last question, our final question comes from David Whiston with Morningstar.

David Whiston
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Just one question for me. It's on the success drivers slide. You talked about Newmar having competitive in some lower-priced segments. Are we talking just a new product there? Or are you actually talking about the price reductions because that's a luxury brand, you don't have a lot of leeway to cut pricing there?

Michael Happe
CEO, President & Director

Yes, David, good to hear from you. It's really about new products in the Newmar business. Not price reductions. I would tell you that Casey Tubman, who leads that business, has been very disciplined with again, managing their floor plan and their model mix to make sure that we have the right floor plans that are moving in the market. So you may see a little ASP shift because of that.

Newmar is one of our most coveted brand assets. Just a tremendous consumer experience, great dealer partnerships and the product is second to none in the marketplace. So everything we do at Newmar is about, I think, maintaining that brand promise that is luxury that is second to none. So when we talk about affordability there, it's really coming up with new products that maybe fill out the little lower side of that luxury lineup on the pricing side.

So the Freedom Air in the Class C space is premium versus the other Class Cs in the market but it is affordable for people to get into the Newmar brand in a whole different way. So it depends on how you kind of define affordability. But a lot of people want to get into that brand and we're trying to provide a catalog there that gives them access across multiple segments. But no, we're going to -- we're not looking to raise price dramatically on that brand by any means, but we're certainly we're certainly trying to keep that consumer experience just best-in-class.
