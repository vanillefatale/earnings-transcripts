Question-and-Answer Session

Thanks for that, Peter. So I think I just want to start with the quarter that you just talked about. You already talked about it in the presentation, but put up a really good performance, $64 million to $65 million in the quarter, give or take. And the U.S. really kind of hitting the growth from third quarter to fourth quarter that I think we were really hoping to look at. But I guess just like taking it from a high level at first, when we think about the health of the underlying market, obviously, you were able to drive the growth that you're looking for in the U.S. market. You've talked about how there's market trends between GLP-1s, between social media that are continuing to support your growth. But how do you think about the overall health of the broader market when it comes to consumer spending and the durability of that into 2026?

Filippo Caldini
CEO & Director

Yes. I mean I think when you look at it on a global basis, specific to breast implants, I mean, we've seen it's a relatively stable market in most of the geographies in which we compete. So for us, with that stability and as we keep on driving share growth through our minimally invasive platform as well as what we're doing in the U.S. in terms of expanding our sales force, the smaller sizes, I think we really have an opportunity to continue to drive growth. And we don't see any issues or concerns regarding the macroeconomic environment as it relates to its impact on implants.

I guess internationally, so you didn't break it out, but clearly, based on the performance internationally as a whole, you did in line to better than expected. you break out your international markets into 3 segments. So when we think about performances across Latin America, APAC, EMEA, there's been some market challenges there. You've been able to stabilize in some of your direct markets in third quarter. But have we seen that strength in direct markets continue into fourth quarter? What was distributor demand like? And if you could talk about just dynamics between the 3 different geographies.

Filippo Caldini
CEO & Director

Yes. So I'll talk about the direct and the distributor markets. I mean that was a strategic choice by us, Allen, to kind of really drive growth in the direct markets. These are markets we have much better economics. The price point is actually double than what we have in the distributor market. And quite frankly, we're probably a little bit too dependent on the distributor marketplace. So that was still in Q4, a key driver for our performance OUS. And over time, the plan is to continue to drive growth in those markets and really reduce our dependency on the distributor business. And in terms of the geographical breakout.

Rajbir Denhoy
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I'd say, Allen, it's kind of in keeping with what we've seen over the balance of this year. As Peter noted, direct markets continue to drive the business for us. And if you think about within our segments, in Europe, we are split between distributors and direct. That market continues to do very well, again, driven by the health in the direct markets. Latin America is a bit of a mix as well. We're direct in Brazil and Argentina. We're seeing very good results in Argentina and our distributor markets there. Brazil has been a little challenging. We've talked about it, but we have seen stability in that market for the last several quarters. And then Asia Pacific is the one that is 100% distributor, right? And while we're seeing very good underlying trends in that business, there's always going to be that timing of orders, right? And so I'd say, overall, as Peter noted, the demand for our products globally remains very good, and we're seeing it across all the geographies.

K. Gong
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then that 25% minimum of 25% in 2026, 2027, if I look at where consensus is today, they're right at the mid-20s or 2026. So it sounds like that's the floor to next year. What needs to -- at least implies that you see a path to upside. So what is the base case that gets you to 25%? And what needs to happen for you to outperform that?

Rajbir Denhoy
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I think if you again think about 27% growth we posted in 2025, right? So we're coming off a very strong year. We have a lot of momentum heading into 2026. what we need in order to make those numbers is just continue to execute. We haven't assumed any new product approvals. We haven't assumed reconstruction revenue in the United States in those numbers. So it's really a continuation of what we're currently doing. And so far, as I noted, we haven't picked up any change in the marketplace. The demand remains very good and what we're seeing in terms of the orders even here in early 2026 remains very good.

K. Gong
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

The U.S. is definitely one of the major parts of the growth story going forward. You have tailwinds there next year between Preservé, which is going to start launching or maybe has already started launching in the first quarter of this year and also just additional sizes, reconstruction, the reconstruction might be more 2027. So I guess starting on the augmentation side and especially with Preservé, how much of a growth uplift do you think Preservé can really add? And what is your approach to the launch this year, given it might be something a little bit more familiar for physicians at least compared to, say, like Mia? And how quickly can you really roll that out? And should we think of that as being potentially a workhorse, especially in the U.S. where your ASP compared to the rest of the world is already a little bit higher?

Filippo Caldini
CEO & Director

Yes. I mean I think the Preservé launch is going to be a key driver for us, as I mentioned, not only to drive market share, but it's also -- there's a lot of indication that has the potential to expand the category. We're hearing that from the surgeons. And our rollout plan is really going to be focused on making sure we get the right education for the surgeons. So we expect that once we get that started, that it's going to really turn into a flywheel, and it's going to accelerate through the course of the year. But we expect a significant growth in 2026 on our Preservé launch, but also the things that we're doing on our base augmentation when you're adding the additional sales reps, we've already got, as you highlighted, over 1,500 accounts. As we work through that utilization, the adoption curve, that's also going to continue to increase. So I think you're going to see it on both ends, the traditional augmentation as well as on the Preservé.

K. Gong
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So diving a little bit deeper into that 1,500-plus number. I think in the past, you've talked about how when we look at -- when we focus on the higher volume customer base, there's only like a couple of thousand that really do the majority of procedures in the U.S. So when I think about 1,500, obviously, not every single one of those is going to be one of those high-volume surgeons, but you've clearly done a very good job of going broad and really making sure that you're getting into a lot of accounts -- so when I think about the growth outlook for 2026, how much of that is from going deeper into existing accounts? How much of that is going broader? Should we think about -- maybe a lot of those are the higher volume accounts, I would imagine, and now you're going to be adding on relatively smaller accounts. So just talk about that.

Filippo Caldini
CEO & Director

Yes. So in the U.S., I think, obviously, we're going to continue to expand the number of accounts. We add accounts every day. I think Jeff today had 2 additional -- 3 additional accounts. So that's also going to continue to be a part of that growth process for us. But it's also -- I think we're going to be going deeper in increasing the utilization rate as the surgeons work through their adoption curve, I think you're going to see a lot more acceleration from that standpoint in terms of enhancing the utilization in those accounts.

K. Gong
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And then I guess I do want to touch on the competitive landscape, right? You had Sientra, like they haven't exactly exited the market, but they've definitely maybe been deemphasizing that piece of their business. You have the large players, J&J and Alcon, but arguably, breast augmentation also isn't a big focus for them. But clearly, you've come into the market and really taken it by storm, getting to 20% share within essentially a year is a very big success. So are you seeing anything on the competitive front? Any kind of reaction?

Filippo Caldini
CEO & Director

No, I think you see a lot of one-offs. I wouldn't say there's a real concerted effort by either of those players. And I think while they're sizable businesses, when we look at it, within the portfolio of those companies, it's actually very small. And these are not categories that are very prioritized for the J&Js and the AbbVies of the world. So we haven't seen a significant competitive response. And quite frankly, I'm not sure that's surprising. These are not businesses that are priorities, and that's really enabled us to get significant traction in the U.S.

K. Gong
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Then on the reconstruction side, you just submitted that in the U.S. in December. Your presentation has more of a 2027 benefit, but as it has the opportunity to potentially double your addressable opportunity in the U.S., definitely worth talking about. When we think about why the U.S. is a better market for that, you have better reimbursement in place. So when we think about the competitive positioning there, clearly, you're having success on the augmentation side. But is that same kind of -- I don't want to maybe call it hands off, but a little bit of a looser approach from your competitors, the same thing we can expect in reconstruction once you start launching there?

Filippo Caldini
CEO & Director

Yes. I think, first off, once we get the indication approval, I think we are going to get the same type of traction in the Recon indication that we've gotten in the augmentation. I think we -- by having that superior product, we already have establishment and with our Flora tissue expander in those accounts. So I would expect that, that acceleration actually be somewhat quicker than what we've seen from the augmentation where we're really starting at 0. So I think in terms of the competitive response, I don't think it's going to be any different, Allen. In those -- in the Recon indication, as I mentioned before, the fundamental issue is these are not categories that they prioritize.

K. Gong
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I guess touching on more product specific. Preservé launching into the U.S. now. You've been doing -- you've been having more of an early experience internationally. It sounds like that early experience has been going well. The feedback has been good. And I just want to kind of compare and contrast that with Mia, right? In the presentation, you framed Mia as being definitely more of a premium product, but Preservé is also, especially compared to your Ergonomix1, it is also a premium product. So when I think about having your entire -- the breadth of your portfolio now with Preservé and Mia at the top, how are those kind of like working together in the portfolio?

Filippo Caldini
CEO & Director

Yes. So I mean, the first thing, when you look at the U.S. right now, it's just going to be Preservé. We are going to be submitting the PMA supplement really the beginning of this year. So I think in order to launch Mia, you need to have the ERGO 2, the ERGO 2 diamond. So I think that's more in the outer years. But outside the U.S., I think they've worked very complementary. With Mia, it's a more premium segment. There are some limitations in terms of the cup size and the type of surgeons that are willing to use it. So in a lot of cases, with the transactionary approach and the fact that the MA does not have any scar on the breast is a significant benefit, but it's much more in the premium segment. And what we've seen outside the U.S. is actually the Mia accounts are also adopting Preservé, and you're seeing hand-in-hand significant growth for both businesses. So it hasn't really cannibalized the business in the early stages. So we're very pleased with that. But they work very well together, especially when you have that segmentation and there are specific benefits for MA that you will not get from Preservé.

K. Gong
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And then I guess, diving a little bit deeper into international markets. Latin America, I think it's been struggling for a while now. We started to see stabilization this year, but not exactly a recovery. So did that continue into fourth quarter of stabilization, but maybe not really recovery? And then what's the right expectation for 2026?

Rajbir Denhoy
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I think without breaking out the fourth quarter, we haven't provided that detail yet, we'll do so on our fourth quarter call. But as you noted, we have seen a generally good performance out of Latin America with the exception of Brazil, which has been a little challenging for us. But as I noted, it's been stable now for a couple of quarters, really the back half of last year. It's really stabilized. And as we move into 2026, we do have some programs to hopefully accelerate growth there. Preservé has launched in Brazil. We're seeing good demand for the product in that market. And so we do have expectations that we'll see some growth out of Brazil. Latin America as a whole, outside of that market has generally been pretty good for us. Mexico, Colombia, these are some of our biggest markets and there the demand remains very good. So I think overall, Latin America, we have good expectations for '26.

K. Gong
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And then on the APAC side, right, it's a little bit interesting there because Japan and South Korea are undoubtedly success stories for ESTA where you have maybe a majority share, correct me if I'm wrong, at least a very significant share in both of those markets, and you got there relatively quickly. So I guess starting there, and I do want to talk on China after, you've already reached a really healthy share position in those markets. So how do you continue to drive growth there? You have mix upgrades, I imagine, but how do you grow the market further?

Filippo Caldini
CEO & Director

Yes. I think in 2026, the back half of 2026 as well as into 2027, we're going to be launching Preservé in those markets. That has, as I mentioned before, an opportunity not only to drive incremental share, but as you made the point, we already have sizable share. There is the opportunity to expand the market. So that's going to be a key driver in those markets and continue to drive that innovation. There's still opportunities for us to grow through our distributors. And I think we're very fortunate in the success we've had in those markets. But I think when you overlay that type of innovation with Preservé, it has the opportunity to steal additional share, but also expand the category.

K. Gong
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

On the other side, you have China, which in terms of pure market size, I think we were really bullish at the start. It was going to be the second largest market after the U.S. Unfortunately, the launch hasn't really had the traction that I think we really would have wanted in the bull case. You invested a bit more money into that business into your distributor specifically. So have you seen any of those efforts bearing fruit? And I guess just help us to understand why isn't the market doing quite as well, both maybe specifically for you and also just for breast augmentation as a whole?

Filippo Caldini
CEO & Director

Yes. I think -- I mean, there's -- certainly, I think it's pretty well known some of the macroeconomic issues in China that's really impacted our category. So I think that's kind of suppressed the market opportunity certainly in the short term. In terms of our distributor, I think we've communicated that we were not as happy with their commercial development. We've seen a lot of progress over the last couple of quarters in terms of the increase in sellout. And our engagement has really been around to optimize a lot of their strategy, pricing points and things like that. In terms of creating awareness, I would say that distributor has done a very good job in that market. It's really about them building out their capabilities. It's a large market. But we fully expect that China will have in a year or 2 to have the same type of share that we see in other markets throughout Asia.

K. Gong
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. That would be really great. So I guess like when I think about the 25% plus, that assumes in 2026, 2027, that assumes that China picks up?

Filippo Caldini
CEO & Director

Yes. So we have -- the expectation is this year, we'll have some sales in China. And then as the market progresses and our distributor progresses, we expect that to grow in 2027 and beyond.

K. Gong
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And then shifting over to the financials with the time we have left. I think one of the big benefits, again, of having the U.S. launch performing really well is that it is a higher-margin opportunity for you. You were able to get adjusted EBITDA profitability a little bit sooner than I think you were expecting. You're still on track for free cash flow positive next year. So how do you balance investing, adding another 15 sales reps in the U.S., maybe putting a little bit more effort into China as well to really get that jump started against continuing to drive leverage and maintaining cash flow discipline.

Rajbir Denhoy
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I think as Peter noted in the presentation, the infrastructure for our company has largely been built for the last 20 years, right? So you think about the various support structures you need, finance, legal, HR, all of those functions are in place. And the incremental spending for us from this point is really around commercial, right? So adding salespeople, adding support for those people, additional shipping costs, but these expenses will grow at a rate significantly lower than what the top line will for the next couple of years. And that's where this leverage really starts to flow through. We're talking about operating expenses, but you're also seeing it to a great degree on what's happening on the gross profitability line. We were in the mid-60s, 1.5 years, 2 years ago. Now we've pressed it above 70%. The U.S., recon, direct markets, all of these initiatives that are driving our growth are all at a higher gross profit margin than we have historically seen as our company. So you're seeing the gross profit increase dramatically, and then we're able to really control the amount of incremental spending we need to support the growth. And that leverage will start to become very apparent as you move through 2026 into 2027, and that's what ultimately drives us to this cash flow breakeven that we expect to achieve at some point this year.

K. Gong
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So as an extension to that, you clearly -- you're adding more reps in the U.S. just to support the augmentation launch, but then next year, you have reconstruction. The year after that or in 2027, you might be moving into glut as well. So when I think about the need to potentially expand your sales force to address those targets, do you think you can do that with like these additional 15 on top of the 40 or so you have today? Or will there be additional rep adds needed?

Rajbir Denhoy
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I think, again, it is -- we will continue to invest in commercial and primarily again to support the United States, as you described. But the incremental investment is around adding sales reps and the people needed to support them. So if we have 40-ish sales reps now, we'll add another 15 this year to support continued growth through '26. We'll see another incremental step-up in '27 to support recon. But if you think about the revenue potential that, that drives, given the size of the markets and the profitability of the markets in the United States, it's spending that -- it's going to -- the contribution margin from those sales over the next couple of years is going to be very significant.

K. Gong
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Unfortunately, that's all the time we have left. Thank you so much for the time today.

Rajbir Denhoy
Chief Financial Officer

Great. Thank you.

Filippo Caldini
CEO & Director

Thank you.
