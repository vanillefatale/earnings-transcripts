[Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.

George Staphos
BofA Securities, Research Division

My question in your free cash flow guidance of $300 million to $500 million, can you give us some of the other important assumptions that are in there? I don't believe price is in there, but if you could confirm that related -- is -- are you out with a price letter to customers? And then most importantly in terms of the question, if you want to just take this, $300 million, $500 million doesn't cover your dividend, Andy, with the spin. Might you consider reviewing the dividend policy over time?

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

So first, yes, we are out with a price letter. We have done that earlier this week. And so that will play itself out in the normal course of business. As you noted, no, there is no inclusion of price in the numbers that we have provided today into the guidance that we have -- provided an incremental price to come through. And as Lance said, in there, each $10 of price that sticks is worth about $90 million of price realization into the market. So that -- I think that covers that question there. Lance can cover any other topics you want to talk on about other elements of free cash flow.

What was the second part of the question, George?

Lance Loeffler
Senior VP & CFO

It's on the dividend.

George Staphos
BofA Securities, Research Division

The dividend, $1 billion and the free cash flow, $300 million, $500 million, might the spin be an opportunity to review the policy and how do you feel about it?

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Yes, sure. So we've said all along that covering the dividend was about $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion of EBITDA is the breakeven. Obviously, in 2026, we have substantial restructuring costs that are going in and some onetime costs that don't fit into the restructuring line. So you've got a combination of those things. We are maintaining our dividend policy as it is through 2026. And of course, through any process like this, you're going to review that work in conjunction with shareholders to make sure we get to the right place on a dividend post spin, and we'll evaluate that throughout the year in conversation with the shareholders.

Our next question is going to come from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research Partners.

Mark Weintraub
Seaport Research Partners

A few really straightforward questions. One is -- so on some of the slides, it says like at the segment level, it doesn't exclude -- that it's excluding corporate. And then on the final slide, it doesn't sort of say anything about that. So just one clarification. How should we be thinking about corporate relative to the various numbers you're putting out there, that $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, is that included or not included?

Lance Loeffler
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So the guide that Andy gave on a total company basis, $740 million to $760 million includes the impact of corporate. So if you take what we gave you on the region slides and the difference between that should cover the corporate line item.

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Yes. Same thing for the year, Mark.

Mark Weintraub
Seaport Research Partners

Okay. And with the spin, is there any meaningful change to what you expect corporate costs would go to?

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Well, they would go to their independent regions. But in terms of being an overall increase, no, there would not be.

Mark Weintraub
Seaport Research Partners

Okay. Very good. And then second, any quick reason why -- and maybe this is normal of course, but why 12 to 15 months to complete this process? It seems like a long time to me, but maybe I'm just wrong.

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Yes. I'll touch on that. There's -- you get the mechanics, frankly, of accounting, right? There's just -- it's a heavy lift from an accounting perspective. What we don't have here is kind of large legal entity issues or things like that. And obviously, we're going to move to do it as quickly as possible, Mark, but the best guidance that we've been giving in the precedent is usually somewhere in that 12- to 15-month time frame.

Lance, anything you'd add to that?

Lance Loeffler
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. No. I would say -- I would echo Andy's comments. I think this is a little different than if you look back at the Sylvamo exercise we went through several years ago that had a lot more operational tethering that we had to unwind to get that to where it needed to be. This is largely an accounting exercise that we're going to start off today in real haste to try to get this thing done by the end of the year. But right now, we're contemplating 12 to 15 months.

Mark Weintraub
Seaport Research Partners

And one last one and hopefully not an unfair one, but so you've got this big step up in the second half of next year, particularly in North America, and you lay it out very clearly. It does include a big cost takeout acceleration, that $200 million. And if we look back, you had a great first quarter relative to expectations, et cetera. And then the last three quarters, though, you fall in shy on ops and costs. And so maybe talk a little bit about why you have a lot of confidence that you get back on track and you can deliver a really big number second half of 2026.

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Yes, a few things in there, Mark. So first and foremost, the vast majority of what we're talking about are things that have been actioned and the tail here are the cost of finalizing that. So as an example, closures and the lingering cost of finalizing those closures, those tails start to fall off as we get through this year. That's a big one.

Second, we've got more actions. They're not the large-scale actions that we've seen so far, but we're starting to get much more into the nitty-gritty around things like supply chain and procurement distribution rolling out the Lighthouse models throughout the mill system and the productivity investments that we're ramping up going into that. And so there's a lot of intensity to happen last year and certainly throughout this year, that's going to continue to drive those. So those benefits start to accumulate more and more as time goes on through there.

So the key to it is it's literally -- the costs have got to be counted down to the penny in terms of facilities, impact of people, which is always unfortunate, but a tough reality in the transformation. And that's the level of granularity we're operating at. And that's both in North America and you saw for the first time today that we were able to -- now that we've gotten past a bunch of the consultation periods, to lay out the granularity in Europe, and you can see the magnitude of what we're doing in Europe that we will accelerate throughout the year.

So this is extremely granular. Look, I'm also realistic. There's a lot of moving parts. There's no doubt about it, but we are executing quite well.

Your next question comes from the line of Charlie Muir-Sands with BNP Paribas.

Charlie Muir-Sands
BNP Paribas, Research Division

Just firstly, if I could just ask on volumes. You alluded to your belief that you gained share in the second half of the year in North America. It seems likely albeit we haven't seen the industry data yet. Can you just talk about the relative profitability you're seeing on those new wins versus the old business you lost. And also, I think you suggested there's something similar in EMEA. I wondered if you could share any kind of like-for-like or pro forma volume performance you've achieved in that region.

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Charlie, I apologize, you were pretty muffled on that call, so I'm going to do my best where I think I heard the question, which is really around the volume wins and the quality of profitability around those volume wins, if I understood it right.

Charlie Muir-Sands
BNP Paribas, Research Division

Right.

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Yes. So they're very good. As you recall back a couple of years ago, we really started to reset our discipline around assuring that we were pricing to market, and we've obviously kept that discipline and if you look at the volume wins we've had in North America, they have been absolutely at those quality levels that we've been talking about. And so I feel really good about the business that we're winning and coming on. Again, we won substantial market share here in North America in the back half of the year. We were 3 or 4 points above market. We'll find out where the market actually settled later on here, but we feel very confident given the other results that we've seen that we have one quality market share, and you can see the expanding margins at the same time.

In Europe, right, the market has been softer in Europe. And just like in the U.S., you have to play where the market is. We have been really disciplined about making sure that we are bringing our value to the market, and we're not chasing bad business. That's very important in a softer market, and we have not been doing that. And again, you can count it by meters or you can count it by tons, we can see where those wins have come in and then how they'll be layered into the year. So we feel good about the wins that we have. We feel good about the commercial momentum in both regions, particularly in North America, where we won substantial market share, and our work is to keep that momentum continuing.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies.

Philip Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Thanks for all the great color. A lot to unpack. I guess, to kind of kick things off, the 2026 guidance. Lance, last quarter, you guys gave us a nice slide deck calling out $600 million of self-help and commercial efforts. Certainly, there's -- it feels like there's some movement, but the guide itself, does it account for any incremental cost actions that has yet to be announced? So -- or is that kind of accounted for?

Second, I think on the commercial front, certainly better in North America and Europe. And correct me if I'm wrong, Lance, the North America piece accounts for the exports, you kind of co-mingled it. So where are you seeing some of the wins on the commercial side, whether it's North America and Europe? I mean, Europe, I'm particularly curious, just give -- I thought the commercial side of things were quite good but it was more on the cost out. So help us kind of see through some of those dynamics.

Lance Loeffler
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So I'll start with the cost-out side. Yes. So what we described, I think, infamously, it was like Slide 15 on the deck on the third quarter call where we talked about a lot of the momentum that we had in carrying over things that had already been announced in 2025 and what that impact would be. I think that was the $500 million that you were characterizing. We are going to continue to optimize in North America around our 80/20 transformation. So it's an incremental $200 million of cost benefit that should be accruing to us as we continue to execute that plan as we look to -- into second half of '26 and into 2027.

On the commercial side, we're really pleased with the amount of progress that we've made about. We're ahead of schedule. I think as Andy mentioned, in terms of North America and our exit this year in the fourth quarter. And we thought we'd be at market. We're clearly ahead of that and we're excited about onboarding some very important customers that allow us to achieve those metrics. And we're excited about the wins that we've got in Europe. We expect to outperform. We believe the market next year will be up 1.7%, I believe, next year and -- or excuse me, in 2026 and we believe will outperform by about 50 basis points ahead of that. So we're excited about the momentum that we've got in that market as well.

Philip Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Got it. So just so if I heard you correctly, Lance, the upside on the cost out, the $200 million that's incremental cost actions you haven't taken in the back half of '26 that you still need to execute...

Lance Loeffler
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So Phil, those will be -- those are -- that amount and those actions are stuff that was not announced or actioned in 2025 that we will continue in terms of our momentum into 2026.

Philip Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And the other piece I wanted to tease out, perhaps for you, Andy. Mark kind of teased it out already last year, a nice beat in the first quarter and the Q2 to Q4 was a little uneven. Just want to give us some comfort that the framework you've laid out accounts for any hiccups along the way just because it's a choppy environment. So like how you kind of laid out the framework where -- is this conservative or are you making like a lot of stuff kind of has to kind of stick the landing just because you got a lot of moving pieces here.

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Yes. I think the range that we've given provides a pretty decent margin in there in terms of the $740 million to $760 million in the quarter and the $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion in the year.

In terms of kind of -- I would just call them good guys, bad guys, how do you think about that over the year. On the good guy side, the year has started strong, and I will certainly say that January was strong. Obviously, the ice storm, that's going to be on the bad guy side, to see kind of what that impact is going to be. It's a super thumbnail sketch of $20 million to $25 million. It's just hard to know, right? You could make that up. But certainly, mill shutdowns and certainly some of the areas that were hit hard in terms of box. The box side will come back fast, but you got some mill impact that we'll see how that plays out because that's a pretty modest bad guy that's out there. Again, the January has started strong. We've seen that in our daily numbers. We'd expect that to even off throughout the year. And again, we said we thought the North American market would be flat to up 1%, and we'll take a couple of points of market share in there.

In terms of other good guys, right, we don't have anything in here for price. And we don't normally do that. We don't normally guide that. And so we've kept to that practice. But depending upon what happens with pricing, that's a pretty substantial good guy that's not in any of our numbers here. The real big bad guy is potentially out there, we don't know is what we faced last year was the global economy. And again, right now, things have started well, but that's hard to predict throughout there. So I feel good about where we are. I think that they're -- given the pricing there's more upside than downside in terms of opportunity. And so we feel like we played it down the middle.

Our next question comes from the line of Mike Roxland with Truist Securities.

Michael Roxland
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Some costs in North America appear to be more sticky, like mobile liability, et cetera. I mean, your volume is up for [ 2% ] in 4Q better than you expected, yet EBITDA missed. So wondering if you can speak to cost in North America, which ones are more problematic, sticker, how you intend to tackle them? And with the cost structure in North America, part of your calculus in terms of deciding to spin out Europe. And what I'm trying to get is if you have to deal with the cost structure that's a little bit more challenging than you expected, it's harder to tackle that plus having a European arm as well. So any color you can provide would be helpful.

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Yes. So on the cost side, look, I'm really happy with what we've done. We've taken out over $700 million in total cost when you look at the execution on that. So I'm very happy with the progress that we've made on that.

The things that are harder to get at, there's really two, right? One is the speed at which you take things down and all of those costs go away, right? So as you close a mill, there tend to be lingering costs during the shutdown and ultimately into the final closure and then potentially the sale or disposal of the property. Those tend to linger a little bit.

And then on the reliability front, it's as we have described, which is you've got to get in there and you've got to make the investments consistently over a period of time to drive the reliability and not have things pop up that can be very expensive in any given period. I mean, as you know, a singular mill struggling can be $100 million hit in a year easily, if a mill is really struggling.

And so we are putting -- aggressively investing back into our mill system in North America. And that's -- if you look at the expanded CapEx, if you look at the onetime accelerated transformation costs, even the Lighthouse rollout. Those are all things that we are doing to drive that reliability. It's absolutely showing up for the customers. They're feeling that positive reliability and it's showing up in their customer satisfaction numbers. It's showing up in our cost numbers. But it is, that's a slug fest. And you got to stick with it and the team is doing an excellent job.

On the European side, look, what Tim and team are doing in Europe is pretty exceptional. They are tackling structural costs in a way that's very unusual in the European marketplace. And you can see from the magnitude of what was on that one slide that we're getting after it. And so we're getting after it fast, and we'll continue to do that throughout 2026.

Michael Roxland
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Got it. Just one quick follow-up. I mean, so it sounds like with respect to Europe, the costs are -- the hard to get at and taking a little bit longer. So was that part of what was packed into your -- was that what you consider in terms of the spin? Was that a huge factor in terms of your consideration for spinning Europe? Because...

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

No, not at all. The real driver for this decision is the fact that the value is really in the regions. When you get right down to it and you look at where value is created, the acquisition and the combination, what it did was it created two regional powerhouses that really have very, very, very little overlap. I'm talking almost zero overlap in terms of how those businesses -- they're structured in the market, how those businesses go to market with customers and how you execute all the way from inputs, fiber supply all the way through the market. They're really distinctive markets. And so using 80/20 as the lens and as the mindset, you want to simplify, right? You want to take the complexity out, you want to focus on where the value is in the discrete markets. and then you want to get capital and people aligned and focused to those best opportunities. And that's really the driver there.

The exciting opportunity in Europe is even with the headwinds that the business had all of last year, with a combination of the war in Ukraine and trade tensions and the softness in the market is the business performed well relative to the marketplace and is getting after the changes in a way that's really distinctive to that marketplace. And this business coming out as a stand-alone business is going to have a great balance sheet. It's going to have great positioning in the market, top of its class in terms of customer satisfaction and the ability to direct and align people and capital to that unique mission, and that's really what this is all about. So I'm super excited for what Tim and the team have lined up. And as an independent company, I believe it's going to thrive having that focus and that aligned capital allocation. And the same thing in the U.S. And this really allows us for each to realize its unique mission and really drive incredible value.

Your next question comes from the line of Anojja Shah with UBS.

Anojja Shah
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I just wanted a quick clarification. So clearly, the price increase is not built into commercial initiatives in North America, I get that, I read you loud and clear. But in EMEA, the commercial initiative bucket is now $200 million in contribution. I think in Q3, it was $100 million. So what happened there? And can you confirm that if price goes down in Europe, whether that's already in that bucket or not?

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Yes. So specific to -- so yes, you're correct on North America first. There is nothing in there in terms of price. In EMEA, same thing. It's only things that have been executed, and we have line of sight to. So you have the underlying assumption of market growth in there, which, as Lance said, was 1.7%. And then you got a 0.5 point, which are wins that we know that we have today. And so we do not have incremental price that has not been -- that is not settled into the market built into there. So there is no price.

Now that being said, as I mentioned in my remarks, just as there's a $70 price increase in North America that's been put out into the marketplace by us to our customers. In Europe, there have been a lot of -- there's been a lot of activity, and there's about EUR 100 paper price increase has gone out in most markets. And what we don't know is whether kind of what's going to stick. It's a more dynamic market. In the U.S. on an annualized basis, if you got every penny of that, that's a little over $600 million, about $630 million. And in Europe, if you got every penny of that, it would be about $300 million incrementally from what we're talking about today. But in neither case do we have those built into the numbers.

Your next question comes from the line of Detlef Winckelmann with JPMorgan.

Detlef Winckelmann
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just if I can ask two, maybe the first one, regarding your commercial improvements year-on-year, that you've guided for now, it looks like about $100 million in North America. If I go back to third quarter, it was sitting at about $300 million based on your bridge that you gave. Just wondering if anything has changed and why the delta?

Lance Loeffler
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I don't know. I have to go back and look. Nothing rings a bell. I mean I think nothing has really changed other than the relationship that we've described. I think the extra $100 million is incremental to where we were in the third quarter. But we do have some commercial trade-offs that we've talked a lot about in North America about leaving the export business and the closure around Savannah.

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Yes. That might be part of what you're looking at there is that, that $100 million, if we're talking about North America, right, that is netted against the trade-offs with the export business that we have exited. Did we answer your question, Detlef? I want to make sure we got it.

Detlef Winckelmann
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes, I think so. It was kind of a net zero right in the beginning now to net $100 million. If I really -- correct me if I understand. And if I can ask 1 more follow-up. I mean, right from the beginning on your Investor Day, you were very helpful in giving an EMEA and North America split all the way to 2027. Now I know partway through the year, you said demand is a bit worse. Pricing came down a bit from your initial expectations. So I think you were talking about maybe Europe coming down a bit from that initial guide of, call it, $1.8 billion to $2 billion. I'm wondering, given the context of your $5 billion guide now, what Europe plays a part of in that, if you can share? Any color would be great?

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Yes. We haven't broken out specifically, but generally, you're talking about kind of $3.5 billion in North America and $1.5 billion in Europe.

Our last question today is going to come from the line of Matthew McKellar with RBC Capital Markets.

Matthew McKellar
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Just following up on questions for Charlie and Phil and apologies if I missed it, but is the 2% outperformance versus the North American industry you expect in '26 based solely on those customer wins you've seen so far, mostly in the back half of '25? Or have you assumed further wins and share gains as the year progresses as part of that outperformance assumption? And I guess with that, could there be upside to that number as the year progresses, given improved service quality and customer experience metrics you've highlighted?

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Yes. So those are -- this is a great question. Those are based on what we have line of sight to today, so business that we have won. So we don't need major incremental wins in this year to move the needle. And to be fair, right, what will move a needle in a short period are going to be local wins, right? The national business tends to be more on a contract cycle. And so we know what we won in 2025 that's now showing up in 2026. That's what we're communicating here. And then you'll have the local piece of business, which is much more day-to-day, much less contractual in there. So if we were to win incremental business throughout the year. Obviously, that would be an upside.

Operator

I'll now turn the call over to Andy Silvernail for closing comments.

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Well, thank you very much. I appreciate everybody joining us today. This is an important and a very exciting day for International Paper. The decision to split into two public companies to build two powerhouses that we have put together from the legacy pieces of International Paper and the legacy pieces of DS Smith now have two regions that are #1 in their regions have an exciting strategy in terms of cost position, how we're working with customers, how we're building our relative share position and ultimately, the financial upside that we see here, all of the hard work that's been put in the focus on 80/20, making really tough choices around assets and reinvesting back into the business aggressively to drive the customer service experience that we're seeing today, winning share, aggressively taking cost out and maximizing return on invested capital. When I look at that, I see two businesses that will stand on their own with great balance sheets with the ability to invest in their future with the ability to make dynamic capital allocation decisions to maximize value for shareholders. I'm very excited about that future. And I applaud the team for all the incredible work that they've done. I thank our shareholders for your interest in the business and what this can become and I'm incredibly excited about the future. Again, the year has started strong. We've seen a nice pickup in business here, and we're excited for the year to come and in the years to come. So thank you very much. Take care.
