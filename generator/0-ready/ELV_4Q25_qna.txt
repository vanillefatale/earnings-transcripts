Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions] For our first question, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from UBS.

Albert Rice
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I wonder, when you think about the cost trend across the major lines of businesses, I think the industry would say, and I think you guys would say that it was elevated in 2025 across Commercial, Medicaid, Medicare and Exchanges. I know Mark is saying that you have a mid-single-digit cost trend assumption in Medicaid, I believe, for -- in the '26 guidance. But I wondered if I could just get you to comment on, are you assuming sort of a similar cost trend in '26 in your embedded guidance to what you experienced in '25? Or is there any place you're assuming it gets worse or better?

Mark Kaye
Executive VP & CFO

AJ, thank you very much for that question. Briefly, I would say the fourth quarter medical cost performance across the Health Benefits segment came in generally in line to slightly better than our expectations. We did see some modest variations by line of business. And so we've carried that forward into our planning for 2026. To your question, in Commercial, within large group, we do expect cost patterns and margins to be largely consistent with what we saw in 2025, meaning an elevated but stable trend environment with some pockets of high utilization.

In ACA, we again expect accelerating cost trends, especially as the expiration of the enhanced premium subsidies affects the risk pool. We expect to do -- we do expect to see some healthy members exit. We do expect the remaining population to become more acute. In Medicaid, we expect cost pressure to remain pressured again in 2026 at roughly twice the historical average. And that's going to reflect elevated utilization.

It's going to reflect continued misalignment between rates and member acuity. That said, I would say, after 2 years of fairly unprecedented trend, we do expect some moderation versus 2025. So you could think about cost trend here moving into that mid-single-digit range per your question. And then finally, in Medicare, we anticipate higher reported cost trend in 2026, but that's going to be largely driven by our membership mix, including a greater emphasis on D-SNP. So overall, I'd say we're continuing to monitor trends very closely. We're comfortable with how we ended 2025, and we're very confident that our outlook for 2026 is prudent and appropriate.

Operator

Next, we'll go to the line of Andrew Mok from Barclays.

Andrew Mok
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Your 2026 membership declines generally came in larger than expected, especially on the Medicare side. Can you walk us through what played out during AEP that prompted the negative revisions and help us understand the components of membership declines within commercial risk between ACA and Employer Group?

Gail Boudreaux
President, CEO & Director

Thank you for the question, Andrew. I'm going to have Felicia Norwood start and then maybe Mark talk a little bit about the second part.

Felicia Norwood
Executive VP & President of Government Health Benefits

Andrew, thank you for the question. Our enrollment during AEP and the member composition is really aligned with our focus on margin. As you know, we took very deliberate steps to reposition our business to deliver sustainable value for our members and move the business towards our margin objectives. So while our outlook for our membership is going to be in the high teens percentage as Gail referenced, and this is below our expectations, we're really pleased at how members reacted to our emphasis on D-SNP as well as our HMO products as we go forward.

From a profitability perspective, I will say the mix of the lives that we lost was very consistent with our strategy. A majority of the attrition occurred in PPO products and in HMO products in geographies where we didn't offer a comparable alternative and where we were intentionally disciplined in repositioning our product vis-a-vis the broader market. The outcome that we've seen in January AEP reflects deliberate choices.

The products and the members that we exited were less aligned with our long-term objectives, particularly as we continue to focus on our D-SNP products. Importantly, and I think this is critical, we're positioned to deliver meaningful Medicare margin improvement to at least 2% in 2026, which is a meaningful step-up year-over-year. So very pleased with how things turned out, higher membership losses, but very consistent with the expectations. And then I'll turn it over to Mark for the rest of the responses.

Mark Kaye
Executive VP & CFO

And Andrew, on your question on the Employer Group risk membership, we are expecting to end 2026 down in the high single-digit percent range. And the short answer here is it's just a strong focus on margin discipline. Some of the expected decline is really driven by deliberate pricing decisions that we've made, maybe more specifically in a subset of accounts, including some of the lower or negative margin in the Public Sector business that we had. And we really did make a conscious decision to hold the line on pricing and not pursue business at returns below our margin thresholds.

Gail Boudreaux
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So thank you for the question. And I think the headline there again is this played out in a very disciplined way against the pricing expectations we set. And I think we feel very good about where we're coming into '26.

Operator

Next, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

I wanted to ask about margins in the Health Benefits business for '26. So you mentioned Medicaid margins of minus 1.75%. I appreciate the help there. And you did say that margins were a little better than expected, I think, Mark, in the fourth quarter. Can you expand on the drivers of that in terms of pricing and cost as you go into 2026? And then any color on where guidance assumption sits for margins for the exchanges and Medicare Advantage would be helpful as well.

Mark Kaye
Executive VP & CFO

Justin, thanks very much for the question. I thought a good place for me maybe to start here is really to talk about how we ended the year from a margin perspective, and then I'll give a little bit of color on 2026. So overall, Health Benefit margins very much in line with our outlook and our expectation. On Medicaid, margins were pressured in the fourth quarter, but they did track slightly better than our outlook that we gave in October, and that really reflected 2 things.

One, we had some favorable prior period development come through, and we also had some modest retroactive rates. If you exclude those 2 items, Medicaid margins completely in line with expectations. They still reflected that elevated utilization. They still reflected that ongoing reverification-driven risk deterioration and the misalignment of rates and acuity.

On Medicare, fourth quarter margins, inclusive of the IRA-driven Part D seasonality were largely in line with our expectations. They reflected the prudent assumptions that were embedded in our 2025 bids and overall guidance. And then in the Commercial Large Group, cost patterns and margins, I would say, were again largely consistent with our expectations. On the ACA side, a smidgen better than our prudent outlook.

Cost trends were significantly above historical levels, but again, very much in line with what we were expecting. And so as we think about 2026, the guidance that we put out this morning really incorporates that framework. And that really means that continued pressure in Medicaid, offset by improvement in Medicare Advantage, as you heard Felicia talk about, and then better performance in the individual ACA space.

And then lastly, I had a quick question on flu. So maybe let me go ahead and cover that here. We did see a meaningful uptick in influenza-like activity in December that did have a modest adverse impact on the fourth quarter benefit expense ratio. And we have carried some of that experience into our 2026 planning. So specifically, we are expecting first quarter headwind of about 20 basis points for flu that's already embedded in our outlook.

Operator

Next, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein.

Lance Wilkes
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

Great. In the Medicaid business, could you talk a little bit about rate outlook for 2026? And then could you help frame for us how we should be thinking about this on a go-forward basis with respect to -- obviously, you've given a trend estimate. But how should we be looking at kind of rate expectations, what states are doing as far as program changes? And then what are the opportunities and the achievable objectives for medical management?

Gail Boudreaux
President, CEO & Director

Felicia?

Felicia Norwood
Executive VP & President of Government Health Benefits

Lance, thank you for the question. We are contemplating a composite rate increase in 2026 in the mid-single-digit percent range, net of certain known risk corridor impacts. I will say the final rates that we've received from states for January. And as you know, January represents about 1/3 of our Medicaid premium. Those rates were in line with our expectations. But for these states, the rates, while modestly above the historical levels, will still lag trend in 2026, given the ongoing membership attrition and the shifting risk pools we continue to see as a result of some ongoing state reverification activity.

You mentioned program changes. I will say the rate discussions today are increasingly tied to broader program changes and benefit designs that state are more receptive to consideration. And I think that's very important as we think about trying to maintain long-term sustainability and the adjustments that need to be made in states around budget challenges that we're going to see in 2026.

We are always engaged in constructive conversations with our state partners, and we're also taking actions ourselves to help control what states are seeing in terms of their Medicaid budgets by doing all of the things that states expect that's tightening our cost management, increasingly focused on those high trend drivers that you heard earlier around behavioral health, ABA and other services and certainly very much engaged in program integrity activities to make sure that the program reflects soundness as we look at ongoing issues in the program.

So good constructive conversations with rates, a continued lag though, in terms of the trend. But I would say we continue to be very engaged in having a program that's long-term sustainable in our Medicaid program.

Operator

Next, we'll go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research.

Joshua Raskin
Nephron Research LLC

Maybe just big picture. If you could give us a little bit more details and speak to what gives you that confidence to confirm the long-term EPS growth target of 12% plus starting in 2027 in light of the trends that you've seen in the past 2 years. Is there something specific in Medicare or Medicaid or the Commercial markets that suggest an opportunity to start growing earnings in '27? Or are you seeing something in Carelon side that maybe leads to a stronger acceleration of growth there? And lastly, I assume this includes your view of the 2027 MA rates post the prelim notice.

Gail Boudreaux
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thank you for the question, Josh. I think it helps as we frame '27. Let's start with '26. We guided to an adjusted diluted EPS of at least $25.50. And again, as I shared, we see that outlook is prudent and achievable, and it's based on actions that are already underway to reposition our business and improve margins across the enterprise.

So as I step back, '25 was about strengthening the foundation. We tightened pricing discipline. We did -- we improved our execution, and we advanced our affordability through Carelon. And as you just heard Mark, the fundamentals came in where we expected them to. And I think that work matters as we think about the next few years because it gives us a very clear line of sight and a lot of confidence in the outlook that we're laying. So my headline for '26, it's all about execution. The fundamentals are there.

Looking to '27, we have confidence in at least 12% adjusted EPS growth coming off of our '26 ending baseline. And again, that's because it's driven by the same fundamentals that we saw at the end of '25 and into '26. Again, over the past 2 years, we've made very specific portfolio targeted decisions. Our pricing has hardened and our operating decisions are designed to protect our earnings base and position the enterprise for durable growth. That leverages the unique capabilities.

And I think our diversified platform, we're going to start to see come through. And there's 3 points I just want to underscore. First, the key earnings levers are already in motion. So that puts us in place for '25 and '26. Again, pricing care management and the portfolio we feel are positioned. Second, our '26 outlook is intentionally prudent. So the actions -- so as those actions mature, we can capture more operating leverage, and that sets up a clear step-up into 2027.

And third, and I think this is really important to your question, the path isn't predicated on a single assumption. It's built on multiple independent levers and disciplined execution across Commercial, Medicare, Carelon and Medicaid. And that's why we have the confidence both in the '27 and in long term -- in our long-term earnings algorithm. And that confidence is behind our outlook in 2026 and the growth in '27. So hopefully, that provides some clarity. Thank you for the question.

Operator

Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan.

Lisa Gill
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I want to go back to Mark's comments on the investments that were pulled forward. Mark, I want to make sure that I heard you correctly, you said it was roughly $1 of investments, but a quarter was pulled forward. So should I think that $0.75 is still embedded in your guidance for 2026? And can you talk about specifically what buckets those investments are in? And how do we think about how it flows through the model?

Mark Kaye
Executive VP & CFO

Lisa, thanks very much for the question. Maybe let me do a little bit of a broader framing, and then I'll get specifically to your question. So our results this morning do include $3.75 of discrete noncore items embedded in our outlook. And that is, to your point, $0.75 more favorable than what we contemplated in our October call. So what changed versus prior expectations?

Well, that incremental favorability, that was driven entirely by strategic tax items that came in better than expected as we finalize results, particularly in the fourth quarter. And importantly, and I want to emphasize this point here, underlying operating performance came in as expected, meaning medical cost trends, operating execution, they're consistent with our outlook.

So given that outperformance in those tax-related benefits, we made 2 intentional decisions. One, we pulled forward 1/4 of the approximately $1 of incremental investments that we had previously planned for 2026. And two, we deployed an additional $0.25 towards retention and targeted workforce investments here. And so it gives us a lot of confidence as we set the baseline for 2026.

Operator

Next, we'll go to the line of Ann Hynes from Mizuho Securities.

Ann Hynes
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

I know in your long-term guidance, you're lowering the margin profile of each segment. Within the Healthcare Benefits segment, can you let us know what changed for your long-term targets for Medicaid, Medicare and Commercial? And then on Carelon, it looks like you are lowering the Rx part of it. Is that just driven by membership losses? Or is there anything else that's lowering that target?

Mark Kaye
Executive VP & CFO

So most important here, we have not changed the underlying margin expectations for any line of business within Health Benefits. And that continues to reflect the risk that we assume and the value that we deliver for employers and the government programs that we support. What has changed is how we calibrate the Health Benefits segment margin to the portfolio we are operating today, applying the same line of business margin framework that we've always used.

So as we've worked through an elevated cost trend environment, I would say Commercial growth has been more measured than we originally anticipated, also as we prioritize disciplined pricing and margin integrity over volume. At the same time, the composition within Commercial that's also evolved. So individual ACA now represents a larger share of the segment relative to Group Commercial, and that obviously carries a different margin profile.

And so when you reflect these dynamics through the existing line of business margin ranges, the result is that mid-single-digit Health Benefits segment margin expectation. And so the key point here, look, this is not about a change in strategy or change in underwriting discipline or pricing. This is just a recalibration to better reflect the mix of our business today and a prudent view of the operating environment.

Gail Boudreaux
President, CEO & Director

And why don't we have Pete talk a little bit about Carelon.

Peter Haytaian
Executive VP and President of Carelon & CarelonRx

Okay. No, thanks a lot for the question, Ann. So you asked about the Rx margins longer term. And yes, we are adjusting them. It's a positive story around really growth and diversification of our portfolio. As we talked about, we're seeing a lot of growth in Rx. And in fact, just to reflect on what happened this past year, headed into 2026, it was our best growth year ever. And part of that is the composition of the business that we're growing through.

We're starting to see a lot more large upmarket jumbo accounts flowing through our business. That's one factor, and that comes with a different margin profile. In addition, we continue to build out our specialty business, and that's going really well, both internally and externally. And again, that comes with a bit of a lower margin profile.

And you've heard Gail and Mark talk about the investments that we're making in that regard. And then finally, I would say, longer term, we're very mindful and respectful of what's going on from a policy perspective. And I think we're being very prudent in this regard as we think about the longer-term profile of the Rx business. Thanks for that question.

Operator

Next, we'll go to the line of Ryan Langston from TD Cowen.

Christian Borgmeyer
TD Cowen, Research Division

This is Christian Borgmeyer on for Ryan Langston. Can you share where you began the year in terms of ACA membership after the annual enrollment period? Data on sign-ups nationally came in higher than we expected given the expiring subsidies but I know there's some attrition typically in the first quarter. And I know it's early in the year, but any notable changes in utilization patterns from this line of business in January?

Mark Kaye
Executive VP & CFO

Christian, thank you very much for the question. On the individual ACA, we are guiding towards at least 900,000 members at year-end 2026. And that outlook really reflects 2 drivers here. First, the expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits, which we expect is going to pressure retention and increase lapse activity; and second, intentional exits that we've made as part of our repositioning of the book for a more sustainable profile.

Importantly, coming out of open enrollment, membership is up approximately 10%, and that's helped in part by some of the modest growth that we've seen in markets we first entered in 2025, which offsets some of the intentional attrition that we expected in our core blue states. Overall, I'd say trends through open enrollment are largely in line with what we've seen in the broader market.

The key swing factor, and I think this gets to the heart of your question, is really now effectuation rates. And that's going to come down to member premium payments and lapse behavior. And that typically is going to become much clearer through early April as members work through that normal billing cycle over the next few months.

Operator

Next, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Goldman Sachs.

Scott Fidel
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Just interested if you could provide us with an update on capital deployment priorities for the 2026. And in particular, maybe just sort of touch on the M&A priorities in terms of, one, just appetite for doing transactions this year, just given the dynamic backdrop. And then two, looking over the last several years, certainly, you've had a lot of activity on the M&A side on Carelon Services and in particular, acquiring risk-based platforms to integrate into that. Just interested if that remains a priority at this point or whether you're more focused on integration of those assets you've acquired over the last several years.

Mark Kaye
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you very much for the question. I would say in the near term, our capital allocation is going to reflect a more conservative posture. Our priority here look is to maintain balance sheet strength and strong credit profile, fund targeted investments that accelerate margin stabilization and Carelon's continued growth and then to remain opportunistic around share repurchases, especially where we see compelling value.

Over the longer term, the capital allocation framework is unchanged. We remain completely committed to a balance sheet approach or balanced approach that supports our long-term growth algorithm, including reinvestment back into the business, disciplined M&A focused on some of the integration or integrated capabilities that have strengthened our competitive position and then, of course, consistent capital return back to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

On M&A specifically, our near-term priority is really focused on that integration and execution, really fully scaling and realizing the value from recent acquisitions. And so at least in the first half of 2026, you should expect a lower level of M&A activity and a much greater relative emphasis on opportunistic share repurchases.

Operator

Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America.

Kevin Fischbeck
BofA Securities, Research Division

Great. I wanted to follow up kind of on this margin commentary and the changes that you're doing there. I guess maybe putting it in a framework of just the changes that you had in the enrollment across the different businesses. I definitely applaud when managed care companies exit markets that aren't profitable, low margin. I think it's 100% the right thing to do.

But given that the membership numbers have been lower than we would have thought, I guess, across most of the products, is there anything that we should be reading into as far as where you are strategically or competitively in these markets? The magnitude is more than we would have expected, and it's a broad-based across-the-board dynamics. So just trying to understand there's something we should be reading into this and why like this business mix that you're now forecasting is different than the business mix you thought a few years ago when you provided your previous margin assumptions?

Gail Boudreaux
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks for the question. I guess I would simply say the headline is no. This is a very disciplined approach in each of the businesses. And let me just touch on them. In the Commercial business, we made very specific decisions around the ACA and feel very good about the sustainability of where the platform and the membership is coming out. As you heard from Mark a few minutes ago, I think we've been -- we positioned ourselves well for sustainable business there.

On the broader Commercial risk-based business, we actually had quite high retention amongst our Commercial business, but made some very conscious pricing decisions around public sector accounts that have been below profitability. So again, this is a repositioning of the portfolio ready for growth. On the ASO, we had a very strong national account selling season with great retention.

I think Medicaid represents really just the redetermination impacts, but we continue to grow and have won accounts in some of the more complex populations. So again, feel good there. And I feel very good about the positioning in Medicare Advantage. We came into this. We are very clear what we needed to do. As you heard, we believe we have improved our margin and again, our sustainability. So I actually would say where we are entering '26, we feel quite strongly positioned for future growth in a very sustainable, strong margin position. So thanks for the question.

Operator

Next, we'll go to Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley.

Erin Wilson Wright
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So clearly, the industry was somewhat caught off guard with the MA rate notice this week. And just can you remind us of just your response? I think we know that to some extent, but your just ability to mitigate this on top of the cuts that you're making this year as well. I assume you'll continue to take a disciplined approach here.

And just your thoughts on what this means for the industry, for the MA market as a whole and from a policy perspective and what we could see going forward? And just do you think also more specifically, some of the risk adjustment changes being made, are you more or less exposed relative to the industry on that front?

Gail Boudreaux
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Well, thank you for the question, Erin. I'll start with just your sort of between the lines question, which is we will continue to take a very disciplined approach and positioning of our Medicare book. But I think it's important to start off by first framing the implications of the advanced notice. Medicare Advantage is a critically important program for seniors, and it brings together, as we've said, affordable coverage, coordinated care and supplemental benefits that members rely on to stay healthy and independent.

We are still going through the details. We just got them of the advanced notice. But at a high level, the advanced notice is effectively flat, which you've all reported on. And quite frankly, it just doesn't keep pace with the current medical cost and utilization trends, and that does create real pressure on benefit stability and affordability for seniors. For MA to remain strong, the program needs to be stable and sustainable and stability gets undermined when payment rates don't keep pace with the utilization and cost trends, especially as the member's needs grow more and more complex.

So we're going to continue to advocate, obviously, because if funding consistently lags the reality on the ground, the levers that we have are benefits, networks, premiums and exiting geographies. And quite frankly, that's not good for seniors, and I don't think it's good for the program. And we do believe this -- we see more than 55% of seniors selecting this program. So it's very popular.

We're also supportive of the measures that protect the integrity of the risk adjustment program. Now if you think back, risk adjustment exists for a reason. It's to ensure that plans are paid appropriately for the health status of the members they serve. So as we look ahead, we're going to continue to work with CMS on 2 things that have to go together.

One is the appropriate funding that reflects the actual utilization and cost trends to support program stability; and two, as changes to that risk adjustment framework are proposed, they need to be accurate and predictable and trusted to avoid disruption, I think, and negatively impacting seniors. So our priority is, again, work with CMS and also protect seniors access and affordability because we know it's a very popular program that delivers significant value for seniors. So thanks very much for the question.

Operator

Next, we'll go to the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets.

Benjamin Hendrix
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I just wanted to go back quickly to the Carelon margin discussion. You noted expansion of risk-based solutions in Carelon Services through 2025. I was wondering if you could remind us of the new services and/or product lines that -- where you're taking risk? And to what degree could that expansion provide any offset to the shifting margin dynamics you mentioned in CarelonRx?

Gail Boudreaux
President, CEO & Director

I'll have Pete address your question. Thank you.

Peter Haytaian
Executive VP and President of Carelon & CarelonRx

No, thanks for that question. I think it's important to step back and just talk about how we address risk in Carelon because I think it's very important strategically. We're very intentional and disciplined about how we do that and take on risk. We, as you noted, have a diverse set of services and products and offerings. And importantly, in the infrastructure of Carelon, we're very disciplined around cost of care and managing trend across all these relationships.

I'd also say that we have a good mix of fee-based business as well as risk business. And then when you break down our risk portfolio, we approach it in a very different way, in a diverse way, where we're taking risk on a category of service basis in some cases as well as on a whole health risk basis. And again, we built in appropriate protections with risk corridors and discipline in terms of how we approach that.

So I do think from an enterprise perspective, the way we approach that is very important in protecting our growth and our margin profile. In terms of the services in which we deploy risk because you asked that as well, it varies. In most of our product offerings, we are assuming risk, like I said, sometimes on a category of care basis or on a whole risk basis.

In some instances, we're on a fee basis, but we're excited about the proliferation of that and our advancement of whole health going forward. When you think about our new offerings like SMI, when you think about what we're doing around oncology, when you think about what's happening with CareBridge, these are all risk offerings that are deploying a lot of value from a cost of care and quality perspective for the enterprise.

Gail Boudreaux
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Pete. And the only thing I'd say is we have a very strong external growth pipeline, which I think validates what Pete is saying. And again, we're looking at serving the more complex populations based on the experience we have in our own health plans. So a lot of those programs around oncology, severe mental illness, orthopedics really give us a growth opportunity. So thank you for the question.

Operator

Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies.

David Windley
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I wanted to ask on the Medicaid membership expected decline, is that all same-store? Or does that contemplate an exit of a state or an end of a contract, I'm thinking about Georgia. And then the 9% in total is a little bit higher than we were expecting. Your 125 basis points, I think, of margin pressure in Medicaid is consistent with what you had said before. And so I wanted to try to reconcile those that, that additional membership decline doesn't further disrupt the margin.

Felicia Norwood
Executive VP & President of Government Health Benefits

Dave, thank you for the question. You're right, we've guided to Medicaid membership decline around 750,000 members for 2026. And this really reflects really same store. So a continuation of the challenges that we've seen across states as some states have really implemented more stringent eligibility reverification requirements, and that has happened. It happened consistently in 2025, and we thought it was very important to be prudent as we took a look at 2026 to maintain that same posture. We're continuing to work closely with our states, but certain eligibility requirements as well as program changes will lead to some of those reductions in 2026.

Mark Kaye
Executive VP & CFO

And then, Dave, how that carries in forward into our margin guidance of approximately negative 1.75% for the year is really grounded in 3 core assumptions. Number one, cost trend is going to remain elevated. We have planned for medical cost trend in that mid-single-digit percent range, still materially above historical norms.

Number two, rates, as we discussed earlier on the call, are going to improve, but they will still lag trends. And you can think about that as roughly 1/3 of those Medicaid premiums reset in January. And then third, we're not relying on rates alone. We are using all the levers we control, [ tighter ] medical and pharmacy cost management, expanded BH interventions, et cetera. And so taken together, we think our outlook for Medicaid margin is prudent for 2026.

Operator

Next, we'll go to the line of Sarah James from Cantor Fitzgerald.

Sarah James
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

Commercial risk guidance is down about 700,000 lives while ACA is growing. Can you quantify how much of that decline reflects pricing actions on those government accounts versus employers shifting preference to ASO? And in your long-term Health Benefits margin guidance, does the mix change assume further commercial risk attrition or mainly the impact of the actions taken this year?

Mark Kaye
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks very much for the question. Maybe just a moment here to clarify. So on the individual ACA, we are guiding to at least 900,000 members at year-end 2026. And it's important to put that in the context of obviously where we ended 2025. For the Employer Group risk-based membership, we do expect a decline year-over-year in that high single-digit percent range.

We spoke a little bit about that earlier, and that's primarily because we're prioritizing margins. And then finally, in ASO, we are expecting a pretty good season. I'm actually going to ask Morgan to help here because he deserves a lot of credit for our success in how we're guiding 2026.

Morgan Kendrick

Thanks, Mark, and thanks, Sarah. Regarding the ASO business, national accounts, and Gail mentioned to it earlier, has had just a spectacular year, which I think sort of speaks to the health of the assets across the entire enterprise when you look at it. And a couple of things were sort of driving that. We -- Gail mentioned at the beginning of the conference today around second Blue bid, where this is the first year that we've had the opportunity for employers in competing geographies against us could actually quote with our organization if they wanted. So when we think about how it came together, we've got about -- we had about 11 bids in the second Blue category for 2026, won 9 of them.

And the tee up of the actual pipeline for 2027 looks strong and also '28 as we sit here. So whether we're talking the local markets or the national markets, the self-funded business has done quite well. We expect it to continue to. And with that, as you also heard from Pete earlier, the pull-through with the CarelonRx has been really, really strong and notably in the upmarket where it had not been formerly. So we're pleased with it and look forward to continued success.

Operator

Next, we'll go to the line of Jason Cassorla from Guggenheim.

Jason Cassorla

Maybe just a question on aggregate Carelon. It looks like for '26, revenue is growing across both Rx and services. Margins are generally holding in for both despite the enrollment losses for your Health Benefits business. Maybe can you just help unpack or bifurcate CarelonRx and services revenue and margin impacts, specifically coming from the Health Benefits enrollment losses versus perhaps the growth and margin maturation you're seeing from external clients would be helpful.

Gail Boudreaux
President, CEO & Director

All right. I'll let Pete address that.

Peter Haytaian
Executive VP and President of Carelon & CarelonRx

Yes. No, thanks for that question. Let's step back and just talk about first setting up Carelon for 2026 of what we came off of in 2025, which was very, very strong. I think you saw that come through. We had almost 60% growth on the services side and on the pharmacy side over 20% growth. And we're very encouraged in terms of what we're selling, diversity of services, our growing portfolio of solutions.

We launched CareBridge last year. On the Rx side, as I noted before, we're selling upmarket to a much greater degree. And importantly, that momentum is continuing into 2026 with respect to your question, external sales. In fact, I'll emphasize this. We had the best year both in services as well as Rx in terms of external growth. And when I mentioned external growth on the pharmacy side, that's the integrated ASO growth going forward.

As you noted, those tailwinds are being offset by affiliated membership attrition. And when you think about services, we also had one large external client, which we had planned for that went from a risk basis to a fee basis. But that was the largest driver in terms of headwinds overall. If you step back though, and you take out that internal membership headwind, our overall growth would have been on the services side, high teens, low 20s. And on the Rx side, in the low double-digit range. So consistent with what we've guided to longer term. And I would think of that as a mid-single-digit sort of op gain impact on the affiliated membership.

Thank you, Pete. I think we have time for one last question.

And for our final question, we'll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank.

I really appreciate you sneaking me in at the end. Mark, the topic where I'm getting the most questions is, can you just contextualize a little bit more what does the ending baseline mean? You talked about earnings for fiscal '26 being front-end loaded. Should we kind of be thinking about that last period run rate as the baseline for 12% growth? And then maybe talk about any visibility to any onetime items in '26 and whether or not they'll be included or excluded from the baseline.

Mark Kaye
Executive VP & CFO

George, thanks very much for the question. This is really a good one to conclude on. So let me try to bring it together the key themes and messages that we've delivered on the call today. So we have established the 2026 EPS guidance of at least $25.50, and anchored in what I consider very prudent, achievable assumptions supported by actions that we have already taken or underway to reposition our business and improve margins across the enterprise.

And at a high level, you could think about the EPS bridge to $25.50 as really being driven by a few key building blocks. Stable performance in Commercial Fully Insured and continued strength in Commercial Fee-Based, continued progress towards sustainable performance in ACA, Medicaid margins compressing to approximately negative 1.75%, consistent with our view that 2026 is the trough year, more than 100 basis points of operating margin improvement in Medicare Advantage to at least 2%, low single-digit operating gain growth in Carelon where external momentum is partially masked by those affiliated Health Benefit membership declines.

And then below the line, a meaningful step down, reflecting the nonrecurrence of the 2025 investment income and a return to a more normalized tax rate. So putting all of that together, again, the guidance of $25.50 prudent, achievable assumption.

Gail Boudreaux
President, CEO & Director
