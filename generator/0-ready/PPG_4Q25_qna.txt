[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research.

Christopher Parkinson
Wolfe Research, LLC

Most of us would still call the macro muted or even meager, and your organic growth with maybe one exception has been pretty solid across a lot of the kind of the substrates and the fastest you've been focusing on the last few years. Could you just add a little bit of insight on what you saw in the fourth quarter and how you're thinking about everything in 2026 in terms of breaking that growth down in was the macro actually slightly better than you anticipated? Is it all share gain? Is it new product introductions? If you could just kind of just break that down and how that breakdown would actually lead you to think about your '26 guidance that would be particularly helpful.

Timothy Knavish
CEO & Chairman

Chris, I guess a high-level answer, and I'll get into some details for you here. The high-level answer is macro is not better than we expect. And to your questions about is our growth based on macro share gain or technology introductions? The answer is yes, yes and yes.

So the spaces where we're seeing macro help aerospace, right? That continues to crush it for us. The sequential improvement in Mexico that helps us. And it is still a pretty strong, robust PMC market.

When you look across the rest of our businesses, well, and those businesses, if you think about auto OEM, S&P has Q1 down. The rest of the year, call it, flattish, but we're committed to outperform in that, and we will grow.

Packaging industry is very mixed bag, and we're crushing it there with multiple quarters of double digit. And that's largely share gain, and I would tell you, largely Europe, where we're doing quite well there. If you look at the other businesses, Architectural Europe, still flattish. Industrial or general industrial, which, as you know, is the catch all, it's -- some segments are up, some are down; overall, I'd still call it pretty flat. So really, there's a few markets where we're getting macro help. Most of our businesses were getting share gain help.

And to the technology question, a lot of the share that we're gaining in packaging is technology driven. A lot of the share that we're gaining in Refinish, even though the destocking is covering this right now, a lot of the share gain is driven by the productivity tools that we launch.

So it's really a combination of all three. But high level, I don't think anything has changed significantly with our view of the macro.

Your next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Aleksey Yefremov
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Thanks for providing all the color on end markets. I was hoping you could just give us some details on total volumes and price for organic growth in '26?

Timothy Knavish
CEO & Chairman

Sure. Let me do the easy one first, and that's pricing. You should expect to see positive price in virtually all of the protective businesses -- I'm sorry, performance businesses and the Architectural businesses. You heard my -- even our most challenged region for Architectural in Europe, we've gotten price 39 straight quarters. I don't see us breaking that streak. And of course, our position, our strength in Mexico will capture price there. So you'll see price there; Refinish, aerospace, to a lesser degree, PMC -- so those 2 segments will definitely have positive price.

Now in Industrial segment, I would call it flattish, but we do have 2 slight negatives. We still do have a little bit of index pricing carryover. And automotive -- frankly, automotive in China, we see some low single-digit price declines, frankly, that are offset by lower raw materials than we expected in China.

But all in, you'll see performance in Architectural offset a little bit of decline in Industrial. Volume-wise, we're on a pretty good trend. You'll continue to see volume growth in aerospace, PMC, packaging; modest volume growth in Architectural. You'll see volume growth in auto OEM. Frankly, we've had second -- 2 quarters in a row of beating market there, and we're optimistic about doing that throughout 2026. And that's driven by share gains. And then as we move through the year, I think you'll start to see some more in General Industrial where some of the share gain wins that we've had will actually come to launch. So thank you for the question, Alex.

Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.

Kevin McCarthy
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Tim, it was nice to see you finish up the year at plus 3% on organic sales growth. If I look at the EBITDA line, though, it was relatively flat. And so I was wondering if you could walk us through your thoughts on operating leverage. It seems as though raw materials are pretty benign and you've been taking costs out of the company as per your restructuring. And so maybe why did EBITDA not grow more in the quarter? And more importantly, how do you see that trending as 2026 progresses?

Timothy Knavish
CEO & Chairman

Yes. Kevin, there's several contributors, but the one that by far drives that math is the Refinish destocking. As you know, that Refinish is one of our higher-margin businesses. So when it's down, you've got destocking. I think we were down double digits in Q3, high single digits in Q4. That just -- it overwhelms the positivity of the other businesses' organic growth just given its margin profile. So what you should expect to see there, unfortunately, you'll see some of that in Q1 and Q2. I think you'll see it sequentially get better as the other businesses kick it in more and more pricing kicks in, more of our cost out and productivity kick in. But really, where you'll see that flip is once we get back to the normal buying patterns, which will be the second half of the year.

Vincent Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Kevin, let me -- this is Vince. Just let me remind everybody, our segment earnings did grow in the fourth quarter. So they were up about $20 million year-over-year.

Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.

Vincent Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I wanted to dig in a little bit more on Refinish. If I think of some of the metrics that have been discussed over the last couple of calls, I think third quarter claims were down mid-single digits, but 4Q claims are back down high singles. So you noted, Tim, that December was only down 2%. And I believe in the answer to Kevin's question, you're still anticipating the sort of second half recovery and normalization of customer shipments. So could you just help us tie all that together with sort of the latest update and what you're hearing from customers as well as not just -- and how you're interpreting all that claims data?

Timothy Knavish
CEO & Chairman

Yes. Thanks, Vincent. And if you don't mind, I'm going to [ pick ] the rather holistic answer here and try to answer all the Refinish questions here, as I want to make sure we leave time to get to everything in the portfolio here. So I'm going to answer maybe your question and more when it comes to Refinish.

So the headline I'd say is there's nothing that indicates a huge change for us versus what we told you at the end of Q3 relative to the industry and to our trajectory. However, we are seeing what I would call some reinforcing green shoots as we move through the quarter, okay? So we're still very confident in our best-in-class productivity solutions to grow share, and that's happening. We have market share momentum that's happening largely in the U.S., but also across Europe. This is and will be a very good business for PPG as we work through this transitory kind of period, just given the strength of our position versus others.

I will also add that there is clearly industry anxiety out there, partly driven by the pressure that body shops have been on for the last 18 months, but also driven by consolidations, divestitures in this industry. And what all of those anxieties play to our strength, one, because of the strength of our productivity offering, but second, because of the certainty of continuity that we provide. Insurance rate spikes were really the key driver to this disproportionate drop in claims over the last 1.5 years or so. Okay? And that led to -- or leading to multi-quarter destocking in our channel. I mentioned last time how it ties to our rebate structure, et cetera.

And we said at the last quarter, we expect normalization of buying patterns from our distributors in the second half of 2026. And normal, I'll remind everybody, would be kind of low single-digit claims down. And that's very good. Normal is very good for PPG because our track record for decades shows that at that kind of level, we can put up record after record because of the strength of our offering.

Now if you look at our guide, I'll remind you to everybody that we had a very strong first half of 2025, combined with a pretty weak second half of 2025. So when you combine that with what we're saying now, which is, okay, destocking for 2 quarters, sales volume and EBIT growth in Q3 and Q4, that really explains a lot of the EPS difference between the first half of the year and the second half of the year. So that's kind of the fundamentals.

Now updates. Everything we're seeing and hearing from our customers since we last spoke is playing out as expected. Distributors are destocking as we expected. Body shops are starting to see the beginning signs of normalization as we expected. And thus, we reinforced our guide today. The few points of reinforcement and green shoots because of 2 things, strength of our productivity offering and the anxieties in the marketplace that I mentioned, we're winning a lot of share.

We saw -- you saw one public announcement yesterday. There are a lot of other ones happening that are not publicly announced and there are more to come. Second, insurance premiums are normalizing, okay? So kind of the catalyst for this whole cycle is beginning to normalize. We continue to reinforce the strength of our productivity offering. Two things we did just this quarter, we launched the next chapter of digital tools for the body shops, beyond MoonWalk, beyond LINQ, beyond VisualizID, we launched a new digital tool called Mix'n'Shake, which drives further body shop productivity savings, and that's being well received. And we also launched our first AI formulated product in Refinish to -- again, to help body shops be more productive.

So the industry is playing out as we expected. We're winning share with our solutions. It reinforces our guide to see destocking in first half, normalized order pattern in the second half. Two other things that happened notably in December. You did see the minus 2% claims. One data point, I get that, but you got to start somewhere. So let's watch that closely as we move through the first half of '26.

And we did start to see what we call fill-in orders from our distributors, okay? So this multi-quarter destocking, you can only destock so far before you've got to supply the body shops, and that's when you start seeing fill-in orders. And we did start to see those in December. So another reinforcing sign.

So all that added up -- we expect a muted first half for continued destocking, second half return to sales and EBIT growth for Refinish and a more normalized distributor buying pattern. So just one other thing, more for the segment and to speak to the strength of our portfolio despite a challenging back half of the year in one of our best margin businesses. The Performance Coatings segment still put up a record sales year and a record earnings year for the full year '25. So the strength of our portfolio just really comes through there when things like PMC, Aerospace and Traffic can offset this transitory period of Refinish.

So I hope I answered your question and more on Refinish. It's playing out as we expected. And obviously, more data points to come as we move through Q1 and Q2.

Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.

David Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Tim, on Aerospace, can you tell us what the growth -- the sales growth was in 2025? And are you at all capacity constrained in '26 ahead of the new supply capacity coming on next year?

Timothy Knavish
CEO & Chairman

Yes. Thanks, David. The growth rate for 2025 was double digit. By the way, it was double digit in '24 as well. So we expect continued growth. You're starting to lap double digit on top of double digit. Denominators are getting bigger. By the way, this business is almost the same size as Refinish now. So the denominator is getting bigger and bigger as you start lapping multiple double digits. So we're guiding high single digits for 2026, I think, for Aerospace.

We are capacity constrained. No doubt about it. We -- that's why our CapEx has been above our historical norm for the last couple of years. Round numbers, I approved about $120 million of CapEx last year that I would call incremental aerospace debottlenecking CapEx expansion. We've also brought in a number of consultants to help us just with debottlenecking on the expense side. And that's why you see some of the margin challenges that I think Kevin asked about. And in addition to that $120 million or so, we announced $380 million new factory. That will take about 2 years to bring online for the sealants and coatings side of the business. And we're working on some other capacity expansions. I can't get ahead of my Board here, but we're not done. This business will be growing likely for the rest of my career. And hopefully, that's longer than Mr. Morales' career here. But -- so we see that coming for -- as far as our forecasts go.

Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho.

John Ezekiel Roberts
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Congrats on a long career, Vince, and best wishes. Could you talk a little bit more about the depth of the AI reformulation activity going on? You launched the first product in Refinish. And how broad is this across the industry? Does PPG have a differentiated position or are the consultants sort of bringing AI to all the Coatings companies?

Timothy Knavish
CEO & Chairman

Yes. John, we're super excited about this. There are things in AI that consultants are bringing to everybody. And I would say that's more kind of back office, customer service, the finance transaction processing. Those are things that are kind of table stakes that everybody is doing. Formulation AI. This is internally developed, working with a few partners, but it's organically internally developed, and we believe it's a differentiator. Now I'm guessing our competitors are out there trying to work on it and catch up, but we believe we're definitely out front here.

And we've launched, commercialized a Refinish Clearcoat that optimizes performance of the end Coating as well as productivity in the body shop for our customers. We launched that. It was the first product fully developed using AI, but it's not based on anything public. It's based on scraping all of our internal formulations that we've developed over 100 years and optimizing. So that is commercialized.

Beyond that, -- we've launched another 50 products already where they were existing products in the marketplace that we've used AI to optimize both from a product performance standpoint and a cost to PPG standpoint, 50 products already since we made that first announcement. Going forward, we'll continue to both optimize existing formulations, but we've got development projects like we did in Refinish across virtually all of our businesses. So more to come there. And I hope you hear a little kick in my step on this one, John, because I'm pretty excited not only about where we are, but where we're going.

Vincent Morales
Senior VP & CFO

John, this is Vince. Let me add a little here. The precursor to this was really the scraping of the data that Tim described. So we were fortunate, a couple of years ago we digitized a lot of our data -- so that we think that puts us in a -- maybe the pole position, certainly in the front row in the industry because of that activity was very time consuming, and we did it a couple of years ago that allowed us to now take advantage of that digitized data.

Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.

John McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Tim, over the last couple of years, you've dialed back investment in inorganic growth. You've really focused internally, and it seems like it's delivered. You've gotten share gains, like you were saying from technology, from service, the whole 9 yards. And it seems like you're able to outpace your markets right now. I guess, as we look forward, just given the strength of the balance sheet, the strength of the cash flows, is that still pretty much the main focus where, look, inorganic growth really isn't necessary for PPG going forward and you keep focusing on the internal opportunities?

Or have you played a lot of that out? And now that you're in a stronger position, do you start looking maybe a little bit more aggressively at acquisitions? I guess how should we be thinking about that?

Timothy Knavish
CEO & Chairman

John, great question. So they're both important to us. But the tip of the spear, as I always say, continues to be building this organic growth and margin engine because I believe in many, if not most of the cases, we can deliver better shareholder returns by making those investments in organic growth, organic productivity, organic cost out, et cetera.

Now, we still will do acquisitions, either bolt-ons or someday transformational. We still believe that the industry needs some consolidation, and we're supporters of that. We still believe there are acquisitions that will add value to PPG's customers and shareholders that can be tuck-ins from a technology standpoint or reinforce our position somewhere. But I would say that it's organic first; we still look at every opportunity, we put it through a filter of, is it the right asset that's consistent with our enterprise growth strategy, where it gives us a strong #1 or #2 or reinforces a strong #1 or #2.

Is it the right asset? Is it the right time given everything else that we have going on so that we can ensure that we cannot fall back in a trap where we had built this excellent inorganic muscle, but not an excellent organic muscle. So is it the right time that we can still do both, if you will. And most importantly, is it the right price, especially given where our depressed or undervalued stock price is, -- when you do the mathematics and say, well, okay, it's organic first. And on some of these inorganics, man, I'm better off buying shares. So I want to make sure everybody recognizes that all of those are on the table, organic investment, inorganic investment, share repos, but we run them through this filter to make sure that all of our decisions are maximizing shareholder value.

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America.

Matthew DeYoe
BofA Securities, Research Division

I'd also echo John's comments that congrats on the career and the retirement. I wanted to walk through some of the corporate cost inflation and bucket some of this stuff out across potential sources. I mean you're not the only Coatings company to talk about healthcare inflation, and I get that, but where is that coming in? And kind of related, does it make sense to align compensation fully to organic growth if there isn't commensurate EBIT accretion because it's helping the top line, but it also seems to exacerbate the headwinds from some of the other unabsorbed fixed costs.

Timothy Knavish
CEO & Chairman

Yes. Matt, I'll take this first, and then I'll let my short-timer CFO here take it from there. The leading answer here is medical claims in Q4, Vince will explain it. We're a pay-as-you-go company. They exceeded our expectations. The second piece is incentive comp. Now you got to remember, some of that is a year-over-year comp issue, right? Because we were drawn down our incentive comp accruals in Q4 of last year because of overall performance. And in this year, we were -- we had done the same, but then we came in stronger in Q4, much stronger in Q4 on 2 of our 3 metrics that guide our incentive payout -- our short-term incentive payout. It's an important point, the short term versus long term. I'll get to that in a second.

So our short-term incentives are based on 3 metrics: organic growth, EPS growth, and cash, cash flow. So on 2 of those 3, we finished better than expected. So that increases the payout. But a lot of that all came in Q4, so we had to catch up for the full year, right? So when you compare that to last year's comp, it looks like a big number. I want to reinforce, though, we are not overpaying ourselves or our team because the total payout is still less than target.

Now another point to your point about kind of how do you balance all these different metrics. If you look at the grand total compensation for our executives, including myself, the TSR payout, which is an important factor if you look through our proxy, that is not paying out. We have not performed there. The other one is on our restricted shares, we did not meet our EPS growth for that payout. So some of our longer-term payouts for the year will be significantly below target. But that kind of just explains how and why you see that delta in the Q4.

Vincent Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Matt, I'll just add to a good summary by Tim. The prior year, again, we lowered our Q4 incentive comp as we ended the year lower than we expected. And we came into Q4 this year, a strong fourth quarter, organic growth exceeded, strong cash flow, especially in the latter part of December in receivables, welcomed and our cash from ops was $500 million higher than the prior year.

As Tim mentioned, we did not hit our EPS target. So we are not getting the target payout for that. Flipping back to the medical. We are a company that's pay-as-you-go. We -- as I talk to my peers in the industry, we do see folks, we think, pulling some medical expenses into 2025 ahead of some potential inflation in 2026. So our medical costs year-over-year were up significantly in Q4 and particularly in December. So hopefully, that answers some of the questions you had on corporate expenses.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Sison with Wells Fargo.

Michael Sison
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

A couple of quick questions. On Architectural EMEA, that's a business that has struggled to grow, I mean, end markets, I understand. But why is that a good business for you all to keep longer term? And maybe what's the growth algorithm there? And maybe similar on Industrial Coatings. Again, I understand end markets have been tough, but how do you see those 2 businesses grow longer term? And then -- and just curious if Vince is going to take the [ Browns ] coaching job because I don't think anybody else wants it.

Vincent Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Let me answer that question first, Mike. I think that's a hopeless job. So I'm trying to retire, not go into a hopeless job.

Timothy Knavish
CEO & Chairman

I think he's already declined it officially, too. So Mike, the 2 answers to the 2 businesses you asked about are very different. One is an ongoing macro issue, and that's Architectural Europe. The other one is really kind of a tariff and time stamped issue, and that's general industrial. But let me talk about Architectural Europe. It's been a depressed volume market for years, as has much of the European economy. Two years ago, I guess, 3 years ago now, 2023, which was depressed, we generated record earnings and record cash that goes all the way back to 2008.

So even in depressed markets, we can generate good earnings and good cash, and we don't spend that cash within the business. We use that cash to supplement what we're trying to do in some of our higher growth businesses. What's happened in the last couple of years is the volume decline has been pretty pronounced. At this point last year, one of the things we missed, frankly, was we were projecting some upside in the market. We are not projecting upside in the market this year. We're saying flat, flattish for the whole year. But we're not waiting. We're not sitting around waiting for this macro to improve. It still makes good money for us. But with the actions we've started to take and will take throughout the year, we'll see margin expansion, cash generation expansion out of this business as we move through 2026. So it's not our best growth business, certainly, but it can deliver, has delivered good earnings, good cash in a challenging macro.

Vincent Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Before Tim goes on to industrial, Mike, I just want to remind everybody that this is a maintenance cycle business. We did have significant growth during COVID, so 2020, 2021. So the maintenance cycle clock reset. Typically, this is a 5- to 6-year maintenance window. So we're now getting to that fifth year where repaint typically would occur. So some of the volume declines in the past couple of years really have been because we pulled forward maintenance into those COVID years.

Timothy Knavish
CEO & Chairman

Yes. In Industrial, very different. It's a bit more cyclical than -- probably our most cyclical business is Auto. Second most will probably be our General Industrial because you're essentially painting big hunks of metal that get moved around the world. And so with the tariff uncertainty and what that's done to confidence of some of our customers, that's been dialed back and then what that's done from consumer affordability. So some of those folks are struggling.

But we do see sequential improvement in this business. What's interesting is we see really good sequential improvement in places like Europe and Latin America, largely driven by share gain. We see sequential improvement in things like heavy-duty equipment, not ag related, but construction related. We see some sequential improvements in transportation and powder and in a broad category of general finishes. But we still see challenges in the U.S. market, and we still see challenges in a small part of what we do in China is exported to the U.S., about 10% of what we do in China and think electronics and kitchen and bakeware, those kind of things remain depressed a bit.

So the industrial story is more of a timing one, and we are starting to see green shoots. We are starting to win share, and we'll start to launch those share wins as we move through 2026.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.

Jeffrey Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Your Performance Coatings revenue expectation for 2026 is flat to up low single digits. And in that segment, you've got Aerospace and you've got Auto Refinish. If Aerospace grows at a high single-digit rate in order to meet that guidance, Refinish has to contract at a high single-digit rate or a mid- to high-single-digit rate. Is that the correct conclusion to draw? And for Vince, how many shares did you buy back this quarter? And what did you spend?

Timothy Knavish
CEO & Chairman

Jeff, I'll take the first one. I don't think we're seeing that much of a decline, more like low to mid for Refinish in the first half. If you think sequentially, what did we see in Q3, Q4? We saw double digit, then we saw high single digit. So I'd say you ought to say that, that slope continued towards normalization as we move through the quarter.

Remember, I mean, traffic is quite small there, but we also have a nice PMC business in there that's not small that will contribute to some of the grand total of what we guided to for the year.

Vincent Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Jeff, for us, from a share repurchase perspective, we bought just under 980,000 shares at an average price of about $102. And we spent, as we said in the press release, around $100 million in the fourth quarter.

Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.

Ghansham Panjabi
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Vince, congrats from our team as well. I wish you the best in retirement. Just a quick one on raw materials -- sorry.

Vincent Morales
Senior VP & CFO

I'm still here till July, but thank you.

Ghansham Panjabi
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. I understand. Just an early congratulations. On the raw material side, as it relates to guidance, can you just give us a bit more color as to the constituents as you think about some of the major ones like TiO2, petros, et cetera, it looks like you're guiding flat for the year and also flat for the first quarter, but some of the spot markets were weaker into the fourth -- from the fourth quarter of 2025. So just curious as to which categories may be inflating as well?

Timothy Knavish
CEO & Chairman

Yes. So first, Ghansham and a public service announcement for everybody. This is not Vince's last earnings call, and I don't want Vince to think it's his last earnings call. He's still got 6 more months of work to do here. So -- but thank you for the kind words, and we'll have lots of kind words as we get closer to his actual date.

But Ghansham, high level, it's still a very long favorable to us supply-demand balance. So across the board, that generally means good pricing for us. But what offsets that, a couple of things. I put them in 3 categories. Epoxies are up a bit because of tariffs, right? And that's included in our guide. And that obviously affects more of the industrial businesses. So it doesn't affect Deco companies because most Deco products do not have epoxy. So when you compare to what others might say, the epoxies is one.

The second one is pigments, but let's not put TiO2 in that. I'd say more of the specialty pigments. We are seeing some inflation there driven by tariffs because those things come from all over the world, okay? And the other category that's up is metal packaging, and everybody knows what's happening on the aluminum and steel tariffs. Those are really the only categories that I can think of that are up in our guide. TiO2 is still pretty soft. Just given the supply/demand, we've been doing some supplier consolidation. We've been working volume commitment deals for pricing. So that one is still pretty soft. You know what oil is doing. So that drives solvents to be. And then across the board, everything else is still in a very long situation. Add it all together, and we come up with flat for Q1, flat for the year.

Vincent Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And I'll just remind everybody what we said at the outset, we do have targeted pricing that we institute either in the back half of 2025 or we'll institute in 2026, including in Q1. So we do expect higher pricing for 2026.

Your next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS.

Joshua Spector
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I just wanted to ask on Mexico. I don't know if there's a way you can maybe index your volumes for where you are today in fourth quarter versus a year ago? Because obviously, there's some easy comps in first half with all the liberation day disruptions. But it seems like the fourth quarter performance might say you're even above where you were coming into last year. So can you help us square that away a little bit, it would be helpful.

Timothy Knavish
CEO & Chairman

Yes. Let me give a high level, and then I'll let Vince give the details because he's doing the math in his head here. So we definitely finished pretty strong in Mexico. And if you look kind of sequentially at how we move through the year, we're down, call it, mid-single digits in Q1, up low single digits Q2, up mid-single digits Q3, up high single digits Q4. Now where that puts us relative to year-end '24, I'll give that to Vince.

Vincent Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Josh, if you look at the fourth quarter as a stand-alone basis, and again, there's 2 parts of our Mexican business. There's the retail or consumer segment. There's also the project segment. The retail segment has continued to grow. The project segment is the one that had contracted the most in the first half of the year. Fourth quarter over fourth quarter, just on the volume basis, we're right around mid-single digits higher. And again, some of that's recovery. And we expect, again, in the first quarter, a good volume based on an easier comp.

Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Favre with BNP.

Laurent Favre
BNP Paribas, Research Division

I want to go back to the, I guess, M&A discussion. I understand what you're saying on buybacks versus M&A. But there are some pretty obvious situations with assets coming out or potentially coming out of the recent announcements in Germany, Amsterdam and Philly. Now I think it's unlikely that we'll have any clarity before the second half of 2027. So am I right to assume that this might be a very quiet year for buybacks as you wait to get clarity on what's happening on those situations?

Timothy Knavish
CEO & Chairman

No. I wouldn't say that, Laurent. I would say, look, our balance sheet is strong enough that we've got optionality if something gets spit out of either of those 2 deals and if it makes sense to us at the right price, we've got optionality to do something there in 2027 without it impacting our ability to do buybacks in 2026. We're -- I think we're on 9 straight quarters of buybacks now. And we run a play, Vince, myself, our Treasurer and our corporate development guy sit down every quarter and say, what's the pipeline look like, what's cash flow look like, and we make a decision on buybacks. And we'll continue to do that because even if we make a buyback and then all of a sudden, I get a phone call saying, "Hey, there's something on the table here from one of these deals that's being spun out." I'm not worried about my ability to do both.

Tim, I hope you can understand some of the confusion we have regarding Vince's retirement date since many of us had already assumed that he was. So I appreciate your clarification there. I want to drill into a little bit about the first quarter here. In the script, I don't want to make too big a deal about it, but in the script, you described the first half as being low single-digit EPS growth. And in your comments this morning, you talked about it being flat to low single digits in the first half of the year.

Obviously, you didn't provide any 1Q guidance. Can you just speak to your expectations in terms of 1Q? I mean, I guess, flat, down, modestly up, all that's in the calculus as we sit here in late January.

Timothy Knavish
CEO & Chairman

Yes. Frank, by the way, I made that clarification not only for you, but I made that clarification [Technical Difficulty] fixed date. And I will publicly acknowledge it. You were right a year ago that Aaron Rodgers would be better with us than anything he could do with the Jets. So we'll leave that out there.

So look, here's the easiest way to say it. We're going to ramp up in our EPS growth. I said flat to low single digits for the first half. So I would interpret that as flattish for Q1, low single digit-ish for Q2 and then stronger in the second half of the year.

Michael Harrison

Tim, in response to one of the first questions you were asked on this call about organic growth and kind of what was running ahead of expectations, I was surprised to hear you not specifically mentioning China. It sounded a little bit like a specific, but it's ahead of expectations. Could you talk about what you're seeing in China and I guess in particular, what you see as we're kind of heading into the Lunar New Year and [Technical Difficulty]

Timothy Knavish
CEO & Chairman

Yes. Mike, I'm glad you asked that question because I want to clarify. I was responding by business, by vertical, not as much by geography. So I appreciate the opportunity to do that. Despite all the headlines, we're growing in China. We grew in Q4 in China and will grow in 2026 in China. It's because we have a strong position of local-for-local businesses. We're well positioned in the kind of the right industries.

But more broadly, Asia Pacific is very strong for us because India is doing great for us. Parts of Southeast Asia are doing great for us. So if you look at specifically China going forward, we'll see low single digits kind of growth, maybe mid-single digits kind of growth in 2026. So it's not the growth of a decade ago, but it's also not the gloom and doom that you see, at least for our portfolio because we're in the right places with the right kind of offering for the customers.

If you move to India, India has delivered double-digit growth for us throughout most of 2025. We expect that to continue into 2026. So part of that overall Asia Pacific story is China still putting up growth numbers, India contributing with double-digit growth numbers.

My question is back to Aero. I appreciate the intra-business mix breakdown as Aero becomes a bigger percentage of the segment. From a profitability and margin standpoint, how would you rank order Aero Coatings, Transparencies and Sealants? And then maybe also on customer mix, military versus G&A and commercial. And then I think you mentioned the OEM tailwinds, but how do you see the product mix for Transparencies and Sealants evolving in '26 and beyond?

Vincent Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Eric, this is Vince. As we've never done, we don't give our intra-business profitability by product or by end market. As Tim said in his opening remarks or in one of the Q&A questions, it's certainly one of our better performing businesses due to the technology and specification requirements. So -- but we're not going to give product-specific profitability.

Timothy Knavish
CEO & Chairman

Yes. As far as some of your other questions, mix of OEM, military and general aviation, I think we provided that pie chart and the growth rates among those 3 are very similar, which helps the portfolio. And to Vince's point, look, we're giving more detail on aerospace because we don't believe it's fully understood because we have a competitor that has a very -- I'll give them props. They've got a very good aerospace coatings business. This is much more than that. And as I said in my opening comments, coatings is actually the minority of our total profile here. So I don't know if I've addressed all your questions. I know you're particularly interested here because I believe you're a pilot or Air Force pilot -- so we'll be happy to show you how we make F-35 canopies someday or F-16 canopies. I'm not sure which bird you flew.

Vincent Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And if you look again, by end market, we do sell to OEM, we sell to military and general aviation. All those markets right now are sold out. All the products we have are sold out, hence the capital increase we've had the last couple of years. Also the operating expense increase as we have folks trying to debottleneck our existing operations. These operations are specified and qualified. So they do require significant handholding as we change processes.

Timothy Knavish
CEO & Chairman

Yes. And one more point, and then we can move on, but it's also significant R&D in this business. That's why we're able to command a better margin, better than the rest of -- or better than many parts of our portfolio because of the significant long-cycle R&D investment that it takes to win in this space.

James Hooper
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

My question is on auto OEM and the share gains there. Can you unpack a few more of the drivers for us, please? Is this to do with kind of your positioning in China? Or is it to do with your customers gaining share of the auto OEM market? And can you give us a little update about some of the technology offering there? Is that a driver of share gains?

Timothy Knavish
CEO & Chairman

Yes. Thank you, James. It's a little bit of all of those. I mentioned there is some element of customer mix there where one of our customers where we have a fairly large share of wallet had a rough couple of years. They're recovering now, and that helps us to some degree. But most of what we're winning on, we've been introducing lower cure products. We've got a new electric code product out there that is -- brings more productivity and some sustainability benefits to our customers.

We've been doing very well with automotive parts in that business. We've been doing well with particular large EV manufacturer based in China who, despite some headlines of what's happening to the EV market, is doing very well, both domestically and export, not to the U.S., obviously, but to many other countries. So it's a combination of some customer mix, some new technology wins and some, as Alicia, who runs the business for us calls it, targeting to win with the winners, partnering with those that are going to win in the marketplace and developing and bringing them their best value proposition and then growing with them.

Vincent Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. As we said all year, we did pick up some significant share in South America as one of our competitors exited the market. We realized the full quarterly benefit of that in Q4. We had some benefit in Q3, full quarterly benefit in Q4. That will carry over into the first half of 2026.

Timothy Knavish
CEO & Chairman

We've also got, as I said in my opening remarks, in addition to the carryover, there's another significant double-digit millions share wins that will launch throughout 2026 that we won in late 2025.

Patrick Cunningham

Just a quick one on Protective & Marine. You seem to call out normalization to industry growth rates. It seems like you still have some nice marine products that are ramping up. So are there any share losses offsetting in 2026? And what would you expect the overall industry growth rate to be across the platform?

Vincent Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Patrick, this is Vince. There are just really 2 factors there. Tim mentioned 11 consecutive quarters of volume growth, organic growth. That's compounding. So we're running up against some very difficult comparables. This is a project-oriented business. So as projects roll off, we have to win new projects. So those are 2 of the factors. We do feel good about our technology, as you mentioned, and that's going to continue to allow us to carry the day.

Timothy Knavish
CEO & Chairman

And you specifically mentioned Marine. Marine is a particular area of strength for us right now. We've been disproportionately winning in aftermarket of dry docks because of our SIGMAGLIDE technology. This year, we've also been disproportionately winning in Asia new builds. So marine continues to be a real strength for us as well then on the protective side, some of our specialty fireproofing products.

Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.

Arun Viswanathan
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Congrats on the impending retirement, Vince. Great, great working with you over the last several years. So I guess, first off, just wanted to dig back into the operating leverage and corporate expense question. So it looks like you're guiding to about 4% EPS growth. If I back into it, it looks like about 3% EBITDA growth. And as you show on the slide, flat to low single-digit up organic growth. So I think you mentioned price would be slightly positive. So that would kind of imply flattish to maybe even slightly down volumes. Is that correct?

And then I guess, as a follow-on, is it really that volume number that we need to see go higher that would drive the operating leverage? Or are the corporate expenses going to be structurally higher and kind of mute that in the foreseeable future? How do we kind of get to the point where you do see kind of a lot of the fruits of your labor paying off and you see that actual EPS growth come through?

Timothy Knavish
CEO & Chairman

Yes. Thanks, Arun. I'll take it first, Vince will fill in the details. First, we're not seeing structural change in our corporate expense going on, right? That's going forward. Vince will explain that. The biggest issue with our lack of leverage with the volume growth that we're getting today is first, second and third, the Refinish destocking because it's just such a strong margin for us that a lot of the other gains until that stabilizes, and you'll see it in the second half of the year as normalization happens there.

But that's like kind of #1, #2 and #3 is the reasons why you're not seeing more leverage. We'll continue to gain incremental volume going forward, and that will bring incremental leverage. Pricing will bring incremental leverage. We've got the cost outs, which will continue bringing incremental leverage. And in the second half of 2025, all those happen, but they got overshadowed by 2 things: one, the Refinish destocking; and two, corporate interest. So with that, let me throw it to Vince and fill in the details.

Vincent Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, if you look at 2026 versus 2025, a couple -- the segments are going to grow mid-single digits or higher in aggregate in terms of segment earnings. We do have higher interest costs, like most companies, we have some very low-cost debt rolling off. We had 3 maturities, 2 maturities in 2025 roll off. We have another maturity in early '26 roll off. We're replacing that in kind in absolute dollars, but not at the same interest rate.

So unfortunately, our interest costs are higher in '26 versus '25. In addition, and most companies are also seeing this, we're seeing a slight increase in our tax rate, and that's driven around a variety of different factors, especially in different jurisdictions. So those 2 items are a bit of a detractor, but the segment results, we are seeing growth year-over-year in 2026.

Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies LLC.

Laurence Alexander
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Just 2 quick ones. First, on the AI investments, given it's -- you're leveraging internal projects, do you have enough data to see what your paybacks are like on incremental investments? And secondly, on the share gains in industrial, do you expect those to be pro or contracyclical? If demand accelerates, do you expect the rate of share gain to accelerate?

Timothy Knavish
CEO & Chairman

Yes, Laurence, let me take both and Vince can fill in anything. The AI -- so first of all, it's still early days, right? We are -- yes, part of our increase in operating expense and capital expense is because of the AI. We've got a few runs on the board that have delivered millions to the bottom line, not yet material to the company, but very favorable early indicators relative to the investments that we made that this will be a very good ROI for us as we go forward. And you consider the fact that we've -- only [ AI CoE ] optimized 50 formulas that are commercialized so far, and we've only launched one that was AI developed so far. And if you look at the size of our pipeline, the materiality is yet to come.

But even today, we are booking savings to the bottom line with what's already been launched. So very confident in the ROI going forward.

Vincent Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. On the industrial side, Laurence, we would expect our share gains to be additive if there's a cyclical recovery here. As Tim mentioned earlier, this is one of our early warning businesses, both up and down, kind of the canary in the coal mine. We have seen in past and expect at some point green shoots in this business. And then with our share gains and technology offerings on top of that, we'd expect it to be additive.
