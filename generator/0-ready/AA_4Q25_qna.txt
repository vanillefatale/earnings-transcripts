Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Nick Giles with B. Riley.

Nick Giles
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. My first question was really when compared to the initial guidance, 2025 aluminum production in shipments did come in below initial expectations. And obviously, you've made a lot of progress at certain assets here more recently. But if we take a step back, what ultimately gives you the confidence that 2026 is attainable and could this be a year of upward revisions rather than downward?

William Oplinger
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Nick. We think the 2026 guidance is very much attainable. It's going to be based on how some of the restarts around the system go. We're in the process of restarting San Ciprián, we're still working on the restart of São Luís and overall, as you mentioned, we had extremely strong production at 5 of the smelters around the world, and we're confident that we can continue that progress that we had in 2025.

Nick Giles
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

That's great to hear, I appreciate that. My second question was Atlantic alumina received a fairly sizable investment from the DOW and other parties related to increasing alumina and gallium production. And so I was hoping to get your perspective on, one, domestic supply of alumina, is this something that Alcoa would ever be interested?

And then the second part on the gallium side, I didn't -- I don't think I heard any updates on the potential project in WA. I didn't know if there was anything -- any color you could provide there.

William Oplinger
President, CEO & Director

So as far as the first part of the question, alumina is largely fungible, and therefore, our 2 sites in the U.S. would certainly consider a U.S.-based supply of alumina as long as it cut down on transportation costs. So if that excess capacity comes online, we will certainly look at opportunities to use it in the U.S.

As far as our gallium project is going, we're making progress. We're continuing to work with the 3 governments to ensure that we can build a really strong gallium plant at the end of Wagerup. And so we are making progress on the project and are moving forward.

The next question is from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley.

Carlos de Alba
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

My first question is regarding the alumina profitability. Clearly, prices are under pressure, maybe at the bottom, depending on how things play out. But the profitability for that business unit or that segment for you guys, has come down. Based on the guidance, probably it's going to be breakeven, give or take. So what -- can you talk about what the plans are to potentially come out with initiatives to reduce cost, if possible, improve productivity, efficiencies just to enhance the profitability of that segment?

William Oplinger
President, CEO & Director

So I'll address it. And if, Molly, if you want to add anything. Clearly, we understand where we are in the cycle in alumina. And we've shown in the past, Carlos, that we can get pretty aggressive around costs. Now what we won't do this time around is really put any of our plants in jeopardy for the future. And we have a low-cost position on the cost curve, and there are other plants around the world, specifically in China, who are much higher on the cost curve. So they will be under pressure. Their margins will be under significant pressure at these levels.

Carlos de Alba
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

All right. And then maybe on the idle sites or monetization of idle sites, could you provide maybe a little bit more color? We're expecting something to be announced maybe by the end of last year or the first quarter, it seems now that progress has been made, but more to be -- or expected to be done concluded in the first half of the year. Any additional color that you can provide in addition to your comments, is it one side, two sides? Anything that you can help us with, obviously, it's a very important aspect of the company.

Molly Beerman
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks for the question, Carlos. The negotiations for the primary site that we're working on now, it's taking longer because it is not a simple land sale. This particular negotiation could involve a multiyear payment stream as well as some value sharing structures. And we're going to take our time and get this right, make sure we get the most value. So that's the slight extension on the timing there. We are continuing to progress several other sites. We have 10 priority sites in total to meet our target of $500 million to $1 billion over the next 5 years.

Operator

The next question is from Katja Jancic with BMO Capital Markets.

Katja Jancic
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Can you provide the update on the current status of Alumar smelter?

William Oplinger
President, CEO & Director

Yes. The Alumar smelter had a setback again in the fourth quarter. We would anticipate that the production level in the first quarter will be very similar to what we had in the fourth quarter. The issue that we had in the fourth quarter that was really initiated by a series of power interruptions that occurred and the stability of that plant is not in a position where it was able to absorb those changes in power but we do anticipate that the first quarter should not be materially different than the fourth.

Molly Beerman
Executive VP & CFO

I'll just add that we did reach profitability at the smelter in the second half of the year. And again, the production change will not be significantly different sequentially. And in '26, we'll continue with the stabilization efforts there and work on our cost improvement programs.

Katja Jancic
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

And then maybe shifting to San Ciprián, given the current alumina and aluminum environment, if the operations would be at full capacity, would the operations generate -- would the EBITDA be positive?

Molly Beerman
Executive VP & CFO

For the smelter, we will reach profitability after we complete the restart, and that is still on track for the middle of 2026. The pricing is very favorable there. We're still working on our overall program for the complex, and I can give you an update on our EBITDA guidance for '26 for the combined smelter and refinery. So we have an EBITDA loss of approximately $75 million to $100 million. The majority of that is the refinery. Our free cash flow consumption will be approximately $100 million to $130 million and that includes refinery CapEx of about $50 million. We are making some working capital improvements across the sites. We have the benefit of that as well.

We are still progressing on our plan to reach cash neutrality in 2027. 2026, as we indicated during our Investor Day, commentary will be challenged, though with the numbers that I just gave you. In Spain, we do not record the CO2 compensation until it is earned. And recall there's a 3-year clawback so we will have cash receipt of about $85 million coming in, in the second half of '27 for our '26 production. So that's why we still have confidence that by the second half of '27, we will have reached our neutrality goal. We will have smelter profitability, we'll have the CO2 payment coming in, and that will completely cover refinery losses at that point.

The next question is from Daniel Major with UBS. Major your line is open on our end, perhaps it's muted on yours.

Moving on to the next question is from Glyn Lawcock with Barrenjoey.

Glyn Lawcock
Barrenjoey Markets Pty Limited, Research Division

You mentioned in today's release, a back-to-back mine move in WA, could you just sort of maybe talk a little bit to that, when does that start to -- when do you have to submit your permit request for that second mine move? And how should I think about that relative to the one that's currently underway?

Molly Beerman
Executive VP & CFO

Glyn, we'll probably have to recheck that. I don't believe we said back-to-back on the mine moves in today's release.

William Oplinger
President, CEO & Director

And if we were to give you an update, Glyn, on the current mine move, we're progressing well. We are -- we've responded to the submissions that were made in the public comment period. We still anticipate the EPA making the recommendation by the end of the first half and we still anticipate having our permits by the end of 2026.

Glyn Lawcock
Barrenjoey Markets Pty Limited, Research Division

Okay. That's great. And then maybe just -- I don't know if you mentioned it, but just the Canada tariff exemption, I mean, obviously, how long is a piece of string, but just any updates on discussions there? Or is it still something too hard to call?

William Oplinger
President, CEO & Director

I think it's very hard to call with all the geopolitical changes that are going on around the world, Glyn, it's difficult to say whether there will be a Canadian exemption. Midwest premium obviously has risen to cover the total tariff expense. As a company, we're probably spending over $1 billion in gross tariff expense on an annual basis, but the Midwest premium is high enough to cover that. So the tariffs in their entirety are getting passed on to customers at this point.

The next question is from Lawson Winder with Bank of America.

Lawson Winder
BofA Securities, Research Division

Can I ask about the productivity improvements at alumina that you cited driving the higher production? Which kind of jumped out just because of Kwinana being down. Is that better utilization? Are you getting some higher third-party bauxite? or are there other factors that are driving that?

Molly Beerman
Executive VP & CFO

Lawson, I would say most of that is just simply because the teams there are really applying every technical resource to continue to improve productivity with the low bauxite grade. So we're not seeing improvements in the grade. The teams just continue to do a great job of increasing production.

William Oplinger
President, CEO & Director

So if you go around the system and some of this relates to the end of 2025 going into 2026, the Alumar refinery is running extremely well, and we're seeing great production out of the Alumar refinery. The San Ciprián refinery is held at around 2,100 tonnes per day and there's a variety of different reasons for why we're holding it at 2,100 tonnes a day, it doesn't make -- in this price environment it doesn't make any sense to ramp it up any higher.

And then if you go to WA, both Pinjarra and Wagerup had good years. We think that they're going to have better years in 2026. And they are reacting well to the lower bauxite grade and we believe that they will outperform in 2026.

Lawson Winder
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. And can I also get your thoughts on capital return? So congratulations on achieving a net debt level below the $1.5 billion target, you suggested that, that might rise -- the net debt might rise back above the $1.5 billion target in Q1, I mean, TBD. But then thinking beyond Q1, how does that net debt level factor into your thinking around potential buybacks? I mean, is there a certain comfort level below the $1.5 billion that might put capital return back on the table or for 2026, should we maybe think about net continued debt repayment and then potential investment opportunities in growth for the business rather than capital return?

Molly Beerman
Executive VP & CFO

So we did just get under the target at $1.46 billion. So again, as we said in our comments, our goal is not only to stay with -- to get to the range, but to stay within it throughout our cycles. And as we mentioned, we're going to consume cash in the first quarter that will be related to both working capital and tax payments. We do expect to generate cash across 2026 and that will be used for additional debt repayments. Recall, we still have $219 million on our 2028 notes, and we will expect to have excess cash to compete between shareholder returns and value-creating growth opportunities.

William Oplinger
President, CEO & Director

If I would just add to that, it all starts with a rock solid balance sheet, and we are now within our target range, but a fundamental belief on our part is that one of the strengths of our company is that we need to have a fortress balance sheet and we're within the range. Beyond that, we have the sustaining capital that we'll spend to sustain the cash flow that we get from the operations. And then as Molly said extremely well, it's going to be a mix between returns to shareholders and growth.

The next question is from Timna Tanners with Wells Fargo.

Timna Tanners
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to ask, obviously, given the step change in aluminum prices, if you have any updated thoughts on volumes, especially in the U.S. and Europe? So the President Trump's mandate was to increase production. That was the design, I believe, of the test, and it hasn't been much. So is there pressure from the Trump administration? Any new thoughts on Warrick? And then, of course, in Europe, the CBAM mention is for prices, but also could be encouraging of domestic volumes. So your thoughts on volumes would be great.

William Oplinger
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So there's 4 smelters in the U.S. We own 2 of them. Massena is running flat out. And as you saw, we just signed a long-term power contract at Massena that gets us 10 more years plus an option for another 10. So very exciting that we can have competitive green power in Massena, but they don't have any further capacity available to them.

In Warrick, we have a line that is idle currently. The issue with restarting that line in Warrick is, number one, it's expensive. It costs us about $100 million. And depending on the availability of key -- lead time on key production items, for instance, transformers and things like that, it could take up to a couple of years to restart that smelter -- that line at the smelter. So it's, at this point, unlikely that we would restart the fourth line. I can't speak for anybody else in the U.S., Timna in what they're doing.

If we then look at Europe, I think that the incremental $40 that we talk about in the Rotterdam premium is highly unlikely to incent anyone to restart capacity in Europe. In Europe, it all comes down to, as it does anywhere around the world is energy. And what are energy prices doing? And last time I looked, energy is not getting significantly cheaper in Europe anytime soon.

Timna Tanners
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Helpful. If I could just -- one more on Spain circling back, if I recall from the Investor Day, you talked about a time frame where you'd be free to exit the country given your existing framework. Can you remind us when that is?

William Oplinger
President, CEO & Director

So we will have largely fulfilled the viability agreement by the end of 2027.

The next question is from Lachlan Shaw with UBS.

Lachlan Shaw
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Just a couple for me. So firstly, I just wanted to dig a little more into the Section 232 kind of tariff piece. Can I ask -- in a scenario where there is a preferential rate agreed at some point, what is your expectations for how the Midwest premium might react?

William Oplinger
President, CEO & Director

In theory, the Midwest premium, if there were a preferential tariff between Canada and the U.S., in theory, the Midwest premium should not fall and the reason why that is, is if all the metal from Canada were to continue to come into the U.S. or preferential tariff, you still need to incent metal to come from outside of North America. And so in theory, that should not fall. Now I keep reiterating in theory, it will -- it's hard to determine what the sentiment would look like. But we believe that the marginal ton still comes from outside of North America.

Lachlan Shaw
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And my second question, so you just gave a bit of color there in terms of the existing portfolio and potential optionality to restart. But if I sort of step back, look at the aluminum market, roll forward a year or two, trade seems likely to be tightening. When you look at the options around restarting versus buying versus building, I mean how are you seeing those sorts of trends right now? What sort of seems relatively more or less attractive in terms of if you were to pursue a growth agenda?

William Oplinger
President, CEO & Director

It really depends on what product line that you're looking at. So remember that we have 3 different product lines: bauxite, alumina and aluminum. At this point, we do not have greenfield expansion plans for aluminum, and we've not found anywhere around the world that provides a sufficiently low energy price for sufficient returns on a greenfield plant at this point. In the case of refining and bauxite is very similar, refining capital costs are still fairly high. And certainly, at today's prices, it makes it difficult for a greenfield expansion.

Now with that said, we do have brownfield opportunities to potentially grow in both mining, refining and smelting. But at this point, we don't have significant greenfield plans going forward.

The next question is from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan.

William Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Nice job on the quarterly execution. I might have missed it, but can you quantify the impact -- the EBITDA impact from San Ciprián restart specifically in the first quarter?

Molly Beerman
Executive VP & CFO

It was part of the $70 million guide down that we gave, $50 million of that related to the CO2 compensation, not repeating and the other $20 million is related to San Ciprián.

William Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. Okay. Yes, I thought it was about $15 million to $20 million. So that's helpful. And then the second question, I guess, on the Western Australia mine approvals. I guess is there any key milestones before the ministerial approvals by the end of 2026? Any particular deliverables from your side or actions to be taken? Anything notable to call out from the public comment period? Just trying to get a sense of what happens between now and the end of the year.

William Oplinger
President, CEO & Director

So the public comment period was extensive, and we received close to 60,000 comments. We've responded to all of those comments. The next major milestone in the process is that we should have a recommendation from the EPA at the end of the first half and then have ministerial approvals in the -- by the end of the year.

The next question is from John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research.

John Tumazos
John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC

Following up on the earlier question, what would be the earliest time table for a greenfield ELYSIS smelter? Assuming that the technology is progressing, and if you were to build a smelter, would the scale resemble some of the large Asian smelters such as Vedanta has a 1.6 million tons smaller?

William Oplinger
President, CEO & Director

So John, the earliest that we would implement at ELYSIS is not until after 2030. So we will not be implementing any ELYSIS technology between now and 2030. I can't speak for our partners. They may do something, but you'd have to talk to them.

As far as a competitive global greenfield smelter, there really are only a few technology providers around. One is the Chinese and the other is the Emirates. And they typically come in sizes of around 500,000 to 600,000 tons. So you can scale from that between 500,000 and 600,000 tons. But if a new greenfield were to come online, I would anticipate it to be in that size range.

John Tumazos
John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC

So when you use the word implement, is that groundbreaking or completion?

William Oplinger
President, CEO & Director

That's groundbreaking. So we're not looking to do anything with ELYSIS this decade yet, and we would do groundbreaking. If we do an ELYSIS smelter and I say if because there's still a lot of water to go under the bridge as far as research and development analysis. But if we were to do that, it would be groundbreaking post 2030.

The next question is from Daniel Major with UBS.

Daniel Major
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So yes, a couple of questions. Just first, following up specifically on the CO2 compensation accounting and the accrual in the fourth quarter. I think Norsk Hydro accrues through the P&L during the year with their CO2 compensation and then has a cash adjustment in 4Q. Is this a recurring item? So next 4Q '26, you would also book through the P&L essentially one-off recognition of the CO2 compensation. And would it be around the same quantum this time next year?

Molly Beerman
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Dan, the -- so in the past, we accrued full CO2 compensation. However, when the government applied the conditional portion, we had to go through and apply for our projects and spend that would qualify on those carbon and emission reduction measures. So we just received that feedback and it allowed us to take a position on some of the R&D that we had spent. So we took that credit. I expect going forward, we will make those decisions more regularly because we now have feedback on our group of projects that have qualified. That's why we indicated it will not recur to the same level in the first quarter of '26.

Daniel Major
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So it isn't -- it doesn't reflect an annual fourth quarter recognition. It's just one this year and won't recur at any point in the future as far as you see it?

Molly Beerman
Executive VP & CFO

It won't recur as kind of a callout item. It will be more regular coming into '26. We actually -- with the projects that we submitted, some of them are CapEx and then we had a piece of R&D. The CapEx was more forward-looking. So that will apply in the future. We can use those credits against CapEx. This year, we used it against R&D because we had qualifying expenditures in the current year. You can also carry over those conditional credits. So it may not be exactly the same amount every year. It really does depend on your qualifying spend in the year.

Daniel Major
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. And sorry, just a follow-up on this topic. I don't believe you highlighted it in the Q3 outlook as a one-off. Does that mean it's kind of an incremental positive relative to what you guided?

Molly Beerman
Executive VP & CFO

We didn't call it out because we honestly thought it would be a bit less than what we ended up qualifying for. So we have, I would say, the majority of it, maybe half of it in the outlook, embedded and we didn't discuss it, but we ended up with more than -- more qualifying expenditures than we had expected.

Daniel Major
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Got it. Okay. Thanks for clarifying that. And then just a second one if I might follow up on the commentary you made around the legacy site you've got in negotiation and expect to close it in the first half of '26. Can you give us any sense of how much of the guided proceeds might be from that divestment in the range?

Molly Beerman
Executive VP & CFO

We're going to hold around until we close the deal. Again, these arrangements are a bit more complicated than what we're used to working on in the past, and they come in installments. So we're going to hold that news until we get there.

This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Oplinger for any closing remarks.
