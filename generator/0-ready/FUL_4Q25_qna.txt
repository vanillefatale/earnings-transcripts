[Operator Instructions] your first question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners.

Michael Harrison
Seaport Research Partners

Congrats on a nice finish to the year. I was hoping we could start with the Q1 guidance. You mentioned a couple of times that you feel good about the momentum that you finished the year with. But for Q1, you're kind of pointing to a low single-digit top line decline. I think FX is a pretty good tailwind. So maybe we're thinking more like mid-single-digit organic sales decline.

Maybe just give us a little bit more color on what you think would be driving that weakness. And I'm curious if you can comment at all on what December looked like and if that's informing some of the weaker outlook.

Celeste Mastin
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So what we'll see going into Q1 will be continued performance much like we saw in the fourth quarter of this year. I mean if you look at volume progression throughout Q4, what you would see is that EA was strengthening throughout the quarter. BAS was improving, but it's still weak. And in Q4, we had a pretty tough comp there of plus 7%. And it's going to be a continually challenging environment for HHC. What we saw at the end of the year was just a step down the last couple of months, particularly by the CPG customers in their order patterns. So we'll probably get a little more of an uplift there.

That said, the biggest impact in Q1, Mike, is going to be Chinese New Year. So the timing of Chinese New Year in Q1 will result in some of that revenue being pushed into Q2. I don't know if you want to comment further, John.

John Corkrean
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. Yes. Sure, Mike. That's the big -- that's the primary reason Q1 looks a little weaker is the timing of Chinese New Year. In 2025, it was late January, early February. And in 2026, it's late February stretching into March. And revenue declines to almost nothing during Chinese New Year and then bounces back very strong after the holiday. So last year, we saw that bounce back in Q1. This year, it will happen in Q2. Because of this, we'll see 1 to 2 weeks of revenue move from Q1 to Q2, probably has a revenue impact of $15 million to $20 million, and EBITDA impact of $6 million to $8 million. So it's really just a shift between Q1 and Q2.

You had asked about December or how we're seeing revenue so far and whether that's a reason we have had a little softer guidance. No. I mean, it's really Chinese New Year. I'd say the year started out basically as expected. Things are a little weird in December with the timing of the holidays. But if we look at the first 6 weeks or so, it's tracking with what we'd expect and what we -- and so the impact of Chinese New Year is to come, but we believe that, that will push some revenue into Q2.

Michael Harrison
Seaport Research Partners

Understood. And then, just wanted to ask another one on raw 1materials. In fiscal '25, you started the year with a little bit of raw material versus pricing headwind, and I think that got better as the year progressed.

How are you thinking about raw materials and pricing in fiscal '26? And I'm just curious kind of what that means for the year-over-year comparison on margins. Is the assumption that pricing versus raws is kind of slightly positive all year? Or is it maybe more of a tailwind in the first half and turning into more of a headwind or more neutral in the second half? Any kind of thoughts on that cadence would be helpful.

Celeste Mastin
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So in 2025, we delivered around $30 million of combined price and raw material benefit. As we mentioned in the last quarter, we anticipate seeing a carryover benefit of around $25 million into 2026, plus our continued efforts to reallocate sourcing to drive pricing to drive our business towards the highest margin, most differentiated spaces has led us to increase that benefit of price and raws in 2026 to about $35 million. So that will be the year-over-year comparison you're going to see, Mike.

John Corkrean
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And I think in terms of timing, maybe slightly weighted to the first half of the year, but we will see, I'd say, a favorable spread for the entire year because we will get additional new pricing in 2026.

Celeste Mastin
President, CEO & Director

Yes, you'll see expanded margins in all GBUs in the second -- in 2026, much like we delivered this year.

Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird.

Ghansham Panjabi
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Maybe we can focus on the BAS segment and some of the drivers that impacted your 4Q and there was a lot going on in the quarter with, obviously, the government shutdown, et cetera. Just curious as to whether it had any impact on you? And specific to that, if it did, was there any change in trajectory December onwards?

Celeste Mastin
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We had a tough comp in the fourth quarter for BAS. Ghansham was plus 7% in Q4 of '24 for the overall BAS business. So there's a few things going on there. One is we're wrapping around some -- a big customer win from 2024. So that's one thing you saw as an impact in Q4. We continue to be successful serving data centers, also LNG. But overall, the construction environment continues to weaken. That said, there's some pretty exciting things going on in BAS. I'm really thrilled to be taking a bigger position in LNG. We just won a big project on [ CP2 ] with our Foster's product. which is used for cryogenic insulation systems. So we're going to continue to see as that capacity expansion happens around the globe, and it's growing at about 7% in LNG, we're going to continue to see wins there.

Also, we just started shipping a data center, a big data center ultimately, that will be 4 million square feet at conclusion in Texas in fourth quarter. So more exciting stuff there. And also, I mean, our glass business continues to succeed. Our 4SG product grew 18% in 2025 despite a reduction of housing starts of 6%. So none of those businesses are really affected by the government shutdown. So I would take that off the table for us. I would just say tough comp wrap around on new customer business and a generally tough construction environment.

Ghansham Panjabi
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Got it. And then for packaging, as it relates to HHC, you called that out as weaker. Anything going on there relative to the recent trend line apart from customers just managing inventory aggressively into year-end, et cetera? And then also on fiscal year '26 guidance, I'm sorry if I missed this, but can you give us a sense as to core sales by segment? I know you're guiding towards roughly flat for the year.

Celeste Mastin
President, CEO & Director

Sure. So on packaging drivers, we're seeing really just in North America, in particular, weakness from our packaging and related CPG customers. So again, we saw a very similar trend to what we saw last year with just kind of ongoing slightly negative volume in that space that really took a step down in P11 and P12. And I think that's a space that's just going to continue to be challenging for us throughout HHC in general throughout the course of the next year. It's a -- given the issues with affordability and the lack of mobility, people aren't really moving. There's not a lot of household formation. That is weighing on that business. But we continue to introduce some exciting innovations there.

The HHC business grew very well in not Europe, but in EIMEA. So in our EIMEA sector -- we took a lot of share in places like Algeria and Turkey because we're being able to -- we're more able to produce successfully out of our new Cairo facility. So that's been exciting. We're growing in India in that business. So HHC is migrating to growth in higher growth developing nations. And again, our plant strategy revolves around making sure we can produce cost effectively in places like that to take advantage of the trend. Also in Asia Pacific, we had growth in our packaging business. This is related to just this recurrence and the bounce back in China that we're seeing, and we've introduced some new innovations in packaging related to anti-slip coatings in Asia that helped support and grow our business there. The business in HHC was pretty strong in packaging in Asia. And so it's a balanced story if you look around the globe, and we're migrating the business to really focus on the places where we know we can be successful and building the supporting infrastructure within the company to do that.

Now your second question was -- I think it was core sales by segment?

John Corkrean
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And I can take that, Ghansham, just we'll try to unpack our revenue guidance here just a little bit. So we said that we expect revenue to be flat to up 2%, that organic revenue will be flattish. So the difference there really being FX. So we do expect about one point of favorability for the full year from FX if rates stay where they are. Acquisitions really won't have a meaningful impact, at least not the ones we've done so far because the carryover is very small.

So what it implies is organic revenue might be up slightly, down slightly. We expect pricing to be positive in all 3 GBUs, probably 0.5% to 1% positive. And then if you look at the GBUs in terms of kind of volume, we'd expect EA to deliver positive volume growth despite the headwind from solar. We'd expect HHC and BAS probably to be down slightly year-on-year. So does that help?

Ghansham Panjabi
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes, it does. It does. Very comprehensive.

Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.

Kevin McCarthy
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

John, I was wondering if you could speak to your free cash flow outlook for 2026. Your capital expenditure budget looked to be on par with what we would have expected, but the cash flow from operations may be a little bit lighter than we would have thought. So is there anything in particular you would call out that might be weighing on the free cash flow conversion in terms of working capital or any other extraordinary cash needs?

John Corkrean
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So I'd say if you look at cash flow from operations, Kevin, we guided to $275 million to $300 million versus $263 million this year. So it's the midpoint, roughly $25 million increase, which is driven almost entirely by higher income. Working capital, we would expect to be similar. So I would say if you look at kind of the last couple of years, operating cash flow has been weighed down a little bit by working capital. And we mentioned at the Investor Day that we are going to carry higher inventory as we get through Quantum Leap. So I would say that's the primary picture. If you think about free cash flow, it's CapEx sort of in line with what we have been talking to and operating cash flow driven by income and working capital remaining a little higher in the near term.

Kevin McCarthy
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Very good. And then on your EBITDA outlook, I heard the comments on the Chinese New Year timing, which was very helpful. But I was wondering if you could just expand on the key assumptions that you're baking into the annual guide and just trying to get a feel for what sort of macro help, if any, you might need to achieve the earnings targets.

Celeste Mastin
President, CEO & Director

So on the -- I'll take the first question about the macro help. Kevin, we're expecting no macro help. We've built in a strong self-help approach to the year, much like we had to do last year. So while we think we'll be positive pricing in all of our GBUs, and there's clearly a focus on that as we continue to refine and select which parts of the business we want to operate in. But also on the volume side, we're not expecting any positive macro to be supportive there. We're going to have to get there a different way or we're prepared to get there a different way. Maybe there'll be positive surprises around volume that will help.

John Corkrean
Executive VP & CFO

And just to maybe give you the key building blocks of kind of the guidance for EBITDA for 2026 relative to 2025. Celeste mentioned the impact of -- net impact of pricing and raws, we expect to get about a $35 million improvement year-on-year. FX, again, based on where exchange rates are today, would be a $5 million to $10 million benefit.

Quantum Leap, as we talked about, will continue to ramp up. We expect about $10 million of incremental savings in 2026 versus 2025. And then going the other way, we have about $10 million of variable comp rebuild based on where we finished 2025. So we'll have about $10 million of incremental variable comp expense in 2026 and about $20 million of wage and other inflation. So I think those are the key building blocks. And as Celeste said, volume, we've expected to be relatively neutral, but that could be the swing item one way or the other.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.

Jeffrey Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

When I look at your other income adjusted in the fourth quarter, it looked like it's a little bit more than $10 million. And you spoke of an insurance payment. How much was that? Or what's going on in other income? And other income for the year adjusted was a little bit more than $30 million. And last year, it was $17 million. Can you talk about those numbers?

John Corkrean
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Jeff. So there's 2 items that are kind of driving that. The primary ones are higher pension income year-on-year. So that's probably half of that difference. So the pension assets earning higher returns generate more pension income. The second part of it is FX hedging gains or losses. I think we've done a really good job this year in managing that and reduce that impact significantly through, I'd say, both part of its cooperation in the market, cost of hedging come down a little bit, but I think we've managed it well and reduced any potential leakage from a hedging standpoint. So those are the 2 main items driving that year-on-year improvement.

Jeffrey Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Your deferred taxes were a use of $50 million versus $36 million last year. Can you talk about what's going on there? And your accounts payable was down about $20 million year-over-year. What's going on there?

John Corkrean
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So on deferred taxes, the biggest impact there is we did pull a pretty big dividend from China in 2024 that comes with a withholding tax. So we were able to bring a little over $100 million of cash back from China, has about a 15% withholding tax. So that -- although we declared the dividend in 2024 the withholding tax was paid in 2025. So that was the impact on the deferred tax line.

On the trade payables line, it is -- it does have a big year-on-year swing. I think this is kind of a reflection also of timing on inventory. But it's -- I would say, overall, our level of payables, our payables as a percentage of revenue are very similar year-on-year. I think what we saw in 2024 is a big improvement and then it leveled off and maybe DPO came down a little bit in 2025.

Jeffrey Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And then lastly, is there an incremental penalty because of weakness in the solar market in 2026? And do you expect 2026 to be a meaningful acquisition year?

Celeste Mastin
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I'll take that one. So as far as solar goes, Jeff, in 2025, we had about $80 million of revenue in the solar business. What we're going to see is that's going to ramp down to around $50 million by the conclusion of this year. So over the course of the year, you're going to see predominantly in the first 3 quarters, a reduction of about $30 million of revenue related to that exit of that one particular product in solar that we're deemphasizing.

As far as 2026 being a meaningful acquisition year, we definitely have a very full pipeline as we curtailed acquisitions for the last 3 quarters of 2025 in order to bring our leverage down. We ended the year at 3.1x. As you saw, we're still not quite in our $2.5 million to $3 million -- or 2.5 to 3x levered range. So we're still being cautious. But again, the pipeline is full, and we are very selectively working through it at this point in time. So you should expect the acquisition cadence in 2026 to be more like a normal year for us. So back up to that roughly $200 million to $250 million of purchase price spend.

Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citigroup.

Patrick Cunningham
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I was hoping you could just dig into sort of the level of confidence in the volume growth in EA 2026, maybe ex solar. I guess, do you expect any normalization of what has been pretty consistently strong outperformance in autos and electronics in '25? Or do you feel like you have a good line of sight in terms of both market growth and new business?

Celeste Mastin
President, CEO & Director

I do feel like we have a good line of sight there. And this EA team has just been unleashed. So as you saw, excluding solar, about 7% organic growth in the fourth quarter, 5% volume growth. And I anticipate we're going to be able to continue to drive that, excluding solar over time. I mean, look at our ND acquisition -- ND Industries acquisition, for example. We brought that business in, in 2024. If you look at 2025, we had it operating at 8% organic growth. So that is a team that understands how to grow the business. We do have this overhang of the solar business that we're deemphasizing that they're going to have to contend with a $30 million hit over the course of 2026. But aside from that, the electronics, the aerospace and especially the automotive market are growing very successfully.

I mean just looking at the automotive business that we have in Asia -- we continue to grow our position in interior trim significantly, but also we grew our position in exterior trim well over 100% last year. Our lighting business grew about 50%. Our EV powertrain business grew over 40% in that region in 2025. And they're really in a position where they have taken a strong share position in the market, and we are strong partners generating innovation along with our customers and an important part of their new product development pipeline. So yes, we're very confident about EA.

Patrick Cunningham
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's very helpful. And I wanted to come back to free cash flow. Obviously, conversions, another year below historic averages. I guess, how should we think about long-term free cash flow conversion? And then maybe what should we expect in terms of peak working capital drag and peak CapEx drag associated with Quantum Leap?

John Corkrean
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. So Patrick, I would say if we think about kind of what we talked about at Investor Day, we would expect that operating cash flow will remain a little muted here in the next couple of years, primarily due to higher working capital associated with Quantum Leap. I think we finished this year at working capital of 15.8% as a percentage of revenue. Our goal is to be below 15%. I would expect that we'll be above 15% this year and possibly in 2027. But our ultimate goal is to get below that.

The other benefits we'll see from a working capital standpoint as we complete Quantum Leap by reducing the number of facilities we have, we should be able to take out CapEx related to maintenance capital. So we expected, as we said at Investor Day, maintenance capital, which is roughly $50 million annually, we expect we could eliminate as much as 1/3 of that. We'll also be completing our SAP implementation at the end of this year. And so that's roughly $20 million of capital that we spend every year that should be reduced dramatically. From a working capital standpoint, as it relates to these initiatives, we talked about the Quantum Leap initiative and how we see that improving inventory management and days on hand by roughly 5 days, which I think is about $15 million.

So I do think we'll probably be a little bit lighter from a free cash flow standpoint the next couple of years as we have slightly elevated CapEx and slightly higher working capital related to Quantum Leap. We get through Quantum Leap and the SAP implementation. I think we should see a nice step up.

Your next question comes from the line of Lucas Beaumont with UBS.

Lucas Beaumont
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I just wanted to go back to the organic growth outlook, if we could. So I mean it looks like first quarter is going to kind of be down low single digits. I assume maybe second quarter is potentially flattish with the benefit of the shift there on Chinese New Year. So I mean, to get to kind of flat for the year, you probably need the second half to kind of be up low single digits there. So I was just wondering if you could kind of walk us through kind of where you see the acceleration coming from across the portfolio to drive that.

Celeste Mastin
President, CEO & Director

Yes. When -- if you look at -- maybe I'll start, and John, you might want to jump in here, too. But if you look at it from the perspective of 2026 overall, Lucas -- and by the way, welcome. If you look at it from the perspective of 2026 overall, what you should expect will be EA performing organically kind of mid-single digits, excluding solar, low single digits, up low single digits, including the solar business. Meanwhile, the BAS and the HHC business are going to be slightly down. Now all of our businesses, all our GBUs will be positive price 2026. So that means correspondingly, that's going to be largely a volume impact.

John Corkrean
Executive VP & CFO

And I think your question, Lucas, around second half versus first half, I think the biggest driver is probably the fact we'll have mostly annualized against the solar decline by the second half, right? So we're kind of up against that the first half, particularly the first quarter becomes less of a headwind, almost no headwind by the second half, fourth quarter. So that's the primary difference.

Lucas Beaumont
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Great. And then I guess just on the pricing side. So I mean, you mentioned that's going to kind of be in the 50 to 100 basis point range. I mean you're exiting 4Q at a bit over 1%. And I mean it's continued to increase. We're going to kind of have some tougher comps there as we sort of get through the year. And I know there's the continued sort of backdrop of raw materials deflation.

So I guess just kind of walk us through how you sort of see that slowing. I mean you mentioned that you're going to kind of potentially go out with some more price too. So I guess, as we move through the year, I guess, how much do you think you can kind of hold that in there with the new initiatives that you've been undertaking?

Celeste Mastin
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So the pricing cadence, it is influenced by our pricing actions that we'll be taking throughout the course of the year. And those vary depending on the business unit, the market segment and actually ultimately what's happening in a region or a segment at any given point in time. But you do see more of those happen historically earlier in the year. The biggest impact on just our ability to retain pricing and drive pricing throughout the year is just a couple -- it's twofold. One is portfolio mix. So we do continue to optimize the business to be operating in the more differentiated, more solution-oriented spaces in our markets. And the companies we're acquiring are just that.

So there's a portfolio mix impact that you also see that does filter down to pricing and also just a cultural shift as we at H.B. Fuller recognize more frequently now how much -- how enabling our technologies are for our customers and how much of a very small part of the end product cost we are so much so that we can enable them to achieve total system cost or total end product cost reductions by bringing them better, higher-performing, higher-priced products of our own.

John Corkrean
Executive VP & CFO

And Lucas, just to tie that back to the comment you made around potential for raw material weakness and how does that impact pricing. That's really the primary reason we look at the two together, right? So we believe that we're better forecasters of the two combined than each one individually. Because if the economy were to weaken further and pricing were harder to come by, I think that would create a raw material upside or if raw materials were, let's say, we saw some economic pickup and raw material prices started to move up, I think we could be more aggressive on pricing. So I think we feel good about the pricing and raws together. We feel good about our pricing strategy, but feel particularly good about our ability to predict pricing and raws.

Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.

David Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Just in construction, you mentioned the environment is weakening. Is that more a U.S. comment or a European comment?

Celeste Mastin
President, CEO & Director

David, it is both. The construction market has been particularly weak in Europe. And I'm not saying that's not the case here in the U.S., but with the construction of data centers here in the U.S. and our success penetrating that market, we're able to offset some of that commercial construction weakness here that I think others may be feeling.

David Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Understood. And just on the packaging weakness, can you discuss the competitive intensity in that market as volumes decline? And do you think you've maintained your share, i.e., not lost any share in this downward trend?

Celeste Mastin
President, CEO & Director

Sure. So it is a competitive market. It always has been a competitive market. I do think that is becoming more and more intense. And it actually coincides with our portfolio review and our interest in making sure that we are working with the best customers where we can bring the most value, where we can bring innovation and they're seeking solutions, whereas there are parts of that market where we have deemphasized them kind of organically selected out of some of those spaces. And so yes, it's competitive, but I still feel like we're bringing a lot to the table for those customers. And our service delivery is what makes a difference, that in innovation.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.

Jeffrey Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I guess just two final questions. When you look at your overall geographic markets, if you exclude the places where you're gaining market share, do you see an acceleration in demand growth in any of your 3 major regions? Are there green shoots?

Celeste Mastin
President, CEO & Director

Excluding places where we're gaining share, and I'd like to say that we're creating our own green shoots, Jeff, right? But the greatest acceleration that I saw in Q4 was China. China was really exciting because we finally saw a bounce back there that took it to a level that it had historically operated at 2024, Q1 of 2025, et cetera, double-digit organic growth. And what we had seen in Q2 and Q3 was really a pause there, right? While with all of the tariff chaos that occurred, we saw the Chinese manufacturers pull back a little bit. But I don't know if you saw this, China just reported $1 trillion trade surplus for 2025, which is a record. So they're back on track and shipping to other parts of the world. I think that's why our packaging business did well in China in Q4. And if I had to point to any green shoots, I would say that would be the one.

Jeffrey Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then finally, why do you expect as a base case for your HHC volumes to be down a little bit in 2026?

Celeste Mastin
President, CEO & Director

I expect really continued constraint in the packaging space, Jeff. Our CPG customers, the packaging customers are struggling with affordability in our bigger economies, which are Europe and the U.S. for that business. So I think that in Asia and Latin America, we may see something different. But in the bigger economies, we continue to see that constraint.

Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.

Kevin McCarthy
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

I just had a housekeeping question for you. In your Reg G reconciliation, I think there's a $37.4 million special item related to, as I understood it, two issues, litigation and product claims and also an insurance gain partially offsetting that. Can you unpack that a little bit and help us understand what's going on as well as comment on whether it's a cash item or noncash?

John Corkrean
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. So it's predominantly the legal claim that's driving that number. And it's not -- it's a noncash item in the quarter. But it's associated with a product liability legal claim related to the divested flooring business, amount was about $35 million pretax, about $25 million after tax. So we recorded a reserve in the fourth quarter. Reserve doesn't consider any insurance recovery and we have coverage that we believe will cover a substantial portion, but it's predominantly a product liability claim related to the divested flooring business.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.

David Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Just in BAS/BAS in Q1, what do you expect volumes to be down?

John Corkrean
Executive VP & CFO

So I'd say we probably won't get into that level of detail, but I would say it's probably not dissimilar to Q4. I think we see some of the macro headwinds. We have some of the impact of having the customer gains last year that we've sort of annualized against. So I'd say similar to Q4, David.
