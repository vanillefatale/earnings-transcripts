Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Mama's Creations' third quarter fiscal 2026 earnings conference call.

This conference is being recorded today, Monday, December 8th, 2025, and the earnings press release accompanying this conference call was issued after the market closed today.

Adam L Michaels

Thank you, Luke, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'd like to welcome you to our third quarter fiscal 2026 financial results conference call. This was a transformational quarter for Mama's, one where the business continued to scale, our retail momentum accelerated, and we took a major step forward in our long-term strategy with the addition of the Bayshore facility through the recent acquisition of Crown One. Our performance this quarter reflects both the strength of demand for high-quality deli-prepared foods and the work our teams have done to build a modern, scalable, highly efficient platform. Revenue growth again outpaced the category, accelerating our market share gains, supported by balanced geographic expansion, disciplined trade and marketing promotion investments, and new wins across multiple channels.

Even in a macro environment where consumers remain selective, our value proposition continues to resonate: grandma-quality food at the right price, ready when they are. I would like to start with our recent acquired facility in Bayshore, New York, because while many think the acquisition announcement is the finish line, for us, just like in a triathlon, it's just the first leg, and we are already thinking ahead to the next phase of integration, and I could tell you we're off to a tremendous start, passing and picking off competitors left and right. To start, this Bayshore team is exceptional. Andy has unleashed an incredibly strong management team. This team is eager to win, and the tools, resources, and colleagues shared amongst East Rutherford and Farmingdale are creating a powerhouse team.

Culture must never be underestimated, and now that Bayshore is back home with its food manufacturing colleagues and their work is core to the Mama's organization, Bayshore is reborn. Our newly acquired facility in Bayshore brings a recently upgraded USDA facility, automated and artisan production capabilities, and a reputation for grandma-quality items that fit squarely within our brand promise. It also opens the door to a customer set that historically has been difficult to access. The proximity of their facility to our Farmingdale facility gives us a structural advantage: similar grills, joint training, and shared playbooks, which allow us to move quickly on procurement, labor alignment, and SKU rationalization. In three short months, I am proud to report that 100% of Bayshore's procurement is firmly centralized. This means we're leveraging our volume across all three facilities, driving specification alignment and inventory management.

For example, leveraging Mama's scale, we were able to reduce Bayshore beef costs double digits in the first month alone. If that is not exciting enough, we've already realized our one-plant, three-location strategy, transitioning some East Rutherford and some Farmingdale production to Bayshore, unlocking capacity, reducing overtime, and increasing absorption across our network. Thanks to Skip and his team, in three short months, you can no longer see where one plant begins and the other ends. We are one-plant, delivering on our shared one-stop-shop strategy. The team is already working through even more synergy capture opportunities, and we expect to lift Bayshore's gross margin towards our historical corporate range over the next year. But stepping back, they immediately strengthened our category position and scale that accelerates our path towards long-term $1 billion revenue ambition. I'm appreciative of the Bayshore team's commitment to our vision and thankful for our new teammates.

Turning to consumer trends, the grocery deli is becoming one of the most important battlegrounds in modern food service. Consumers aren't choosing between brands inside the restaurant channel. They're choosing between the restaurant channel and the grocery-prepared food set. Even major restaurant operators like Chipotle noted on their most recent earnings calls that they're not losing guests to other chains. They're losing trips to grocery and food-at-home occasions. That dynamic directly benefits us. Industry data shows that the share of shoppers replacing a restaurant meal with deli-prepared foods has more than doubled since 2017. Consumers want speed, value, freshness, and the ability to shop for the rest of the household at the same time. Fully cooked meats grew 4.8% over the past year. Chicken remains the top performer in the category, and the overall retail food service segments has grown to over $52 billion.

These are the exact spaces where Mama's competes and wins. Operationally, we continue to execute against our Four C Strategy and strategic pillars: Cost, Controls, Culture, and Catapult. On cost, our logistics and procurement teams again delivered measurable improvements, with freight down another 30 basis points versus prior year, driven by denser freight, better material planning, lowering our transportation expenses. Impressive work by Anthony and his team has taken advantage of lower chicken commodity prices in the quarter, capturing below-market spot buys and marrying it with raise, increase, trimming execution. While we know this won't last forever, these opportunities highlight our agility and how quickly we can react when the market shifts. As we plan for fiscal 2027, Bayshore's chicken needs will nearly double our overall chicken volume demand, which positions us to negotiate stronger supplier partnerships and unlock better unit economics.

I'm excited to share with you today that we're in final negotiations with our commodity suppliers to lock in agreements for calendar 2026. This will add much-appreciated stability to our supply chain, allowing Skip to better manage his costs and will allow Chris to more effectively manage his pricing strategies. Under controls, the work Alberto is doing to build new capabilities around demand and supply planning are creating massive dividends. The visibility is improving our customer service levels, production efficiency, and most importantly, informing our fiscal 2027 planning. For example, because of this demand visibility, we've been able to increase our chicken throughput by nearly 40% versus prior year, while reducing overtime by over 400 basis points. What gets measured, gets improved is not just a mantra in our organization.

It's how each of our 600 associates work every single day, regardless of which of our three facilities we are in. I also must thank John and his IT team for making the Bayshore transition seamless. We didn't miss a beat, and the work he'll be doing over the next six months in partnership with Andy and his team will allow us to move to one ERP system, adding even more real-time insights and analysis into our business. On culture, I honestly am not sure what to highlight because everything we do starts with culture. Abby and her team were there at 5:00 A.M. on Tuesday morning after Labor Day to welcome our new Bayshore colleagues. Not even sure she left that building for that first week, ensuring our new colleagues had their forms filled out, payroll transitioned, benefits updated, and most importantly, had their new Mama swag.

A week later, magically, everyone was a new Mama's employee, and we had only lost one employee at his choosing. In all of my years doing M&A, I think this was the smoothest transition yet. Thank you, Abby, Claudia, and Candy, and to the Farmingdale employees who rolled up their sleeves before their day job to ensure our Bayshore employees felt welcome. Another culture moment to highlight is the successful transition of our company from a make-to-order to a make-to-stock organization. This means with Skip's guidance, we have now created inventory stock of our highest velocity items, resulting in higher service levels for our customers and lower overtime for our operations because we're anticipating our customers' needs. This would not be possible without the cross-functional alignment across sales, manufacturing, logistics, and finance.

This is just one more example of how this organization has evolved from a subscale Northeast meatball company three years ago into a national one-stop-shop deli solution with a foundation to support anything our customers need. Oh, and did I mention our first-ever battle of the bridges where our New York employees took on our New Jersey employees at soccer, sorry, football? Let's just say that I personally won, as everyone made it into the factory Monday morning safe and sound. I'll take the win. In a new year, while I will not be able to speak to the look of their play, I can guarantee you that they will be decked out in new Mama's Kit. And on Catapult, which reflects our purposeful and profitable growth, our teams delivered another quarter of market share gaining momentum.

In Q3, we exceeded our goal of adding not one, but two tier-one national retailers. The first is Target, where we have confirmed two branded sleeve items to begin shipping in February, with a staged rollout to 1,995 stores and additional items in the final setup stages for later distribution. In Food Lion, another major national retailer, we're entering 1,100 stores this month with two new branded chicken items, as well as rolling out three branded sleeves starting at 400 stores. This is a huge testament to Chris and his team after years of tastings, packaging optimization, and hand-cramping paperwork. Congrats to Peter for getting us over the finish line. These wins reflect both the credibility of our brand and the demand from retailers for turnkey deli-prepared solutions that drive traffic to their stores and save on labor. The Club Channel was another bright spot.

Thanks to Scott after a successful five-region rotation of our branded cheese-stuffed chicken meatballs in Q3, our first national Costco MVM with branded beef meatballs hit in Q4 and is already creating a noticeable lift in trial and brand awareness. Thanks to Eric and his East Rutherford team, our production is ahead of schedule, creating confidence that we can deliver whatever Costco needs, whenever, and wherever they need it. Costco continues to be one of our strongest strategic partners, and the MVM confirms their confidence in our ability to execute at a national scale. We look forward to reporting Q4 results, which will reflect the revenue from this MVM. Marketing continues to play a meaningful role in amplifying this momentum.

From digital programs and clubs to influencer-driven activation and Sam's Club and strategic partnerships with Amazon Fresh and Instacart, we're building a modern consumer-facing brand that meets shoppers where they already are: online, on mobile, and inside the store. With the successful rollout of our new technology-enabled Meals for One, or MFOs, and paninis at Publix, Lauren and her team took the opportunity to leverage social, digital, and in-person marketing execution to amplify the launch. But Publix was just one example. Retail and social support delivered over 24 million impressions in Q3 and a double-digit return on advertising spend. Our digital media is not only attracting new consumers but also creating FOMO with our retail buyers and prospective buyers in the industry.

As our teenage boys would say, "Sorry, not sorry." Finally, while our focus remains on executing Bayshore integration and supporting organic growth, we continue to evaluate additional opportunities that fit our disciplined acquisition framework: fair price, strategic alignment, operational synergy, and high confidence in integration. With our strengthened balance sheet, the right systems in place, and a deeper team, we have the ability to act when the right opportunities emerge. In summary, Q3 showed the strength of our operating model, the resiliency of our consumer demand for deli-prepared foods, and the early impact of the Bayshore acquisition. Our retail wins, club momentum, and expanding capabilities give us a clear runway for profitable growth heading into the next fiscal year and beyond. I am incredibly proud and appreciative of our team and look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters ahead.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Anthony Gruber, our Chief Financial Officer, to walk through some key financial details from the third quarter of fiscal 2026. Anthony?

Anthony Gruber

Thank you, Adam. Moving to the financial results, revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 increased 50% to $47.3 million as compared to $31.5 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase was largely attributable to the acquisition of Crown One, as well as robust double-digit growth in the legacy business on a pre-acquisition basis. Year-to-date, our organic growth remains at 20%. Gross profit increased 56.6% to $11.1 million, or 23.6% of total revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $7.1 million, or 22.6% of total revenues in the same year-ago quarter.

The increases in gross margin rate were primarily attributable to operational efficiency, improvements across the organization, in addition to tremendous success managing our raw chicken prices, partially offset by beef commodity headwinds and the addition of lower margin Crown One sales, which the company expects to bring in line with the corporate average in the mid-20% range over the next year. As a reminder, all of this is inclusive of right-sizing our trade promotion investments when our margins are achieved and the funds are available. Year-to-date, our trade rate sits over 3%. This is nearly $2.5 million ahead of prior year and even more effective returns. From a marketing perspective, year-to-date, our spend is at 2%, nearly $1 million ahead of prior year. Combined, this is nearly a $6.5 million year-to-date investment in our future, and we are already seeing the fruits of our labor.

We remain vigilant in managing the magnitude and ROI of our trade and marketing spend and see it as a critical tool to achieve our ambitions. Operating expenses totaled $10.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $6.6 million in the same year-ago quarter. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses increased in the third quarter fiscal 2026 to 21.8% from 20.8%. Operating expenses in the third quarter were impacted by the recent acquisition of Crown One Enterprises, as well as $1 million in non-recurring transaction expenses tied to the aforementioned acquisition. Excluding the aforementioned transaction-related expenses, our OpEx as a percent of revenues would remain below 20%.

Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 increased 31.7% to $0.5 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share in the same year-ago quarter. Third quarter net income totaled 1.1% of revenue, as compared to 1.3% in the same year-ago quarter. As a reminder, the third quarter of fiscal 2026 net income included the impact of $1 million of costs associated with the acquisition of Crown One Enterprises. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased 118% to $3.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $1.7 million in the same year-ago quarter. Cash and cash equivalents, as of October 31st, 2025, grew to $18.1 million, as compared to $7.2 million as of January 31st, 2025.

Primarily driven by improved profitability, ongoing working capital optimization, and the private placement completed concurrent with the acquisition of Crown One. As of October 31st, 2025, total debt stood at $6.4 million, as compared to $5.1 million as of January 31st, 2025. As we clearly demonstrated, this robust balance sheet proactively prepares us to pursue whatever organic or inorganic growth opportunities may come our way. This completes my prepared comments. Now, before we begin our question-and-answer session, I'd like to turn the call back to Adam for some closing remarks. Adam?

Adam L Michaels

Thank you, Anthony. As we look across the business exiting Q3, the platform is operating with more precision, higher throughput, and a stronger growth engine than at any point since I joined Mama's. Bayshore is already adding meaningful production depth and giving us access to premium customers with premium items we historically couldn't reach.

Our focus from here is straightforward: elevate Bayshore's margin profile, integrate their workflows into our system quickly and cleanly, and unlock the synergy opportunities that come with having three facilities operating as one coordinated network. This is the same disciplined approach we used when we shaped Mama's in late 2022, and the proximity of the Bayshore facility makes execution even more efficient. Our teams know exactly what to do and in what order: align processes, stabilize labor, optimize procurement, and accelerate cross-selling. The opportunity set is significant, and we're moving with urgency. While our leadership ensures we take every opportunity to celebrate both the large and small wins with our team internally, it is always great to be recognized externally. In Q3, Forbes recognized us as one of the most successful small-cap companies in 2026.

TIME recognized us as one of America's growth leaders in 2026, and locally, we are a finalist in NJBIZ 2025 Business of the Year. I am so happy others are recognizing the hard work our 600 associates do every day to deliver for our customers and delight our consumers. Confidence across the organization is high. The consumer shift towards deli-prepared foods is accelerating. Our customer pipeline is expanding with tier-one retailers, and our operational backbone is built to support materially more volume. We are entering the next phase of our growth with momentum, commitment, and a clear line of sight into the value we could create. With that, Luke, let's open the line for questions.
