Carlos de Alba
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great to see progress in Indonesia. Just wanted to understand maybe a little bit the guidance for the outer years, considering the opportunity in leaching that you have in North America, does the numbers -- your guidance include the leaching reaching around 800 million pounds in 2028 or it is not included in that official guidance?

Kathleen Quirk
CEO, President & Director

Carlos, we've included in our outlook between 250 million and 300 million in 2026 and have not included anything beyond that for expansion. So it's around the long term, we've got around 250 million pounds in these numbers, and have the opportunity we expect to be at 300 million this year with an opportunity to scale to 400 million in '27, so there's some upside in our numbers, obviously. The slide where we're showing what the potential is getting to 2 billion pounds in the U.S. is -- includes the Bagdad expansion and getting the incremental volumes out of the leach program. So we have the potential to get to roughly 2 billion pounds in the U.S. but those aren't included in the '27-'28 guidance at this point.

The unit cash cost in South America are moving higher. Can you maybe elaborate what's going on there? And how we should think about costs there over the next few years?

Kathleen Quirk
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Katja, in South America, we're forecasting net cash cost in the $2.58 range on average for 2026. Those are very similar to what we experienced during the fourth quarter of $2.57 per pound. When you look at the comparison to 2025, the increase relates mostly to labor and energy, power costs as well as labor. You've got also a weaker dollar as well. So that's reflective, but it's very similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter, and we'll carry that run rate forward.

Our next question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi.

Alexander Hacking
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Yes. Thanks, Kathleen, and team. The 2027 target to get cost in the U.S. down to $2.50 a pound. Could you maybe elaborate on how you plan to get there? Because cost last year was around $3.10, you're guiding for around $3 next year -- sorry, $3 this year, even with a nice increase in U.S. production. Like how is -- how are you getting another $0.50 out by 2027?

Kathleen Quirk
CEO, President & Director

It's really a target, and it assumes that we are successful with scaling our leach opportunity as well as continuing to drive efficiencies within the U.S. business. So it's really coming from adding volumes at a low incremental cost. We have a number of initiatives, not only in the leach initiative, but we have a number of initiatives really as we look at our U.S. operations focused on minimizing downtime, improving -- and just improving all of the efficiencies. And so we have really an opportunity to increase our volumes basically with the same operating rates that we have today. So that's the target that we have and bringing in lower cost volumes will bring down the average.

Our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.

Bob Brackett
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

I'd like to talk about Slide 14 where you highlight America's Copper Champion. We think rough numbers, the U.S. consumes 4 billion pounds of copper, 2 billion of which is imported. In that context, if you look at your targets, you'd be adding rounding up 0.8 billion of that 2 billion of imports, which is a significant amount of those imports. And I'll highlight that leach initiatives deliver refined copper, not concentrate. So I guess the question would be, can you do more, but also the question is, how do you focus on this target in light of what copper tariffs could be going forward? Is that driving this production or just the unit economics in any world driving this production target?

Kathleen Quirk
CEO, President & Director

Thanks for those comments. And to highlight the leach initiatives, the exciting thing about these opportunities for us is that we're able to -- with success, and we've got to have success on our additive work and with the heat injections that we're trialing this year. With success, the incremental cost of these pounds of copper that we're bringing on are very low cost relative to the cost of what you'd have to do to actually mine the material and take it all the way through a smelter. So these are very low incremental cost pounds. They do not require significant capital. We already have the material that's been mined and it's really the processing piece and sending some incremental dollars to improve recoveries is what we're targeting. So that is really a very exciting value creation opportunity for us when you're talking about adding these kinds of volumes in a relatively short period of time.

When you think about copper projects taking 10 years or more, if we're successful here, we can be adding a new mine with very, very low operating cost and very insignificant capital expenditures. So that's a real opportunity for us. The Bagdad project is more of a conventional opportunity. As we've talked about, we've got a very significant reserve there. And what we have been talking about for a number of years now is the opportunity to build new processing facilities and bring that value forward, and we've been doing work on enhancing the optionality of that project.

And as we look at that project today, it requires roughly a $4 average copper price to justify the investment. And of course, copper prices are higher, much higher than that today and support the project. We look at a broad range of projects -- of copper prices when we qualify a project. But this is one we want to put our infrastructure where we have big reserve positions, and this is one where we believe should be developed and can be developed within a short time frame.

And so we're working to make sure that we have our arms around the capital and that we can execute the project efficiently. But that will be a nice addition also to domestic production in the U.S. Tariffs...

Bob Brackett
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

A quick follow-up -- please.

Kathleen Quirk
CEO, President & Director

We're not really looking at tariffs to support this investment. We're -- it's hard to predict what those are. We're just really looking at a broad range of absolute prices and how we can deliver a low operating cost mine and improve resiliency in the U.S.

Bob Brackett
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

Great. A quick follow-up would be, in the past, you've talked about the next phase of leaching as being a Phase 3. In today's presentation, you're starting to take that Phase 3 and tell us specifically how you're going to achieve it. Should I interpret that to mean that your level of conviction in the 600 million-pound target has increased over the last year or so?

Kathleen Quirk
CEO, President & Director

Certainly, with the additive work that we've done, prior to this past year, we were doing mostly lab testing. Now we're doing more work in the field where we're actually deploying additives on stockpiles in the field. We're going to be doing that on a broader basis during 2026, and we've advanced these heat projects where essentially, we're taking the solutions that we apply on the stockpiles and heating those solutions as injecting heat into the stockpiles. And so the -- what I say is 2026 is a pivotal year for us because we should have results on how heat and additives combine, and that really will set us up for scaling the opportunity.

But you're right, we've made really good progress, particularly on the additives. We're excited to test this heat opportunity both at Morenci and El Abra this year, and that's going to be very informative to us on our path. But we've made a lot of progress in converting some of the R&D work to early positive results. So the additive we end up with will likely be a little different than the additive we're using today. Additive we're using today is performing well. It is giving us incremental production. But we do believe, based on what we've been seeing in the lab that we'll use a variety of additives depending on the stockpiles to drive the best recoveries that we can get. And we really think we're on to something. We've got more work to do, but this is a huge value creator for Freeport, particularly in our U.S. business.

Our next question comes from the line of Lawson Winder with BofA Securities.

Lawson Winder
BofA Securities, Research Division

And Kathleen, thank you for today's update. If I could just pick up on some of the comments you made on Bagdad 2X, can you maybe give us a sense of a more precise timing this year for the update? That would be one. And then thinking about the CapEx, I mean, the slides highlight that the CapEx is still under review. What we've been seeing in the industry over the past several years is typical CapEx inflates at about 5% per year versus the 2023 $3.5 billion, is that like a reasonable way to think about what's the level of CapEx inflation? And then are there any changes to the plan being contemplated with this latest updated study that could potentially change the approach or the overall mine plan for the CapEx?

And then just finally, I mean, you highlight the attractiveness of this project at the current copper price given that it works at $4. I mean outside of the copper price, I mean, what other factors will you consider when thinking about approving this project potentially later this year? So I know that's sort of 4 questions, but really just about Bagdad 2X and a few more details on that project.

Kathleen Quirk
CEO, President & Director

Okay. So as you pointed out, we -- the $3.5 billion for the project was based on work that we had done at the end of 2023. And what we're doing in the first half of this year is continuing our engineering work and actually getting to a point where we can have enough of the engineering done to go out to our vendors to actually get fixed pricing. So that's really where we want to put ourselves as we go through the next 6 months so that we have more concrete bids on what the project will cost. And so we're looking to make a decision on the project in -- when we have this information at midyear and so we don't know the answer to your question yet about this 5% per annum. We know there is cost inflation. We've been trying to assess whether the tariffs will have any impact on some of the components that are involved here.

And we'll continue to do value engineering to try to keep the capital intensity of the project as low as possible. But we want to do enough front-end work so that when we qualify the project for investment, we can deliver and execute on that plan. And that's what we're working on in the first part of this year. We're also doing some work on the power infrastructure and making some deposits there. So we've added $150 million in capital associated with this project that will put us in a position to make a decision.

In terms of the factors that we are looking at in addition to the copper price, and we want to look at the long term and the range of prices and how this project would perform. We also want to make sure that we have the right workforce set up, and we've been investing in infrastructure. Labor has been a challenge in the U.S., and that's what partially what drove us to going to autonomous during 2025 to set up better optionality for Bagdad for expansion in the future. We want to optimize the performance of the autonomous fleet. We're not getting exactly what we expected to get from the performance of the autonomous fleet, but we've got progress ongoing to get us to a point where we're comfortable that the autonomous fleet is capable of running at these higher rates.

So we've got some other things going on to derisk the plan as we go through the first half. But those are the major factors, is confidence in our ability to execute the capital plan, confidence in our ability to operate efficiently. Part of the goal here in addition to bringing on additional volumes is to bring on those volumes at a lower incremental cost than our current cost and take advantage of efficiencies. So that work we're going to be doing as well over the next several months as we get to an investment decision. But this is a project that is pretty straightforward. It's a relatively short lead time, and we just want to make sure that we can deliver on the economics that we set up at the start. Cory Stevens is on the call. And Cory, anything that you want to add there, either on the Bagdad expansion, the leach initiative or our focus on bringing down our unit cost in the U.S., we'd be happy to see if you have any insights that you want to add to that.

Cory Stevens
President & COO of Freeport Americas

No, I appreciate that, Kathleen. And yes, just to comment on the Bagdad work. The team is super energized. We're working through a lot of the incoming infrastructure requirements and designs and long lead items from like power upgrades and so forth. So -- and then in parallel, like we talked about, the autonomous work, very inspiring. It's still early days there. We really only went full autonomous late in the summer. So there's a bit of a learning curve there, but we're on a good track, and the team is going to figure that out as we go forward.

On the leach side, the ramp-up is really based on a lot of the initiatives that are coming to pass this year. So heat, we talked about at Morenci, at El Abra, those are big demonstration activities going on there. And then yesterday, as a matter of fact, we started another leach stockpile at our New Mexico operation at Chino. And there, we're using chemical heat. So we term that one as the perfect pile, it's an engineered heat that we've built confidence around our lab work there that's really giving us a lot of excitement there that really can facilitate not only a benefit to Chino but could change the way that we design future stockpiles going forward to enhance the ultimate activity that's coming out of those. So lots of moving parts, lots of activities, more to come this year.

Our next question will come from the line of Bill Peterson with JPMorgan.

William Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

It sounds like Indonesia is on track with the timing guidance from last year. I was wondering if you can add any incremental lessons learned at Grasberg since the November update. You called PB 2 and 3 on schedule for 2Q '26. Any further granularity you could provide on timing where it could land in the quarter? What would make it come in faster versus extended?

Kathleen Quirk
CEO, President & Director

Thank you. And Mark Johnson's on the line, and he can add to these comments, but we did an update in mid-November on the investigation and we have learned a lot. And as I mentioned, we are adopting the recommendations from the investigation. The plan in terms of what we laid out in that time frame in November is very much the same. We've been executing on that plan. We've been achieving the results. As we mentioned, the mud removal in the -- within the mine workings has gone well, and we're 97% of what we need to be to start up Production Blocks 2 and 3. We've just completed a cement pour at one of these protective barriers that we talked about that's needed to restart Production Block 2 and 3.

And so the work that we're doing between now and start-up really is related mostly to infrastructure. Now that we have these plugs in, we'll be able to advance that pour. But we haven't given a specific date within the first -- within the second quarter, but we would expect it would be in the first half of the second quarter at this point, and we're on track to do that. And Mark, I don't know if you want to add anything about that and also add maybe any comments about the overall risk management we're doing on mud removal from the surface.

Mark Johnson
President & COO of Freeport-McMoRan Indonesia

Yes. The plan, as you stated, that we came up in November, the team's done a great job of executing that. It's primarily driven at first with the cleanup of the mud. That is essentially complete for the PB 2, PB 3 start-up. Obviously, there were some challenges there that a lot of -- it's not -- it's kind of a unique work environment. We dealt with some localized drainage issues, required pumping and the team was quick to respond. Very happy also with the response from some of our key suppliers. A lot of this infrastructure that we're building is the communication systems that allow us to do the remote mining. So our suppliers on that end have risen to the challenge, so we don't see any problem with the supply chain side of things. We continue to work with our consultants and verify our plan, make it more robust.

We're looking at some new tools for our cave management, that will also play into how we look and mitigate risk, and all of that's progressing quite well. Really, I don't see any real hurdles at this point to be able to start up as we planned. Any variation, I think, will be relatively minor plus and minuses. I think it's a very solid plan to start up. The ramp-up is something that we've spent time looking at as well. We have good history on that as to how we'll reopen some of these draw points, do it in a very cautious and safe manner step-by-step and observe and adjust as we go. So anyway, I'm very happy with the overall progress and where we are today. So PB 2 and PB 3 is the lion's share of our production. And then obviously, we're also working towards the PB 1 area restart.

Our next question will come from the line of Liam Fitzpatrick with Deutsche Bank.

Liam Fitzpatrick
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Just a couple of follow-up questions on the GBC profile. It sounds like the initial start-ups for 2026 are going to plan. But in terms of 2027, is it possible that PB 1S could be brought forward ahead of the mid-2027 start-up that you have? And then for PB 1C, if you conclude that you can't restart production from that block, do you have the flexibility to open up other areas and bring those into production also by late 2027?

Kathleen Quirk
CEO, President & Director

We haven't -- with respect to our plans for PB 1, the work that we've done to lay out this plan, we're continuing to expect that Production Block 1 South will be a mid-'27 start-up. And then we're going to continue to evaluate the PB 1C. Our focus really is getting the 85% up and running that we're talking about during 2026. And as we go through and in parallel, we're working on PB 1. But our focus for the current period is to get the substantial amount of production restored and then we'll look to see how to optimize and enhance it. But we're not -- at this point, not looking at advancing PB 1 South. But we'll be in a position to continue to evaluate that as we go. With the question about the PB 1C, do you want to comment on that, if we decide not to go back into PB 1C?

Mark Johnson
President & COO of Freeport-McMoRan Indonesia

Yes. We have some other -- we haven't had to face this yet, but some of the other opportunities there would be to change our sequence and go to PB 1 North. We also have some options to incrementally add production from Deep MLZ. It would be at a lower grade if we did that. And the potential would be to continue to develop and ramp up PB 2, PB 3 beyond what we have in our plans. But all of those are forward looking. We don't have any -- our plan is still to proceed as we've shown. On Slide 31, a lot of those initiatives there on the mud removal are focused on PB 1. So the execution of those and the results of those will very much drive how we look at what our options or what our future plans may look like.

Liam Fitzpatrick
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Just a quick follow-up. If you wanted to do PB 1N, you could bring that in around a similar time, late '27 early 2028.

Mark Johnson
President & COO of Freeport-McMoRan Indonesia

Yes. We'd have to do some different development. It's a change in the sequence. It would be something that we'd have to work through. We've talked about it at a high level, but we don't have anything firm. And I'd hate to -- until I have that, I'd hate to respond on the timing, but we've got a lot of development capability. It's not -- it's adjacent to what we're already doing. We are in the process of developing all of the infrastructure around that. So that would be an option, but we don't have any firm plans.

Our next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Wells Fargo.

Timna Tanners
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to ask in light of the sharp move in copper lately, if you have any fresh thoughts about the recycling opportunity. I know that you have that plan and program at Atlantic Copper. Are there other potential initiatives that could leverage secondary material? And then along those same lines, any thoughts on substitution, copper for silver in solar, but also aluminum for copper in other applications, it would be great to get your thoughts.

Kathleen Quirk
CEO, President & Director

You pointed out the CirCular project that we're doing in Spain at our facility at Atlantic Copper, where we're completing a project to process scrap from electronics. So it's got a lot of precious metals associated with it. And so that project, we're completing the middle of this year. We do some scrap processing in the U.S. at our existing facilities. It's not -- we follow that business, but it's not the core of what we do. Our core really is around producing, mining and processing what we mine. But we'll look on the margin if there's an opportunity, but it's not our -- obviously not our business.

In terms of substitution, that is a topic that people have talked -- long talked about. We believe that the properties of copper because of its superior conductivity are compelling. When you talk about data centers and that sort of thing, copper still is very, very important component of data centers. There will be substitution and thrifting as prices rise. But when you look at the big picture, you still need a lot more copper to be able to support the demand, the secular demand trends that are ongoing. So we're very confident that copper will still be viewed as a superior metal really from its conductivity, recognizing that there will be thrifting, there will be substitution that takes place as that relative value changes.

Richard Adkerson

This is Richard. That's inevitable, but it will be in the context of a higher copper price.

Our next question will come from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James.

Brian MacArthur
Raymond James Ltd., Research Division

Two questions on Indonesia. First, in the fourth quarter, I see there's no export duties, but when I look at your guidance going forward, TCs are up to $0.43 versus historical levels. Can you just tell me how you're accounting for that, whether there are export duties in that guidance going forward or what's going on or whether that's just inter-transfer of costs as you go to the new smelter as things ramp up?

And my second question has to do with KL. Obviously, it's getting bigger. Is that all additive post 2030, i.e., the higher production at KL, you still have the mill capacity, you don't have to do anything, and I see capital has gone up. Is that just inflation? Or is that given the KL ore is a little more complicated and you have to do something else?

Kathleen Quirk
CEO, President & Director

In terms of the question around export duties, we're no longer exporting concentrates. And so we don't have any export duties in our numbers. The TC number is really just the internal smelter costs, the operation of the existing smelter as well as the tolling fees that we pay -- the operating cost of the new smelter and the tolling fees we pay at PT Smelting. So they're really kind of internal costs. Of course, it doesn't include when you're comparing selling concentrate to a third party, that rate reflects all of the byproducts in the free metal. So going forward at PTFI, you're going to have the cost of the smelter in that processing line, that TC/RC line, but all the benefits that you get from the free metal, the byproducts, et cetera, will be in the revenue line. So it's a little different than historically when we've been just selling most of our concentrates.

That -- and Brian, we can follow up more with you on that if I didn't fully answer it. But on the Kucing Liar, this is actually a positive here. We've been looking for some time at what's optimal between Grasberg Block Cave and Kucing Liar operating rates to look at what is optimal from an NPV standpoint and as you know, the footprint of KL is very big and a lot of it was just carrying forward after 2041. But in looking at the Grasberg Block Cave and Kucing Liar and the need potentially to invest in pyrite handling and processing facilities for certain types of ore, we developed a plan that allowed us to defer a significant amount of pyrite processing that would have been associated with Grasberg Block Cave and actually defer that out. And so you see KL rates going from where we were projecting 90,000 tons a day to 130,000. So we've added production from KL. Grasberg Block Cave is slightly smaller. All of this is just timing because with an extension, we'll get those reserves over time. But this plan allows us to defer processing for pyrite.

Brian MacArthur
Raymond James Ltd., Research Division

Got it. So you wouldn't have to make -- I mean, the mill will be what, 240 or whatever at it's max like it used to be before. You're just substituting A for B in this process.

Kathleen Quirk
CEO, President & Director

Right. Exactly. And what it allows us to do is defer the time frame when we need to spend capital on the pyrite handling.

Brian MacArthur
Raymond James Ltd., Research Division

Great. And just back -- we can take the rest of this offline. But just that $0.43 for Indonesia this year for treatment charges, is that what -- is that inflated this year because we have a lower production rate and it's a ramp-up, i.e., on an ongoing basis, would it be better than that?

Kathleen Quirk
CEO, President & Director

Yes.
