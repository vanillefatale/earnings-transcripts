[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of John Lovallo with UBS.

John Lovallo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

The first one is maybe just a little bit more philosophical. I mean I understand the changes in the way you're providing the outlook relating to the full year deliveries and the gross margin. But there also seems to be a bit of conservatism, particularly in the gross margin guide that maybe wasn't always the case. So I mean -- can you help me understand if there's been some change there and maybe instilling a little bit more conservatism into the outlook? And also, is there a chunk of spec that's going to be delivered in the first quarter that's going to negatively impact that margin?

Jeffrey Mezger
Chairman & CEO

John, I can make a few comments and then pass it over to Rob Dillard. There is still some inventory that we have to clear as part of our transition to more built-to-order sales. And we have factored that in, in the guidance that we provided. One of the things that we touched on in our comments is that some of this inventory is aged in that it was built at much higher build costs. And as we've reacted to the market, we're lowering our costs on new deliveries, but we have to clear these older specs that have a higher cost base. So it is impacting the margin. It's a short-term thing, but it's something we have to power through.

Within our guide, I would say that it's just a guide. It's not conservative. It's not aggressive. It's just realistic. And -- if you think about it, one of the real drivers of the lesser margin in the quarter is the loss leverage because our revenue is down. And it's a fairly significant move sequentially from Q4 to Q1 due to the loss in revenue leverage. I don't know if you got any other color, Rob, do you want to?

Robert Dillard
CFO & EVP

Yes. Those are the two main points there, John. I think that it's you can't express enough how important in Q1, the seasonality and the leverage is having an impact on that Q1 margin expectation. Typically, that's 100 to 150 basis points, and we think that we'll be near the top end of that, if not above it, that there is a real opportunity for leverage as we get through the year, as Jeff said, and that the leverage in Q1 given kind of our conservatism on the delivery numbers is creating some conservatism as you see it through the cycle of that guide. There are also, as Jeff said, with some product mix as we shift through some of the older and older specs that haven't had the benefit of the direct cost reductions. And we saw a bit of that also in Q4 as well, which I think was really the incremental units versus guide and a big part of the margin compression versus where we thought we were going to be. So we think that there's real opportunity as we go through the year. but we're really pegging where we expect to be in Q1 on those factors.

John Lovallo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. Yes, that's really helpful. And maybe sticking on a similar topic, I don't recall you guys ever giving an adjusted EPS number before. And I'm curious kind of the thought process behind excluding the accelerated stock comp, if it's really just timing related and seemingly future quarters could benefit from less stock comp if the total amount is changing. And also, it seems a little bit unusual to exclude impairments from adjusted EPS. So just maybe your thoughts on that would be very helpful.

Robert Dillard
CFO & EVP

Yes, John. We just wanted to give you a like-for-like number because the timing on the equity expense just where it was, it was significant enough that we wanted to give you a like-for-like number that was relevant so that you could make comparisons and so that you could also make a comparison versus our guide.

And the next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI.

Stephen Kim
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Just to start off with, if we could get the spec numbers the finished and the under construction specs at the end of the quarter and also a clarification on your community count comment. Think you said 2Q was going to be the high watermark. I just want to make sure that we're clear that you're saying that the community count will actually be highest in 2Q and then it will descend from there.

Robert Dillard
CFO & EVP

The community cadence in cost.

Rob McGibney
President & COO

Okay. So -- Steve, as we're looking at the setup for the year, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we ended the quarter with 271. We're on an upward trajectory for that. We do expect to hit the peak for community count for the year kind of right in the heart of the spring selling season right in the middle of Q2 and be up from that 271. We're not pinpointing a number, but we think we'll be up somewhere between 9 to 13 communities from that number by the time. And by the time we get right into the middle of that second quarter. So that's driving some of our assumptions on the -- and projections on the deliveries for the year. As far as the inventory levels, we've got about 1,700 homes in inventory right now across the company, and those are inventory that we're expecting to cover here over the next few months.

Stephen Kim
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. That's total, right? Total inventory, not necessarily finished inventories, is that right? Like just trying to get a sense how much is finished and how much is under construction.

Rob McGibney
President & COO

Well, since we haven't been starting -- haven't been starting specs, we've seen some of that shift out of the under construction. So love the 1,700, we've got a little over 1,000 that are at or near the finish stage.

Stephen Kim
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. Got you. That's helpful. And then a general question about your community -- I'm sorry, your shift to BTO. What you're describing is that you have a number of new communities that are going to be opening up and that will really facilitate your transition to more BTO sales, which are also higher margin? And I guess, it would be helpful for me to understand what is it about a new community that necessarily makes it easier for you to make a shift in your BTO strategy. Because to a degree, I would think that most of your -- pretty much all of your communities were initially designed around the BTO concept and sort of market reality sort of kind of pushed you to do a little bit more spec than you would normally like. So that's my perception. Is that an incorrect perception? Do you actually have communities that you kind of just earmarked the kind of spec communities and just not doing any of those as we go forward. Just if you can help me understand what -- how the transition is facilitated by a new community opening up per se?

Rob McGibney
President & COO

Yes,. Let me go back up top and start with when we got into starting specs, it was largely driven by the supply chain crunch that we had and our cycle times have expanded big time and it just made it difficult for a lot of reasons to sell BTO when it was taking 220 days, 240 days to deliver that home. So that, combined with virtually no inventory in the market. And then as we've worked through this process, it's been difficult to get off of that, and we draw a hard line in the sand earlier this year or in 2025. And as I look at it, I think a core strength of our company is the ability to sell the advantage of the build-to-order model. And frankly, we created an internal conflict with ourselves with those specs that we started. And in a lot of ways, we've been competing with ourselves to some extent. And with our BTO program, with our build times, we're now building in less than 120 days. So that competes much better with the time line for resales and spec homes. And we're giving our customers the ability to lock the loan and leverage the onetime float down in the event that mortgage rates decline. So it's really what's driving the improvement is sharper alignment around our build-to-order model and just execution and driving that discipline and consistency in how our teams position our value with the great base price and transparency and the ability to personalize. And our focus is really reinforcing the importance of selling the home through the customers' eyes and helping them understand the trade-offs and the cost certainty and the long-term value of getting exactly what they want rather than pushing that spec solution. So it's -- I would characterize this as less of a change in strategy is more stronger execution against a proven business model that we've operated with for a long time. And when our sales teams fully believe in and consistently sell the benefits of that build-to-order, the results follow. And with these new communities, we don't have specs to compete with at all, and we're quickly working through the specs in our existing communities where it's creating that competition.

Our next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates.

Alan Ratner
Zelman & Associates LLC

Thanks for all the details so far. I was hoping to get an update on kind of your pricing strategy shift. I know you're obviously focusing on increasing the BTO mix. And I guess, part of that or in addition to that, I know a few quarters ago, you mentioned kind of the push to get towards more of a base price model as opposed to the kind of the kitchen sink incentive model that a lot of your competitors are operating with. And it seems like since then, if anything, the incentive environment has gotten even more competitive. I mean, we're seeing rate buydowns advertised on a lot of the builder websites 2%, 3%. So I'm just curious, A, how has it been competing in this environment with your new strategy? And B, do you have an update on kind of what the actual base price adjustments that you've seen up to this point and what the expectation is going forward?

Rob McGibney
President & COO

Yes. So there's really not much to report on the price change front. I mean, overall, it was a relatively stable quarter for us in terms of pricing and as Jeff said in the beginning, and we said last quarter, we were -- we've been disciplined and didn't chase volume during what was typically a lower demand environment and more inelastic. So not a lot of change on the price front. I expect that, that will probably change as we get here deeper into Q1 and into the selling season. But -- so far, what we've seen, especially in communities where we've worked down the level of specs we have, and we're not competing with ourselves. We've seen our mix shift trend more towards BTO. And in November, we saw that move into the mid- to high 50s. December, we don't have a lot of data to go off of in December. We've only had one full week of reported sales so far. But so far, we've seen that shift up into the 60s. So we like the trend that we're seeing and expect that's going to result in higher margins over time.

Alan Ratner
Zelman & Associates LLC

Got it. And that was kind of the -- the second question I was going to ask on that improvement or increase in BTO you've seen. Is there something you can attribute the increase you've seen recently to? Is that a function of maybe the overall inventory environment kind of improving across the industry? We've heard from a lot of your spec-focused peers like they pulled back a lot on starts over the last handful of months. So are you actually seeing a little bit of relief on the spec competition side? Or is it more something you're doing internally that's driven that recent mix shift?

Jeffrey Mezger
Chairman & CEO

Alan, one of the things that got blurred with what Rob walked through on the supply chain crunch and then the inventory that we put in and others put in is you lose sight of the value in the build-to-order approach. And don't underestimate the benefit of many of our divisions now building in less than 100 days. So would you rather have a completed spec with a lot of incentives to move it or do you want to build your own home and create your own value and close 30 days later or 45 days later. So what we're seeing is with our build times coming down, the value proposition of the personalized home at an attractive price is more compelling. So we don't think that our customers are competing with the specs. We focus on resale and we offer a brand-new home that's within range of the refill median, and they really value the personalization. So it's naturally coming back to us because we're prioritizing it and focusing on much better than we did in the last couple of years.

Our next question comes from the line of Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America.

Rafe Jadrosich
BofA Securities, Research Division

I just wanted to kind of follow up on some of the comments on the BTO mix. I think you said 57% of deliveries for BTO in the fourth quarter. How are you expecting for the fiscal first quarter? And then what would that be for the full year kind of at the midpoint of guidance? Wondering sort of where the exit rate will be for the year compared to that 70% target you have?

Rob McGibney
President & COO

Yes. That's a good question. I mean in the first quarter, I expect that we are going to continue covering some of that inventory. So the ratio is going to be tilted more so towards probably that 57% to 60% range. The exit rate, I think, is what's more important. And we're very focused on getting back to at least a 70-30 ratio, and we see that a great opportunity to drive that change. With the new communities we've got coming with the onset of the spring selling season as we work the built-to-order model and could go that route. We expect that we'll exit at that rate, and it will be kind of a gradual progression to get there through the first couple of quarters of the year.

Rafe Jadrosich
BofA Securities, Research Division

Great. So similar mix in fiscal first quarter versus the fourth quarter?

Rob McGibney
President & COO

Most likely, yes.

Rafe Jadrosich
BofA Securities, Research Division

And then just the fiscal -- the first quarter gross margin, the quarter-over-quarter decline, you spoke about the fixed cost deleverage and the amount that you're getting pressured there. But the decline is sort of greater than that. What are the other pieces to sort of bridge us to the first quarter decline?

Rob McGibney
President & COO

It's outside of the leverage piece, it's just largely driven by regional and product mix within our cities, combined with some pricing pressure on moving the inventory. As Jeff mentioned, we've got this tale of inventory that we're working through that has higher direct cost and a lower margin, and that's going to -- that bled into the deliveries and will continue in the short term. Overall, with the higher-margin BTO sales becoming a larger percentage of our deliveries and the improved leverage that we'll get on fixed as we move throughout 2026. We expect Q1 to be the bottom in margins, and we're going to go up from there.

Our next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.

Michael Dahl
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

One more on the BTO dynamic. I guess, look, if you [ op ] your spec starts, it's pretty easy to mathematically move your mix of BTO up. So I'm trying to understand in context your order pace was light. So as you go into next year, you have a view that you can kind of manage this transition and the demand will be there. What are you willing to tolerate on kind of pace to force the issue versus just if you get into the spring selling season, the demand responses and they are kind of pivoting back to spec? I guess and anything you can give us on -- aside from just percentage mix, maybe like some sales pace stats on some of the newer communities that are more BTO versus some of the spec communities. Just looking for a little more color there.

Jeffrey Mezger
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Mike, there's a few factors in the response. One, every community is a different story. And while Rob was sharing the mix shift we're seeing to BTO, it's not just on the brand-new community. Some communities had little inventory and has sustained the mix and others had more than they should have, and we're solely working through that. But it's working across the system. And I've shared on past calls, we keep walking through the optimize the asset approach. And for our company, it seems to -- you get the best returns of doing at least 4 a month on average per community. Our sales pace in the fourth quarter would seasonally adjust to 4 a month. So we were on the 4 a month pace in the quarter. As we look ahead into the spring selling season, our intent is to support our sales rate with build-to-order sales more so than forcing the inventory. And in part, we like it because we know what the margin is when we start the home. And you can fool yourself with a spec start in the thinking you're going to make this margin and then lo and behold 5 months later, it's down 4 or 5 points. So we would rather pull the levers on a build-to-order approach in the spring per community and ensure that we hold to that 4 a month pace.

Michael Dahl
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. My second question, look, I appreciate the dynamics at play with the margin between seasonality and the spec dynamic that you expect to work past as the year goes on. If we look at the 1Q operating margin guidance, it is low single digits, which if we think about normal distribution, there would presumably be some healthy number of communities that were kind of breakeven or below. So my question is really around your impairment process and testing. And I know there's a component that's probably duration and your projections about BTO. Hypothetically, if you were to sustain these types of margins in kind of the mid-teens, what are the set of assumptions that would be required where -- to make the charge -- I mean $14 million in charge is still kind of nominal this quarter? What would lead you to take kind of I guess, for lack of better word, much larger charges because it seems like this is getting closer to where some land might be impaired?

Jeffrey Mezger
Chairman & CEO

Mike, I'll say a few things, and I'll hand it to Rob Dillard. We've already shared that the first quarter margins are in the low watermark, and we expect improvement quarter-over-quarter as the year progresses from there. And it's a combination of better leverage as we grow revenue back and better margins as our community mix rotates around. I can say we've had the same impairment process for years and years. It's very rigorous. Every community is analyzed every quarter. And it starts with what's the margin in the community and you have a positive margin or not. And even at today's margin, there's a significant gap before any kind of major impairments would get triggered. And when you throw out that number on impairments, keep in mind, half of it was abandonments on communities we elected not to go forward with. So it's not a reflection of a margin. It's a reflection of a community we decided not to go close on. I don't know if you want to say anything else?

Robert Dillard
CFO & EVP

Yes. I mean just to concur with what Jeff said, I mean, the impairment process is incredibly rigorous and it is community by community, and it's pretty much actually a constant process that we're evaluating these communities and understanding what the trends are within the communities and the relative returns and profitability of the communities. We have a certain number of communities that kind of hit excess scrutiny and that list of communities is actually relatively limited. We did decide to take an impairment on 2 communities, one of which was relatively small as it was about to close out and then the other one was a community in our Central division in Colorado, where we had -- which was associated with the same issue, which is a change in some of the requirements on housing, which change the cost profile of those houses and led us to an impairment on those products. So we think that that's fully behind us now. So as we evaluate these impairments, there would have to be some kind of meaningful shift or a trigger that would change our perception of the community's profitability over time. And right now, we haven't seen that. And so I would also say that all of these profitability measures are fully loaded with corporate and everything else in there. And so that has an impact and those are also costs that we're evaluating as we go forward.

And the next question comes from the line of Trevor Allinson with Wolfe Research.

Trevor Allinson
Wolfe Research, LLC

First question on the ASP implied by the midpoint of your 2026 revenue deliveries guidance. I believe the midpoint in '26 is above your 4Q '25 ASP. Is the expectation to be able to increase prices in fiscal '26? Or are there mix impacts driving that? Just trying to understand what should the base case be for pricing to move higher versus where it was in 4Q?

Jeffrey Mezger
Chairman & CEO

Trevor, we're not assuming price. That is totally mixed. We have some very high-end communities in very good locations in California that are opening soon. In fact, one is already open and they'll be delivering pretty sizable number of homes in the third and fourth quarter. So our mix shift is going to trigger higher ASP as these higher-priced communities hit volume.

Trevor Allinson
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Makes sense. And then the second one is on returning cash to shareholders in fiscal '26. You gave the guide for 1Q. Typically, it's a smaller quarter for you guys. So should we think that you continue to return capital to shareholders at a similar $50 million to $100 million rate post 1Q? Or how are you thinking about that beyond the first quarter?

Jeffrey Mezger
Chairman & CEO

Well, we've demonstrated with our activity that we're programmatic now with the share buyback program. And we typically are a little lighter in the first quarter because of the cash position we're in at the end of the year, and we want to evaluate it as the spring comes. And it's a few factors that we evaluate not just our cash and balance sheet, but where is the stock price and do we have a lot of opportunity to grow the company. And that's one of the key areas that we want to continue to pursue as well. But I would say that as the quarters roll by the 50 to 100 a quarter is reasonable.

And our next question comes from the line of Jade Rahmani with KBW.

Jade Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

You mentioned transparency on price and emphasizing pricing over incentives. Are you seeing other builders follow suit in cutting price? And are you worried at all that this could lead to price wars in many locations?

Rob McGibney
President & COO

I really haven't seen it. I mean most of what we see is that builders are trying to cover their spec inventory that they've got, and it's kind of the same game. You've got inventory, you designed it, and it's out there and it may not be exactly what people want. So they're discounting that product and giving rate buydowns and everything else. We see very little competition with our build-to-order focus, especially on the first-time buyer space.

Jade Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

And then on the option walkaway charges, have you identified a pool of communities that you may not exercise additional options? And do you anticipate further charges through this year 2026?

Robert Dillard
CFO & EVP

That's just a normal part of our land procurement process that we have options, which are really just payments, earnest money or what have you as we go through the process and execute due diligence. And sometimes we decide to proceed and sometimes we don't. And I think that we're holding the line with really stringent underwriting standards, and we're ensuring that we're sticking to our strategy. And that's kind of led to maybe what is more than typical kind of abandonment, but it's not something that's indicative of us of a low quality or anything like that. We're pretty pleased with how that's progressing and think that, that's -- it's not a normal way thing that we expect to see in a really fulsome market, but it's a characteristic of this market.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Sam Reid with Wells Fargo.

Richard Reid
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just curious where incentive loads landed in the fourth quarter as a percent of revenues? And any sense as to what's embedded in the first quarter? And then kind of a knock on to that is talk to how you're incentivizing some of this aged inventory that you're selling through?

Rob McGibney
President & COO

So -- yes, I'm not sure I have a perfect answer for you on the incentive piece on Q4. I know that any mortgage concessions that we did, it was right around 1%. When we look at our book of business and the inventory that we've got, that's really the -- one of the few places we're applying any of those incentives at all. So most of that's coming through that side of it. As we look out through the balance of the year, we project that we're going to get even further away from that and incentive usage should come down even more.

Jeffrey Mezger
Chairman & CEO

Yes. There's no like unusual incentives. Like what you would read through our incentive disclosure is really more just the normal way incentive that we give, which is like closing cost assistance and things like that. There's nothing unusual and that equates to just 1% or 2% typically.

Richard Reid
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

That helps. And then this is perhaps more of a follow-up to some of the prior questions. But when you look at your range of delivery volume outcomes in '26, it's pretty wide. The question really is, is there a different assumption for spec versus build-to-order embedded at the high end of that delivery volume range versus the low end. And then, I mean, would it be fair to assume that the low end of that range is just a scenario where build-to-order doesn't come in as planned. Would just love some context on that.

Rob McGibney
President & COO

Yes. We're really focused on driving the build-to-order sales, as we said. And the range is driven by -- we're in December right now. We've got the spring selling season in front of us. We've got a lot of communities open. But -- we just don't have great visibility into what the spring might be. I'd say that the 2025 spring selling season was a disappointment, and we baked our -- where we've made our -- prepared our plan and our strategy for the year around what I would consider a normal spring selling season with that community count growth, maybe even slightly below average. As we piece it all together, we're only counting on needing to drive about just slightly over 4 build-to-order sales per community in the first half of the year. And as we look at the past years, to get us to the midpoint of our delivery range. And when we look at past years, it seems like that should be relatively easy to do. If we're better than that, and we have a spring selling season like we saw a couple of years ago than we'll probably hit the high end, but we just don't know yet.

Operator

And our final question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.

Andrew Azzi
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

You have Andrew Azzi here on for Mike. Just wanted to drill down. I believe you guys said traffic was relatively stable within the quarter. Was there any meaningful difference in sales trends month-to-month? Or was it more of the same?

Jeffrey Mezger
Chairman & CEO

Well, month to month, I mean September was our strongest month and we see that almost every year, and then it ticks down in October and November. So this year followed that typical seasonal pattern that we did that we saw. Traffic has held stay. Our conversion has actually improved a little. So we're focused on driving more traffic. It's just challenging to do in November and December. So...

Andrew Azzi
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. I appreciate that. And then maybe within 1Q's gross margin and even as we go throughout the year, what are kind of your assumptions for construction costs and lot costs within your guide in 1Q and maybe your outlook for the year?

Robert Dillard
CFO & EVP

Yes. I mean we're not expecting a meaningful change in construction or lot costs. I mean we do feel really good that we've kind of bent the curve a little bit on unit costs in the sense that direct construction costs and material costs, we've been able to offset the lot cost inflation. And sequentially the year-over-year change in lot cost has gone -- went down pretty meaningfully from third quarter to fourth quarter. And so we feel like we're getting to a better position there in terms of being able to draw some profitability off of our cost savings initiatives. But we don't have like a specific guide on lot cost change that we would give you at this point. Yes, it's baked in.
