Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jon Braatz with Oppenheimer.

Jonathan Braatz
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

A couple of questions. David, when you spoke a little bit about the December comps. You mentioned some issues in Honduras and Panama in the supply chain. Specifically, when you look at Honduras and Panama, were the comps positive despite these issues in the month of December?

David Price
CEO & Director

We usually don't share that level of detail, Jon, in terms of country by country, so I want to make sure I'm consistent. But in Honduras with the election, there was some front-loading of purchasing in November leading up to the election, and we've seen a good recovery now that there's been an outcome of the election and a definitive President. And in Panama, we're well into the dry season and seeing okay results there as well. But I can't share that level of granularity with you.

Jonathan Braatz
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Okay. So those -- basically, those issues that you saw are behind you at this point?

David Price
CEO & Director

Yes.

Jonathan Braatz
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Okay. Okay. Good. And can you speak a little bit about Colombia. Colombia has been very strong for the last year, maybe even more than a year, comps have been well into the double-digit area. Anything you can put your finger on as to the strength there?

David Price
CEO & Director

Sure. Thanks for the question. So a couple of different things. I mean, both kind of internal and external factors, starting with the external, I think that the strength of the peso certainly helps. The merchandise mix there, we have more local items than in other markets. But the -- when things are -- when we're under COP 4,000 to $1 on the peso, that definitely helps not only purchasing power but also consumer sentiment. I think confidence in the market from the consumer standpoint.

In addition, I have to just give credit to the team. We have an excellent team, both in buying and operations there, and it's really -- there's some great items coming out of Colombia, even some that we're starting to export to other markets. So the item development, both locally and then in terms of the imports also is driving nice differentiation.

Jonathan Braatz
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

I know it's -- you spoke a little bit about the issues in Venezuela. And are there -- what kind of problems might Colombia face if there is sort of a migration and from Venezuela -- additional migrations from Venezuela to Colombia, does that put economic pressure? What kind of economic pressure might that place on Colombia? David?

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator. I apologize, but there will be a slight delay in today's conference. Please hold, and the call will resume momentarily. Thank you for your patience. [Technical Difficulty]

Mr. Braatz , your line is open.

Jonathan Braatz
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

David, I was just going to ask you all the issues that we're seeing in Venezuela. Could some of -- could there be pressure on the Colombian economy if there's more migration of people from Venezuela to Colombia. Can that put any pressure on the economy?.

David Price
CEO & Director

It's -- I don't want to speculate, Jon. The diaspora has been going on for a long time. And there's been Venezuelan migration all over the region. And so I want to be careful not to speculate on something I really don't have any data to share on. But from what we're seeing, consumer demand is strong in Colombia, and we have a good brand position.

Jonathan Braatz
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Okay. And 1 last question. If I saw it correctly, at the end of fiscal 2025 you had about USD 60 million in Colombia -- in Trinidad. And at the end of the first quarter, you have $80 million. why the increase from $60 million to $80 million in the first quarter?

Gualberto Hernandez
Executive VP & CFO

Jon, this is Gualberto. Thank you for the question. Trinidad, as you know, is something we're looking careful and there is a lot of fluctuations in the availability of U.S. dollars. There is no specific reason. It's a little bit of high season now after Christmas. So there is more cash on our side. And it's a bit more difficult to cover everything. But we don't see any material changes in the conditions there. It continues to be difficult, I wouldn't say it's more difficult than before, and it just fluctuates depending on the availability of dollars, as you know, in the market in every month. Nothing in particular to highlight there.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Hector Maya with Scotiabank.

Héctor Maya López
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

On Chile, very quick, it is really nice to hear that you are moving quick on certain important steps, usually, permits tend to be -- tend to take a bit of time. So that is nice to hear. But what have you learned so far from the market or potential competition, and are there any surprises or takeaways or things that you are not expecting maybe in Chile? And on Colombia, with a good momentum there, how sustainable do you think is the revenue growth that we are seeing in the country? And how concerned are you about the minimum wage hikes in the country? Or what effect do you expect from that?

David Price
CEO & Director

Okay. Let me take the first 1 with Chile. I wouldn't say there's anything necessarily that has surprised us. But I will say, Chile, of course, is a very competitive market and highly digitalized with a high expectation from the consumer.

It's also very open from the standpoint of free trade agreements. And so there are a lot of imports as well. There are no club models in Chile. There are Mayorista models, as you know, that are kind of more like the Atacadao kind of Brazil type wholesale model, but nobody doing what we do. So we operate in other competitive markets, and so we feel optimistic.

And in terms of Colombia, in terms of minimum wage. I don't want to comment on -- in terms of -- there's a sovereign country making its own policy decisions, but we don't have any sort of issue there because we aim to pay a living wage in every market and pay above minimum wage, where that doesn't align with the living wage. And so that's kind of our approach, and we want to be -- have our pay and compensation benefits be 1 of the differentiators from the standpoint of who we employ.

I mean that's a really important part of our philosophy as a business being an employer of choice. And so I don't anticipate any issue in Colombia as a result of that. And in terms of future looking, I can't comment on future growth. But as I mentioned to John, we're feeling confident in terms of our results in Colombia and the brand position in the market as well as our product mix and what we're able to offer.

Gualberto Hernandez
Executive VP & CFO

Absolutely. I mean to complement that, our operations in Colombia and growing more and more efficient. So we're confident on our abilities to be successful and to have the right to win in the market. But as you, of course, understand there are a lot of macroeconomic and political elements that we don't control.

Héctor Maya López
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Excellent, excellent to hear. Also on warehouse and parking expansions and remodeling just how much opportunity or boost in operations are you expecting from this by country or by region? And where do you see the most potential here?

David Price
CEO & Director

Well, I can't share by region or by country or club, but I can tell you that when we do warehouse expansions, remodels or parking expansions, it helps on several fronts. I mean, first and foremost, it's helping our members. In the case of the parking, we have the good problem of having busy locations. And so when we offer more parking, it helps our members get in and out quicker, but also enables us if there's better flow to turn spaces a little faster, which can help.

And then in terms of the sales floor, it helps from an efficiency standpoint, and then, of course, also in terms of selling pilot positions, which is helpful as well, both in terms of items, but also in terms of show stock and availability on the floor. So I can't mention beyond that but there are various factors that drive where we select to do this and also how it impacts. And so far, we've been happy with the results where we pursued remodels and the parking lot expansions

Héctor Maya López
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
