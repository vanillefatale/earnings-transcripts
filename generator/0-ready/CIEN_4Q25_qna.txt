[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ruben Roy with Stifel.

Ruben Roy
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Congratulations, Gary and Marc, just great to see the progress here. So the first question, Marc, when we think about the guidance and the raise, Gary talked about, some of the new use cases and more hyperscalers looking at either scale across or also discussions around DCOM with other hyperscalers. How much of that is in the new guidance versus just continued sort of growth across the existing relationships that you have?

And then the second question for Gary is just thinking about the new scale across opportunities, Gary, you gave us some metrics around the first wins in terms of either revenue or bandwidth and bandwidth measured in petabyte. Are the discussions that you're having in the wins with the new hyperscaler similar? Or if you could maybe give us a little more detail on those, that would be great.

Marc Graff
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Ruben, this is Marc. Thanks for joining. In terms of how much of the new opportunities that Gary talked about are in the guide, they are all in the guide. If you think about the in and around data center, which many of the wins that Gary talked about include, we're seeing nearly a tripling of the percent of revenue from what we saw in 2025 of low single digits to the percent of revenue that we have in 2026's guide of low double digits.

And so I think we've captured a lot of that. Obviously, we're continuing to work to satisfy all that demand. But you've seen -- it's all included in there, short answer.

Gary Smith
CEO, President & Director

Ruben, to the second question around the sort of models around the across piece. First of all, I'd say, they're obviously -- all of these hyperscalers are not sort of homogeneous around their business models and therefore, their network requirements reflect that. So they are different, notwithstanding, they all need to train.

So what we're seeing with the initial hyperscaler is obviously just expanding the amount of sites, and that will happen over multiple years. We've had 2 other hyperscalers now adopt our architecture. So we've got 3 out of the 4 hyperscalers have selected us for their scale across training models.

In terms of how -- quantifying how much they are, they are clearly hundreds of millions each but they are different in terms of their scale at this stage. But really, that's just -- we're just beginning to see the traffic come out of the data center for training around these regional backbones or clusters. We're just beginning to see that. And I don't think there's going to be a cookie style sort of quantification of the traffic at this point.

The next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.

Simon Leopold
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

I wanted to maybe expand a bit on the scale across outlook in particular. So you've gotten these 2 additionals that certainly earlier than we were expecting. I want to see if you can give us maybe a time line of when you would expect those 2 other hyperscalers to really kick into the numbers, how imminent that is?

And then maybe you could talk about sort of a longer-term cadence of scale across activity? Because I think when you first disclosed it, you talked about the initial customer, perhaps having opportunities of 8 or 9 kind of projects. So now that we see additional hyperscalers entering the fray, how would you look at it more broadly over the multiyear number of projects? That's question #1.

Question #2 is hopefully the easiest one you'll get today. But if you could just break up the 10% disclosures, you said 2 cloud and an operator, if you can give us the detail that will ultimately be in your SEC filings. But if we could break that down, I'd appreciate it.

Gary Smith
CEO, President & Director

Simon, let me take the first part of that. In summary, I would expect us to take revenue for all 3 of these hyperscalers in '26 or begin to take revenue in '26. I think the large part of this is going to be scaling up in '27 and through '28.

I mean these are enormous amounts of scale and commitments around massive amounts of fiber between these data centers, which takes time from an infrastructure point of view. I believe we'll take revenue on all 3 during the course of this year. But Simon, I really see the ramp on this as we get to '27 and through '28. I mean this is going to be the backbone for these training models. I would also say, at this stage, it is all U.S. centric around the training models as well.

Marc Graff
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So Simon, let me hit your second question. The 3 plus 10% customers that we had in Q4, one was AT&T, you'll see that in the K. The other 2 we're not being specific on who they were. But collectively, for Q4, those 3 covered just under 44% of Q4's revenue.

And then for the full year, it was one cloud provider and one service provider that collectively -- and it was AT&T as a service provider. Collectively, for the year, they covered about 28% of our revenue.

Simon Leopold
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Yes. Can you give us that split? So what each one was within that 44% in the quarter?

Marc Graff
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, I'll have to get back to you, Simon. I don't have that specific in front of me.

The next question comes from Atif Malik with Citi.

Atif Malik
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Great job by the team. First one for Gary. Gary, on Nubis, in September, you talked about in the second half of '26 and early '27 adoption for CPO, NPO type products. Are you seeing an acceleration over there?

Gary Smith
CEO, President & Director

I would say that, yes, we're engaged with multiple opportunities with them. Obviously, we're waiting for first GA product, but we have a lot of market engagement, even prior to our acquisition with them, I would say that what we've seen since -- and this is early days, we only did the acquisition last quarter, but I think we've seen sort of accelerated interest now that they're part of a broader company. Scott, do you want to?

Scott McFeely
Executive Advisor

Yes, just to remind you, they're sort of at a high level, two product families within Nubis portfolio, one is a linear retimer that is very effective in terms of extending the life of active copper cable. And we see that as an opportunity that will start in '26. The optical part of the portfolio, the second part of the portfolio, we see more as a '27 and beyond opportunity. But as Gary said, we're getting great feedback from customers on a bunch of different dimensions. First of all, the sort of open ecosystem approach to CPO.

Secondly, just the caliber of the team. And then I'd say more an internal reaction. And we -- one of the big things -- one of the big filters as we looked at this company was did we think they are a good cultural fit. And I'd say, 90 days in, we're absolutely thrilled with that.

Atif Malik
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Great. And as my follow-up, Marc, a nice debut on gross margins and keeping OpEx discipline. You have talked about advantages from bringing lasers in-house. I'm wondering what else is driving sustainable outlook for operating margins of 17%?

Marc Graff
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So there's a couple of things that I would say. The first is one of the big things that we're working on in the first half of the year is ramping our 800-gig pluggables. And so as we ramp that, you basically get yield economics, which will lower the unit costs over time. And we expect that as we go through Q2, Q3, Q4, we'll see significantly lower cost than we're seeing at the beginning of the year. So that would be the first aspect that I would say.

The second aspect is the conversations that we've had with a lot of our customers have yielded good results. And so once we get through the backlog that we're entering the year with, a lot of those new orders will start to see the benefits of those pricing discussions. And so we would exit the year at a higher entry -- higher exit rate than we feel that we'll see in the first half of the year.

Operator

The next question comes from George Notter with Wolfe Research.

George Notter
Wolfe Research, LLC

It seems like there's just obviously tons and tons of demand here. Could you give us more on what you're doing on the supply side of things. Just curious like what do you see as the supply constraints in the business? Is it fabing chips? Is it contract manufacturing? Like anything you can tell us on what those bottlenecks are and what you're doing to open those up would be great.

Marc Graff
Senior VP & CFO

George, it's Marc. I'll start and then hand it over to Gary and Scott for more color. So a couple of things. You heard me talk about a pretty nice increase in our CapEx year-on-year. And within that, there's about a 50% increase in what we're doing to ensure that we could have more capacity to support what will really be end of year and into 2027 demand.

But what we're seeing is really a constraint on the photonics parts, right? And I would say optical parts in general. And we've worked really closely with our key suppliers, and I know you know who those are to make sure that we can secure supply. And the investments that we've made in 2025 actually yielded a doubling of the growth rate from what we expected a year ago, right? And so between that the level of vertical integration that we've got in just what we control as well as the investments that we're making in 2027, we're trying to support as much of that revenue as we possibly can through '26 and into '27.

Scott McFeely
Executive Advisor

And Marc, I'd add to that in terms of the constraints you talked about in terms of the industry optical component subsegment, if you like, an advantage that we have, there's a couple of advantages that we have, I think, relative to other peers. Number one is, we have a very tight relationship with the cloud providers. We have market share leadership there and a great set of relationships.

So even though the demand outstripped what everybody expected. I think we had the earliest view of that in the industry. And therefore, our conversations with those industry component suppliers started earlier than everybody else. So that gave us that gave us a benefit. The other thing is, as we've talked about in the past, we're more vertically integrated than anybody else. So to some degree, we do have a little bit more control of our own destiny.

And part of the reason why in the last 90 days, we've been able to take 2026 out is the activity that we did in '25 that allowed us to double our growth perspective in '25 is carrying over into '26. So we're getting more confident in our ability to deliver to that demand as well.

George Notter
Wolfe Research, LLC

Got it. And then one last one. What are lead times right now? Any sense for kind of what blended or average lead times would look like for you guys?

Gary Smith
CEO, President & Director

This is Gary. It really varies by specific product areas. I mean, they're all generally in the optical infrastructure base, so sort of think scale across RLS, they have extended out, but it depends on the product grouping. What we're working on within -- as Marc and Scott said, we're confident -- if you look at the midpoint of our guide, which is what, 24% growth for this year. So that's the work, as Scott said, we did kind of last year to increase capacity and component supply.

We're now working on towards the end of '26 and '27 and making sure that we're in a good position from that point of view. So hopefully by the time we get to the end of year, we get to '27, lead times can come down a little. But we're seeing increase in demand, including order flows in Q1 being strong as well.

The next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America.

Tal Liani
BofA Securities, Research Division

I have 3 questions. The first one is the sort of perspective. You guided before to 8% growth. And that -- you increased it multiple times, and now you're guiding for 30% growth for next quarter. That's a massive change. So you didn't have good visibility before for the growth. And the question I'm asking myself is, do you have now good visibility going forward? So can you take us through the historical perspective, meaning what happened over the last 4 or 5 quarters that drove up the growth so much better than expectations. And you spoke a little bit about customer concentration, but what kind -- what happened that enabled this kind of growth? Maybe I'll stop here and then I'll ask my other questions after because they're more on the margin side.

Marc Graff
Senior VP & CFO

Tal, it's Marc. I'll start and Gary can add in here. I think there's really a couple of dynamics that's going on. One is the close proximity that we have with our hyperscaler customers has really allowed us to get insight into what their demands are and how we plan for those demands. And they followed that demand up with pretty significant orders, right?

So I mean, you heard Gary talk about we achieved $7.8 billion of orders over 2025. As we look at what we're seeing in Q1, we're essentially sold out, right? If we had more supply, we'd be able to sell more. And so we've got really good visibility of what the next several quarters look like just because we've got those orders in place.

And then the last thing I'll say before Gary can chime in, is through 2025, I think our supply chain team has done quite a good job of squeezing every drop of blood from the stone that they can to drive that revenue. We're investing -- we invested in 2025. We're increasing that investment by about 50% through 2026, and we're seeing those annualization layers kind of help us drive higher revenue that for the year, we expect a midpoint growth of 24%. I don't know, Gary, if you have anything to add?

Gary Smith
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Tal, I would say sort of zooming out from this sort of big picture. I think everything Marc said that we've -- I think we've done a good job operationally of scaling it up quickly. I would say that what's behind that really with the cloud guys, just in general, is that I think early in the year there at the beginning of '25 as we're going to get through it was a realization that their networks needed to be scaled massively.

And now if you think about the sort of hierarchy of flow around long poles in the tent and focus areas, obviously, there's been tremendous focus in the context of AI infrastructure around GPUs, TPUs and getting access and scaling those up, power within the data centers, et cetera. I think you began to then see the network.

And that coincided with the need for backbone networks to train across multiple data centers and the increase they were seeing in inference traffic. Obviously, this is unchartered territory from a forecasting of a network perspective. But I think they're now coming up to speed very quickly that it's now about the network as the gating item. And I think there was a real realization of that in the first part of '25, and you're seeing that play through now. So that's the sort of context that I would offer on that.

Scott McFeely
Executive Advisor

And Tal, within that, if you go back a year or 18 months, we talked quite a bit about our belief system of optics and particularly Coherent optics having a bigger and bigger role to play in the network inside and around the data center. And what we weren't sure of though, and we were overt about this, what we weren't sure about is the timing of when you see that inflection point. What's happened in that period is with the scale across network is you're seeing that inflection point, new use cases for Coherent optical high-speed connectivity.

Tal Liani
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. My second question is on margins. In previous cycles, your margins shot up all the way to even 49%, even over 50%, if we go back a few years and cycles always had a direct impact on gross margin, like you always had a cycle in margin as well. This time, because it's coming in pluggables, because it's coming in cloud, your margins are 43%, you're guiding to 43%, 43.5%. And the question is, is there a chance that the margin will also have a -- gross margin will also have a cycle with revenues or what needs to happen for the gross margin to have a similar cycle to revenues?

Marc Graff
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I think how I'd respond, Tal, is there's a couple of headwinds that we're seeing at least in the near term, and I've talked about the 800-gig. So we're in an NPI phase of that product. So that's creating some headwinds that we expect to kind of normalize out through the end of the year.

The other piece is I think the customers are starting to see the value in what we're providing, both in space savings and power savings. And we're getting some benefit from that relative to the value that we're delivering. So I think between those two things, we're seeing that. And my sense is that, that's going to be more sustainable than the cyclicality that we've seen in the past because we're really starting to talk about foundation level of benefit that our customers are seeing.

And as Gary said, they're realizing that they've underinvested in the network, both on the cloud provider side and the service providers are catching up as well. And so I think we're going to see steady improvement to what we've described previously as our aspiration to get back to the mid-40s which at this point, we kind of view as a way point, not the end game. So I think we're on a steady track. You'll see sequential improvement. We'll exit the year better than we will perform in the first half of the year, but I'm pretty confident that we're going to see ongoing multiyear gross margin expansion.

Next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.

Samik Chatterjee
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Maybe for the first one, I had a question on scale across. And Gary, you mentioned the additional engagement with hyperscalers. Are you seeing any engagements yet from the neo clouds on that front? Or would you expect most of that neo cloud demand for scale across to come through the hyperscalers itself? And can you help us think about margin implications for scale across relative to like there's a heavy mix of client systems as well as capacity. So how should we think about margin implication of scale across ramping here relative to your corporate average? And I have a quick follow-up.

Gary Smith
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I think largely at this stage, the training at scale across AI backbones is largely a purview of the large hyperscalers. And I think the neoscalers, there's a couple of them that are using the -- they're on the back of that for one of a better description. So I think it's -- this is largely right now given the -- frankly the scale of it with the hyperscalers and I don't see that. I think it's going to take a while for that to bleed through into the neoscalers.

In terms of the deployment there. As Marc said, it's going to be this combination of next-generation line systems, RLS, which is also fairly recent into market and also with the 800-gig plugs as well. So yes, in the early stages, that's a sort of headwind from a margin point of view, which is why we're kind of guiding as we are. But as that -- as those platforms get more into volume, the yields improve and we get through that NPI phrase on both of those, then we'd have better margins as we exit the year. And of course, you've also got the benefits of just scale and volume as well.

Samik Chatterjee
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And just for my follow-up. I mean, clearly, FY '26 is your guide is largely covered by the backlog. When you look at now sort of the long-term guide that you have provided of 8% to 11% growth, like how -- what level of visibility are you getting from your customers about fiscal '27? Are they sort of giving you more detailed plans for the out year just so that you can pan out capacity? And does that sort of imply that your growth rate sort of stays above the 8% to 11% level in sort of the out year as well?

Marc Graff
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Samik, it's Marc. A couple of things. One is, when we talked about the longer-term guide last quarter, we kind of took those off the table just because in the medium term, we're not very good at calling the growth rates on the upside, right? So that 11% -- 8% to 11%, I think, is off the table. We're not really talking to 2027 at this point. But I would say, overall, maybe qualitatively, we feel very strong going into '26. We think a lot of that momentum continues into 2027. And the proof point there is really the increase that we've seen in our CapEx for capacity, which is up 50% year-on-year.

Gary Smith
CEO, President & Director

I think the other thing you could obviously extrapolate out, we're not sort of guiding into '27 right now. We're just starting '26. But clearly, the dynamics have changed here. And that's why I said this is a sort of -- '25 was a seminal year for us in this regard.

I mean I think you're seeing multiple scale across wins that -- they are -- by their very nature, they're going to be multiyear. So that gives us confidence in '27 and '28. The other thing I would say is that's really all the context of our optical WAN type business in and around the data center to it. We're making tremendous amounts of investments and progress on the other dimensions there sort of inside and around the data center, which are completely new markets for Ciena.

And the revenues to those are largely -- we're taking some now. We're making good progress, largely '27 and '28 plays and specifically, Coherent inside the data center. That's all additional revenue to us in addition to all the things we've talked about right now. So that gives us confidence in the multi-year dimension to this.

The next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays.

Timothy Long
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Two questions for me as well. First, Gary, follow on what you were just talking about. Could you maybe talk a little bit about DCOM and see if you can somewhat scale that for us and good news that it's expanded with Meta and being tested at others. Could this be a type of technology that would really accelerate that move inside the data center as it gives you kind of a beachfront?

And then second, on the telco side, I guess, the MOFN part and 5G currently, but tends to be a little bit more cyclical than probably what you're going to see from hyperscalers. How do you look about sustainability of that business over the next few years on the telco specifically side?

Gary Smith
CEO, President & Director

Yes. On the DCOM part of that, obviously, that was cocreated specifically with Meta over a period of time. And I think what we're seeing with that is the expansion of the opportunity within the data center piece to that. It saves power and space for them, which is absolutely critical. And we've seen an expansion even in '26. And you're talking hundreds of millions of dollars of this.

And as they refresh and build out new data centers, that's become part of their adopted architecture. So I think this, again, is going to be a multiyear opportunity within Meta. And I also think about these large hyperscalers really when you think now about the diversity of portfolio that we're dealing with them, they're really markets in their own right, given their size and scale. We're also, as you said, engaged deeply with 2 to 3 other hyperscalers around this kind of architecture. And I would expect to see wins during the course of the year and adoptions for additional cloud players for DCOM.

So -- and it gives us an entry point into the data center, together with Nubis, together with the scale across because that is actually -- even the scale across is actually installed inside the data center. So you put all those things together, and we're definitely under the tent here. And that's before the Nubis, which will start to deliver product in '26 and before the opportunity with Coherent inside the data center.

To your point on the telco piece, I think they've kind of been underinvested in transport, frankly, for the last 5 years, ever since COVID began. They didn't want to mess with their networks during COVID. Then you had the supply chain whiplash, and then you had this massive investment they all had to make in 5G, which largely has not yielded the financial returns that they anticipated. Now you're seeing, I think, a multiyear investment back into transport. They are largely underinvested in the networks. And I think whilst that's not at the rapid scale and growth rate of the cloud, I think it's nice, steady mid-digit kind of single-digit growth within the telco space. And I think that's quite sustainable.

What is amplifying though is the AI traffic for things like MOFN. And you saw last year, hundreds of millions of dollars of our telco business was, in fact, MOFN, specifically for hyperscalers. And you saw it, typically, we've seen it internationally. We're also seeing it now in North America ramp up as well. So you put those 2 things together, and I think that gives us confidence around that telco, which is half our business currently, having nice sustained growth rates, albeit lower than the cloud players.

One more question, please.

Operator

And that question will come from Ryan Koontz with Needham.

Ryan Koontz
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Gary, maybe you can just take a step back regarding your great growth you're seeing here in the cloud segment. How has your product mix changed over, say, the last 12 months? Obviously, a lot around scale across and RLS and DCI, where you're historically more of a long-haul and subsea player. Can you give us any kind of perspective there on the product mix?

Gary Smith
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I would say sort of we're laying more tracks at massive scale because it's -- than we would normally see. You've specifically seen that with scale across because they're laying the tracks down first. So the much higher proportion of line systems would be the initial take on that. Now that will then move to plugs. We're seeing, obviously, a very large ramp-up in our 800-gig plugs, which we think will be largely adopted amongst most of the hyperscalers. And that is a different mix than we've seen traditionally, and more intelligence on the line systems than also you've seen traditionally because given the massive scale that they're going to need to put in with multiple fibers across it, then you're going to need to increase the intelligence and the scalability of the line systems. Couple that with DCOM, which, frankly, was a very quickly emerged as a portfolio offering. That was not projected into the '26 plan when we did that in our 3-year planning piece. So the mix has changed quite a lot around that architecture.

Ryan Koontz
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Really helpful. And just a quick follow-up, if I could. Just around growth limiters outside of your control as it relates to fiber supply, permitting, labor and really putting these lanes in the ground. What kind of supply constraints are you seeing for the industry for your cloud customers?

Gary Smith
CEO, President & Director

I think large -- the relationship with the fiber providers, people at Corning, et cetera, is very tight amongst the cloud players and the service providers, particularly the wholesalers, people like Lumen who publicly talked about that. So I think there's a lot of commitment to scale capacity. So we're seeing that happen.

The other thing I would say is it's a real opportunity for us because we have the largest optical support and services organization in the world. And we are increasingly engaged with the deployment of these. In fact, our largest service customer last year was a cloud provider for the first time. And we're now providing multiple services across the hyperscalers, and we see that as an area of tremendous growth to help, to your point, facilitate the delivery of this infrastructure.
