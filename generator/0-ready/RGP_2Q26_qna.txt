Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird.

Mark Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Nice to talk to you, Roger, and welcome to the company. I'm wondering can you talk a little bit about or elaborate a little bit on the specific areas where you're seeing AI leading to some disintermediation with regards to finance and accounting roles. And I'm specifically interested in terms of how widespread is it at this point? How do you expect it to continue with specific roles and how you're adjusting to that?

Roger Carlile
President, CEO & Director

Sure. Good to meet you. And I'll let Bhadresh add, you've been here longer dealing with it than me. But I think we're seeing, for example, in operational accounting roles, things that are -- you can imagine through AI or automation are easiest to replicate and replace. And so that would be some of the roles that we see as most impacted by our clients' efforts in that regard in the AI and automation world. In terms of how widespread that is, I mean, I think it's -- my sense -- again, I'll ask Bhadresh to add as well.

My sense would be that it's -- like most of the things we hear about AI, there's a lot of activity going on. Those things that are internal like those processes are where AI and automation are having the earliest impacts but there's still a lot of spending and still a lot of activity that's not been realized or benefits not being realized by clients. So I think it remains to be seen how pervasive and how rapidly that occurs, but we are seeing that. And Bhadresh, add if you think there's something to that.

Bhadresh Patel
Chief Operating Officer

Thank you, Roger. And I think you're spot on. What we're seeing with clients and everyone is what I would say is experimenting with AI to see how -- what leverage they can get in their organization, especially in finance. As Roger said, the operational accounting roles, what I would call more transactional repeatable roles are getting replaced. However, what we're finding is that it's getting clients access to data quickly and analytics of the data quickly and informing their ability to get their business more efficient, but that is requiring more work, right, to go execute.

So we're not seeing that big windfall that everyone is expecting that AI is going to replace so many jobs. It is accelerating the ability for our finance organization and clients' finance organizations to provide insights to their segments in terms of performance, predictability, future trends and things like that, so people can take action on it.

Our clients are also seeing that. I think a lot of them have continued to invest. Some feel like they're overinvesting and not realizing the benefits. So we feel like, obviously, time will tell where this will land, but it's still in the early stages akin to in the early days of digital transformation where everyone is overspending until they normalize it.

The second part of this is as clients are understanding how to leverage AI for their organization, it's just not that AI is replacing jobs, it's also changing processes and how companies operate. So it's becoming a transformation initiative that should drive our ability to provide more services requiring higher talented people that can understand about the impact of AI and what AI can do and then how that business operates and changes the way they work, not only within the function, but the interactions with other functions.

Roger Carlile
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Bhadresh. I just want to add one thing. I think the second part of your question was what are we doing about it? I mentioned in our comments that our talent teams and our On-Demand teams are working with clients to understand what skills they need in that environment because Bhadresh said, there's certain skills and projects that are caused because of that work.

And there are certain skills that are needed because of the technology being a major driver of that. So as we mentioned in our script, ERP skills, other kinds of technology skills. So we're looking to shift our skill base towards the things that clients most need in this environment.

Bhadresh Patel
Chief Operating Officer

Yes. And Roger, to add to that, I think what's becoming inherently clear is that the higher-level skills that we are staffing in the On-Demand business, what clients are seeking is that they are also becoming AI experts or AI knowledgeable for that particular function or particular role, and that's becoming critical.

I think on the consulting side, what we're seeing is that as clients are taking on these AI initiatives, data authenticity and accuracy is becoming a bigger issue, right, which is leading to bigger data projects for data cleanup and data tagging and things like that. So that's where a lot of focus is coming up in order for them to realize the pure benefits of AI as they look at end-to-end implementation of it.

Mark Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Just to elaborate a little bit, can you just -- like you have a fairly broad swath of the Fortune 500 that you serve. How widespread is what you're currently seeing? And then can you be a little bit more precise with regards to the types of roles? Are we talking about just accounts receivables and payables, reconciliations, data entry? Or because historically, you've also supplied people that were providing some analytical capabilities as well. And so I'm trying to understand to what extent are these lower-level roles rather than also impacting higher-level roles.

Bhadresh Patel
Chief Operating Officer

Yes. I mean the lower-level roles are definitely getting impacted, right, because AI is able to do those analysis and things like that as you leverage learning models to do that. In the higher-level roles, we don't see it as an impact. What we're seeing is a skill reconciliation is what I will say or skill evolution.

And says we're providing, for example, a controller or anything like that or in a senior financial analyst in these types of roles, they are looking for those that actually understand AI, know how to use AI and know how to implement AI to leverage it more. And that's, I think, the distinction we're seeing in [ assessing of ] reconciliation, receivables, all those types of things are the evolution of RPA into AI. But FP&A is becoming a big area where clients are starting to use AI to really start to look at how do they accelerate what we've historically done in Excel spreadsheets to drive those types of analytics and data. So that's where we're really seeing the distinction.

Mark Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Great. And then, Roger, you mentioned scaling up in consulting, and you mentioned incremental hiring there. Can you talk a little bit about the practices and the areas that you want to focus in within consulting?

Roger Carlile
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think it's the issues that are -- still remain in high demand in corporates, Corporate America, for example. So financial, financial transformation, financial technologies, technology generally, data analytics, risk, all those kinds of things, tax that get towards the ability to, in some cases, both for the clients to do more with less, for the clients to have a better view of their own organizations, all of those things and drive value.

So all of those things, I think, are still in high demand. Clients may be a little more cautious in taking the time to assess what they're doing, but those are still in high-demand services. And so we're looking to add our capabilities in those regards, those areas.

Mark Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Great. And then, Jenn, just a clarification. With regards to the SG&A, you mentioned $40 million to $42 million, and then you mentioned $6 million to $7 million in terms of stock comp and restructuring. Is the $40 million to $42 million inclusive or exclusive of that $6 million to $7 million in stock comp and restructuring?

Jennifer Ryu
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. The $40 million to $42 million is exclusive, so $6 million to $7 million of noncash and non-run rate restructuring costs on top of the $40 million to $42 million. And the reason why it's comparable essentially to our third quarter SG&A is because while we're realizing the benefits and the latest reduction in force we did in October, from a seasonality standpoint, we have the payroll tax reset. And also when we did the Ref in October, essentially, Q2 already kind of has almost a full quarter of benefit already in there. So -- but to answer your question, the $6 million to $7 million of non-run rate is in addition to, not part of the $40 million to $42 million.

Mark Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

And then how much of an impact was the higher healthcare costs? And are you doing anything in terms of plan design changes with regards to what you offer to your employees to ameliorate that?

Jennifer Ryu
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. The healthcare this quarter is about $1 million plus impact compared to Q2. So it is significant. It impacted both our SG&A and probably lesser impact on SG&A, but a lot of impact on gross margin. Yes, we do take an annual assessment of our plan design, and we also kind of look at the cost ratio sharing between employer and employees.

I would say that this quarter, this is an anomaly. We got a lot of unfavorable claims experience in October specifically. So I don't expect that this -- or at least I would think that this is an anomaly. So I think that this should normalize. Again, we don't have control over our claims experience, but we do take a pretty deep look each on an annual basis on our plan design.

Mark Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then, Roger, I didn't want to focus on the micro questions initially, but I'd love to come back to just kind of the broader strategic framework. It sounded like you're basically going to be looking at things over the next 12 months, I'm wondering if you can just talk a little bit about what you're going to really focus on and what your vision is, and it's probably going to end up changing as you learn more about the company. But what your vision is for what investors should expect 12 to 24 months from now?

Roger Carlile
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think I'm not sure the strategy itself changes at a high level. I mean we're going to be focused on our On-Demand services and our Consulting services. And those -- that's the 2 biggest things we do, and it's where we can drive a lot of value for our clients. So I think it's why we said the 3 focal points for our strategy in the near term, 12 months or longer if it takes is right, get the cost structure aligned with our revenue so that we're profitable on that basis.

For lack of a better word, fix our On-Demand. What I mean by that is what we've talked about, which is be sure we're getting our -- in front of our clients with our sales team and really understanding what the clients need and then working with our talent team to be sure that we are sourcing and have that kind of talent to offer them so that we can bring that kind of value to clients and do that in a focused and consistent manner.

And then thirdly, grow the Consulting segment that we can deliver those services. We can do that now, but we're not particularly scaled in those capabilities we talked about earlier. And so we want to add those, and I think we can grow. I think we have a real right to win in this space because of our ability to deliver in those 3 different modes that we spoke about earlier and to do so at a price point that creates, I think, a better overall value than some of the other competitors in the marketplace.

But all of that requires that we were focused in what we do and that we have the right talent in place to do it. And so there's some work in that. And that's really -- for me, that's the main thing, those items we just spoke about are the main thing we're focused on over the next 12 months. I can't tell you when I think exactly we'll see the results of that. I'd like to think you will start seeing -- it won't be 3/4 of nothing and then all in 1 quarter. So I'd like to think you'll start to see some incremental improvement as quarters go on, but I don't think that's going to be the next quarter. I think there's a lot of work that we have to do.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.

Roger, I know you started talking about AI. And I'm wondering, is that causing any of your clients to maybe take a step back as they try to figure out how they want to implement AI, what roles they might want? Is that causing any delays from a decision standpoint?

Roger Carlile
President, CEO & Director

Yes, I don't know if that itself is causing any decision delay. I think there are things that happen in the market where there's some level of uncertainty that would contribute to decision delays by clients. I think in the case of AI and automation, clients -- first of all, I think, by and large, like you read in a number of places, resources, I think there's more interest and effort to implement it, there is more impact and value yet for many clients. So I think it's fits and starts, right?

Like if you start the investment, you might have told whoever was authorized that investment that we're not going to need quite so much human capital to do this process, so you don't hire as much. And then later, you find out you do need it. So there can be some sort of starts and stops, but I think it's really more about what roles will AI sort of successfully make less necessary. And then as Bhadresh said earlier, what roles will AI enhance the capability of and actually make those roles more necessary or more efficient or successful in what they do. So there is some learning, I think, is going on with clients, but I don't know that that's particularly contributing to decision delay. I know, Bhadresh, you have a view on that?

Bhadresh Patel
Chief Operating Officer

Yes. The only thing I would add, Roger, is that what clients are getting bombarded with is spot technologies for a particular process or a spot process that AI can automate. And it's conflicting potentially with their enterprise applications. And those vendors are also SaaS-based products, which are saying they have AI in their products. And so no one's really matured full AI into all of their products, right?

So the clients are wrestling with, does my ERP system have AI now and can I leverage it? Or do I need a spot technology to fill a gap and then integrate that with my ERP technology to do that. So we're seeing that type of confusion right now, right? We're finding some clients that are very forward thinking, willing to experiment and go aggressive and understand that they may have to undo some things, and we always have laggard clients that are asking a lot of questions and want to kind of dip their toes in, but hesitant to do it.

So we're seeing all sorts of spectrums around this. I don't think we're seeing delayed decisions, right, in purchasing. But what clients are inquiring more about is what can we do with AI with what we have and what can we do with AI what we don't have. And that's the bigger debate with clients than it is a slowdown in decision-making.

And Jenn, just on the gross margins, I know you talked about the healthcare costs, obviously impacting both gross margin and SG&A, and then there's the extra holiday. If you try to take those out kind of normalized gross margins, where do you think gross margins would have been for this quarter -- for the quarter reported, I apologize.

Jennifer Ryu
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. This quarter in Q2, the impact of healthcare is almost 100 basis points. So without the additional sort of -- the abnormal healthcare costs, we probably would have reached 38% and then Q3, typically, that's our seasonality, right, because we have a lot of holidays in there. So how we -- so there's definitely seasonality, healthcare, a lot of noise.

But if you look at our pay bill ratio, it has steadily improved over the last -- probably last 4 -- 3, 4 probably plus quarters. And of course, Kartik, I mean, the impact of all of these indirect costs on gross margin also has to do with our revenue levels, too, and that leverage. So I think the main thing that we really focus on is things that we can control, which is the average bill rate and continue to improve that and also then on the consulting side to improve our utilization, which I think we've made pretty good progress in the last couple of quarters.
