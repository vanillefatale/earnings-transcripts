[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Christine Cho with Goldman Sachs.

Hyun Jin Cho
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the strong quarter, and I appreciate all the color. I'd like to better understand your supply chain initiatives as a key driver of the margin expansion going forward. So first, how do you size the opportunity in the midterm?

And two, how do you really plan to track and respond to consumer feedback regarding some of these product modifications that may arise due to your supplier changes, and to ensure kind of consistent quality across regions and stores?

Robert Lynch
CEO & Director

Katie, maybe I'll answer the second question first and then you come back to the expectations. Christine, so there will not be any spec or product modifications. We are committed to delivering the same quality that we have delivered. And it has made Shake Shack's reputation for culinary excellence what it is. So when we're looking at bringing on new suppliers, we go through a very thorough testing and validation process to make sure they can deliver the specs that meet our standards and that the quality is consistent or better than what we have used in the past. And that's across every component of the supply chain, whether it's the beef that we're using, the buns that we're using, our custard that goes to our shakes, our fries, everything has to meet our standards or else we will not add that supply to our system.

Katherine Fogertey
Chief Financial Officer

Christine. So how we would think about the savings potential here? We started to roll out some more material cost savings in the fourth quarter. We're expecting that to build into next year. We've talked about -- as you saw in the third quarter, we had a pretty big step up in our food and paper costs as a percentage of sales. That was largely led by the mid-teens inflation in the beef market. And what we're seeing now with being able to mitigate some of that cost pressure through negotiations with our current suppliers and some additional supply chain strategies is that next quarter we're anticipating that food and paper as a percentage of our sales will moderate to more normalized levels with this low single-digit inflation.

This is really powerful for us, and we expect that these benefits will grow into next year, especially considering historically, when we've had big swings in the beef market, our main lever has been to pull price to help offset that and protect margins. Now we just have a much bigger aperture of tools that we can use to help navigate these waters. And part of it is for -- to help optimize our cost structure. But also, as Rob talked about, we need to add more suppliers. We need to have multiple sources of supply on our critical items. And we need to make sure that we're really pushing ourselves to make sure that we have the right suppliers.

And so I believe all of that work is underway here. It's really exciting to see that also translate into an ability to help navigate what is likely to be a challenging market for the foreseeable future on beef and still have net overall pretty muted inflation in our business.

Hyun Jin Cho
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

And I think we've heard about kind of that broad deceleration in the macro intra-quarter and also softening trends into October. Could you kind of provide us with some thoughts on how you think about that setup in the fourth quarter? I know you pointed to D.C., New York travel pressures. But have you seen any pressures on the spending of the younger consumers under age 35 et cetera, that you would call out?

Robert Lynch
CEO & Director

Yes. I mean I would just say that I think it's pretty broadly understood that there's definitely some pressure on the lower income consumers. And I think there's also been some commentary about the unemployment rates of younger populations as well, which obviously impacts our industry. But we have taken those challenges and incorporated them into our strategy.

I called out in the commentary that we launched French Onion LTO at the beginning of October. And we weren't delivering the incremental growth that we had anticipated in what we were seeing in Q3. And so we did a lot of analytics to understand what was happening and what the challenges were. And everyone knows, and it's everyone's talking about it, there's obviously a push to value in this industry. And so we leverage something that worked really well for us in Q3. Over the last week, 1.5 weeks, we went back to our in-app value platform and shifted our media, and shifted our awareness building to that platform. And we have seen dramatic change in the trajectory of our business over that time. We've seen over 80% growth in our app traffic -- traffic sales.

So it's been really transformational for us. And that's a big part of our plan moving forward. We need to have a balanced approach. We are the premium player in the burger market and we will continue to offer a great culinary innovation that plays in that premium space, but we need to have a balanced approach where we also have a value offering that can be very attractive to our guests, but also be accretive to us both on top and bottom line. And by leveraging our -- which represents a relatively small portion of our business, the traffic that we're driving and the check that we have to give up to drive that traffic is much less cannibalistic of our holistic business. So it's really driving the performance that we're seeing right now in Q4 and what we anticipate will help us deliver strong results again in Q4.

Our next question is from Michael Tamas with Oppenheimer & Company.

Michael Tamas
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Actually, Rob, I wanted to follow up on that last point a little bit. You talked about how French Onion Burger didn't perform up to what you thought it was going to. So maybe what surprised you relative to what you thought was going to happen? And how does that change the way that maybe you're testing, or that innovation calendar? Because the message has been pretty clear that you're excited about the innovation calendar going forward. And so is there anything about what you're doing that might need to change to drive that innovation going forward?

Robert Lynch
CEO & Director

Yes. Great question. What I would say is that French Onion was another flavored burger. And it's not that there's not room for flavored burgers in our innovation calendar. But it's -- that is kind of our standard based form of innovation. Moving forward, including another big idea that we have coming this quarter, it's much more of innovation that we haven't done before. Ideas that bring a new story, not just a new flavor to the ticket. And so we're focused on trying to bring things we've never done before, complemented by some of our historic LTOs that have been our biggest winners.

So Truffle was a huge success for us. You're going to see Truffle again. For the Korean menu, a huge success for us, you're going to see that again. And we'll continue to innovate on our burgers. But right now, we're really focused on -- if we're going to be advertising and marketing a premium price point, it needs to be something that can generate, earn media, be newsworthy outside of just the launch a couple of days, a couple of articles written about it. We want our guests talking about our premium innovation similar to Dubai Shake, things that really create virality around the ideas that we're bringing. So that's the premium part.

The other innovation that we're delivering, I just mentioned, is on the -- in our digital platforms, particularly in our app. Like we have never seen the kind of growth that we're seeing right now in our app. We both in the form of downloads as well as actual sales. And it's driving traffic growth on our business. And so that is going to be a focal point for us. We're going to continue to double down there. We just launched our new platform, which is our 1, 3, 5 platform $1 drinks, $3 fries and $5 shakes. And I think that this is a transformational thing for Shake Shack.

It shows -- and we really built this and we talked about it, is how we show empathy to our guests during some challenging times. And I think that's resonated and that's going to -- that balance is going to be the holistic innovative way we approach the marketplace. It's not just about the premium offerings. It's about having a balanced approach, particularly in this time where we need to make sure that we're delivering value to our guests.

Michael Tamas
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

And it's sort of like you knew my next question was going to be about value. Do you think that the 1, 3, 5 on the drinks, the fries and the shakes, do you think that's powerful enough for the consumer to recognize the value while you're still running premium burgers and sandwiches? Or do you think you need to sort of pivot a little bit on more of those like center-of-the-plate entree items to really give the consumer a little bit more value?

Robert Lynch
CEO & Director

Well, I can tell you, I have 10 days of data that would suggest it's extremely impactful. So I'm really excited about what we think this can do for us through the balance of the quarter and heading into 2026. And I can't wait to share those results with you next year when we're reporting on Q4.

Our next question is from Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James.

Brian Vaccaro
CGS International

I wanted to ask about operations and sort of the guest experience and really appreciate the color you provided on average ticket times now below 6 minutes. I was wondering if you could elaborate just on what you're seeing in terms of other guest satisfaction metrics? Obviously, speed is very important, but it does sound like you're seeing improvements in the experience, quality, maybe taste metrics, that sort of thing. Are there any other metrics worth highlighting?

Robert Lynch
CEO & Director

Brian, I had a call with Stephanie last night at like 9:00 after she wrapped up. She's in Atlanta with our entire senior operations leadership team. We built this Atlanta center to bring our teams from all over the United States and be able to collaborate and plan and train and develop our teams. And it's amazing everybody is using this space right out of the gate, our operators, our development teams.

But she had our operations team there over the last couple of days, and they are doing their quarterly business planning. And they are building plans to close the year really strong and they're also building plans to make sure that we have a pipeline of talent to be able to open up 60 Shacks next year. So our operations have really never been at this level. And every time I think we can't get better, we get better.

And it's as much about the mindset and the culture as it is about the specific components of the plan. We -- our team, our operators right now are not talking about the macros. They're not talking about the challenges. They're talking about how we can serve our guests better. They're talking about how we can get faster. They're talking about how we can get better at deploying our labor where it needs to be. They're talking about how now we can extend hours to better service our guests in the Shacks where it makes sense. So -- and they're doing that with excitement and pride. And winning begets winning. And these guys have knocked it out of the park for the last year and have gotten better every month.

And we've had some turnover and brought in some external leaders that have really brought great perspective to kind of the middle to higher end of our operations team. But it's also the folks who have been here for a long time and have been a part of Shake Shack for a long time. Sometimes when you bring in change and you try to transform something in 12 months there's resistance. And my discussion with Stephanie last night is like, look, everybody is on board. Everybody is full go. They're not talking about how tough it is. They're talking about how great we're doing. And that gives me the confidence that we're going to be able to continue to improve on our speed, accuracy, particularly in the delivery channels is a big core focus for us. We want to make sure that we're getting those orders right because those guests aren't in our dining rooms. They're not able to bring up something if it's not right. So we're focused on accuracy. We're focused on speed.

And something that Katie talked about, and I talked a little bit about in the comments, we are significantly increasing the tenure and retention of our team members. You would think as we hold our teams more accountable, that, that might create an environment where people don't want to be a part of it. It's just the opposite. They're seeing success. They're seeing opportunities for them to advance their careers and they're staying longer. And that tenure builds experience, which makes them more productive and makes us a better operating units. So all of those things are moving in the right direction.

On the guest sat -- yes, I mean get satisfaction across restaurant cleanliness, friendliness, all of the things that you measure have all moved in the right direction despite less labor hours. So we're just getting better. We're not ripping out labor to just drive savings. We're building models that optimize our labor pool, and that's delivering better guest satisfaction.

Brian Vaccaro
CGS International

All right. That's very helpful. And just a follow-up, if I could. Just Katie, a question on the G&A guidance. I think if we did our math right, it implies maybe a $10 million increase in the quarterly spend versus what we saw in Q3. And I understand you've added a lot of new talent to the organization. But could you just elaborate on what's driving the uptick in the fourth quarter?

Katherine Fogertey
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Yes. So as Rob talked about, we are making some meaningful investments here in marketing and media to drive the business. We're really excited about the stuff that we have lined up. We started kind of marketing this 1, 3, 5 platform that you talked about on the value side and seeing extremely strong results on the back of it. And we also have some exciting steps planned for later this year. These investments that we're making are all really geared at driving traffic, driving sales which, in turn, we expect to drive profitability at the restaurant level and beyond. So we're really excited about that.

For those who haven't followed us as closely last quarter, we did talk about kind of embarking on this new strategy, new for us, kind of common place for the industry. But new for us of investing into paid media to better expand and grow the awareness and our message, and our ability to drive traffic at our restaurants. The results that we showed in the third quarter with 130 basis points of positive traffic growth and some really strong comps, especially relative to a challenged industry give us the confidence that this is indeed the model that we should be doing, and we're excited to make these investments here today.

Our next question is from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.

Sharon Zackfia
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

I wanted to delve in a little bit more on that improvement you've seen in speed. And 5 minutes and 50 seconds is obviously a big improvement, but I'm curious what that bell curve looks like when you look across the Shacks, and what you would view like an ideal speed over time for the company to get to?

Robert Lynch
CEO & Director

That's a great question. And I think when you think about speed of service, averages can be very -- even though that's what we shared. Averages can be a little bit vague. I mean, what we are focused on right now is mitigating the tickets over 7 minutes. We want to make sure that we are not executing in a way that frustrates our guests. People don't get real upset about 5 minutes and 30 seconds versus 5 minutes and 50 seconds. They get upset when it's 8 minutes to get their food. So our plan to continue to drive down the average ticket time is to minimize our exceedingly long tickets. And that usually happens in rush when we've got super busy Shacks. Obviously, we do high-volume hours. And so some of the ways we're going to mitigate that is through some of the equipment technology that we talked about.

One of the things that holds us up is we're making fries to order. And that takes a lot of time. And it's not like we can't hold fries. It's what everybody does. It will make them hotter, and it will give us better access to those fries. And so like fry holding is a simple way for us to make sure that, that doesn't become a bottleneck while still delivering the same or better quality. So there's equipment solutions that we can impart. There's also labor deployment.

We used to -- part of what we're doing and how we're driving labor savings is we used to have like standard deployment schedules where when we opened, we always had in every Shack 5 or 6 people show up. We don't need 5 or 6 people every minute of opening. We're staggering the approach. We're bringing people in when we need them. What that does is it frees up some labor for us to deploy during the peak hours. So as we move underutilized labor off the shoulders and into the peaks, we're going to be able to get faster and be better.

So there's equipment solutions, there's labor deployment optimization that are all going to drive improvement. But I think if we're in that 5-minute zone, 5 to 6 minutes like we're making our customers happy. They know it takes longer. We're cooking to order but we can't have the 8 minutes to 10 minute orders. That's where -- that's the danger zone.

Sharon Zackfia
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

I also wanted to ask a follow-up on the menu innovation. Clearly, I think a lot of it has been on the premium end, and it sounds like French dip and ribs might be there as well. Is the idea that you can keep kind of your base price at a very affordable kind of hurdle for the consumer and allow them to self-select into these kind of higher price points and drive check that way? I'm just curious how you're thinking about kind of balancing premium versus value?

Robert Lynch
CEO & Director

I mean, you absolutely nailed it. We have pricing power. I want to make it really clear that if there is some significant inflation, we could execute price increases to mitigate that inflation. We are approaching pricing in a very disciplined way and challenging ourselves to not take pricing, especially in this environment. So we will continue to utilize pricing in the most productive way. But we want to hold -- we want to keep our core menu prices as low as we can possibly keep them. And the way to do that, is to get more efficient in our supply chain, more efficient in our operations, and to bring this innovation that allows us to have people, like you said, self-select into more premium price points and drive check growth.

But I will tell you, we're also being very judicious on how we price those premium innovations. We have a big innovations coming here in the next couple of weeks that we're really excited about. And we are being very aggressive on the price point for what we're offering. And we're doing that because right now in this environment is the time to take share. Right now, when there's a challenging environment, that's the time when great companies get better. And we are focused on taking share. We are focused on making investments. We're not -- excuses and results are negatively correlated. Like we are not blaming macros. They are out there. We'll acknowledge them. It'd be naive not to do so. But we're building plans to address them. And we are focused on delivering value at every price point, whether it's our premium innovation, our core menu or the value offerings that we're putting into our app.

Our next question is from Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities.

Jake Bartlett
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

My first is on COGS and the impact of, obviously, beef inflation. You expect it to go into -- continue into '26. My question is that you've had some nice offsets this year, even aside from the supply chain savings, but you've seen some lower costs on the other items. So I guess if you can kind of give us a base case or roughly what we should and what you're thinking about for overall inflation -- food cost inflation in '26, including the items outside of beef, that would be helpful? And I have a follow-up.

Katherine Fogertey
Chief Financial Officer

Jake. So how we're thinking about next year, we have this long-term guidance that we're going to be able to continue to expand our restaurant margins that's consistent with our 3-year outlook. We've reiterated that today, calling for 50 basis points a year in restaurant margin expansion. How we get there, and as we've talked about, we're expecting a lot of that next year to come from supply chain and through kind of the natural leverage from growing the business.

We are embarking on kind of an accelerating path of supply chain savings. And also, as you've called out, there are some items that are moving more favorable as well in the commodity basket. We are planning for beef prices to still be a pressure though, next year. And we are working with our suppliers to help navigate through that environment, still meeting our objectives and our guidance for continued margin expansion next year without having to lean on a significant amount of price to offset the beef markets.

I will share all of the details on how 2026 will -- how we're expecting that to shape up when we give our annual guidance in January.

Jake Bartlett
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Great. And then I had another question about the labor savings that you've been realizing. You're going to be lapping some right about now the labor deployment and then in January that the new scorecard. So the question is how much more you have kind of in the tank for labor efficiency? I know the message is you're kind of switching much more to the supply chain to drive the margin expansion. But is there any opportunity still to drive efficiencies with labor into '26 and beyond?

Robert Lynch
CEO & Director

So one of the big opportunity, untapped opportunities is on equipment. So we have built essentially an equipment innovation center in Atlanta. And our teams are doing work that we've never done before at Shake Shack to bring a standardized kitchen model that leverages equipment, that is really all about making our teams more efficient through increasing the ease to execute our model and delivering higher-quality hotter items faster.

And we just had our global team come into Atlanta last week, and we shared some of these ideas with them, and they were blown away. And their remark was all the kitchen innovation used to come from our licensees internationally because they were going out and doing things that Shake Shack wasn't necessarily exploring. And now we are bringing the ideas to our restaurants, but also bringing them to our license partners so that they can operate their kitchens more efficiently, drive higher margins and build more Shacks at a more rapid rate globally. So equipment is a big untapped opportunity for us to be able to continue to drive operational efficiency and increase our speed.

Our next question is from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.

Jeffrey Bernstein
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Just wanted to build on the marketing discussion. I know you mentioned building a foundation of a brand marketing model. I'm just wondering what new do you think we'll see into '26? I mean it sounds like a ramping on the paid media, which just began and wondering how that will tie in with the new loyalty program being rolled out in '26? How you think the interplay on those will drive incremental traffic? And then I had one follow-up.

Robert Lynch
CEO & Director

Yes. I mean our product innovation supported -- our product innovation and our value platforms, supported by media are what we are focused on delivering new guests, creating awareness and traffic, right? Our loyalty platform should increase frequency. And right now, what we are doing with 1, 3, 5 and the amount of adoption and downloads. And the -- all of that increased application user base is going to transfer directly into our loyalty platform. So we will launch our loyalty with a built-in user base and we will be able to leverage that loyalty platform to drive frequency with our most valuable guests.

So both of those work in a symbiotic way together. We're going to advertise and bring people in with exciting new innovation and value platforms. They come in into our -- over the next 6 to 9 months as we build out our loyalty platform. They transition into the loyalty platform, and we leverage that to drive frequency. And that's the model that we're going to employ next year and moving forward.

Jeffrey Bernstein
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Understood. It does seem like there's confidence around the comp trajectory and initiatives there. And obviously, the unit growth that is accelerating in terms of openings and the restaurant margin, Katie, you just mentioned, kind of margin expansion. I guess it's the G&A that's therefore getting a lot of the attention and hopefully, that gets a good return. But because of the significant uptick in the full year spend this year, I know you said paid media starting in the fourth quarter. Should we therefore assume that, that uptick is sustained in 2026, presumably more like the fourth quarter of '25? Is it a good run rate to assume for that? How should we think about the -- at least directionally, that G&A spend, which seems to be the only area that's maybe working counter to all the other things that have that positive trajectory?

Robert Lynch
CEO & Director

Yes. No, it's a great question. I mean, we will obviously be providing guidance on 2026 in January. So I'm not going to necessarily speak to what we're forecasting in sales. But what I can tell you is the G&A is the fuel that's going to drive the comps. And obviously, we are going to make investments that we believe we're going to get returns from.

And so this, as I said earlier, this environment, where we're seeing a lot of competitors be challenged and lose traffic. This is our opportunity. This is our opportunity to take share. This is our opportunity to gain customers at a disproportionate rate. So we are all in. We are -- we believe ourselves to be a hyper growth company, right? And now we have the operations excellence to have 100% confidence that when we're sending new guests, or infrequent guests who may have had a bad experience in the past, back to our Shacks, they are going to have a balanced options in terms of value and premium. They're going to have the highest quality that we've ever delivered, and it's all going to be served fast and accurately. So that creates lifetime value.

So yes, I mean, we're investing G&A because that's the fuel. And over time, we should be able to scale that investment. We should be able to grow our revenue faster than we grow the rate at which we invest marketing and G&A, and that's going to create margin expansion. So this is a first in time we've invested at scale on paid media. And so yes, right now, it isn't scaled. It isn't necessarily at the point where we're able to decrease our G&A as a function of revenue, but that's the plan. And so it's either that or we kind of batten down the hatches. And we're not prepared to like issue a dividend anytime soon. This is a growth company. We're going to invest in growth. We believe that we have the right model in place.

Our next question is from Andy Barish with Jefferies.

Andrew Barish
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Rob, just a question kind of from your background in QSR and sort of taking a higher-level approach to what's been sort of an unrelenting discounting promotional environment, both below you guys as well as above. How do you kind of see that playing out in '26? And is that informing any of your decisions on driving the Shake Shack business? Or do you guys think you can do what you can do if you execute on the plans you've given us today?

Robert Lynch
CEO & Director

Yes. I mean we're in the thick of it right now. I mean, everybody is pushing value. You've got $5 meals. You've got $11 casual dining meals where you sit down and get waited on, like there's value of plenty. And we are executing our model in the thick of that and delivering, I think, outpaced results.

We're not optimized yet. We are going to continue to learn. We're going to continue to get better. Some of our things we're doing have better results than other things we're doing. But we are very well prepared to deliver a balanced growth engine into 2026. And we -- like I said, are continuing to identify what works, what doesn't, what price points make sense, how to execute things, which target audiences to go after? All of that is feeding our plan moving forward.

And I'll just tell you, it never feels good to get on a call and say, hey, we ran something for 3 weeks, and it didn't work, but -- as well as we wanted it to. But what I want everyone to take away from that is that we have an agile business model. We are going to evaluate everything in real time with data and analytics. And when we see an opportunity to improve our results, we can shift into something that we believe will give us higher returns and deliver better outcomes.

So we have our plan already in place for 2026. We know what we're launching. We know when we're launching it, we know how we're doing it. We'll continue to assess the environment, the competitive environment as well as the results that we see and optimize on an ongoing basis.
