[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen.

Gautam Khanna
TD Cowen, Research Division

I was wondering, Tony, if you could elaborate on how broad-based you're starting to see the airframe customers participate in ordering? And is this kind of Boeing-specific stuff where you were previously experienced a bit of a destock post the strike over at Boeing?

Tony Thene
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes, I think 2 really important points that I made in the prepared remarks. I will say at a high level, across all of our aerospace submarkets, whether that be engine, fastener, structural, we're seeing increased activity with increasing forward demand. Specifically, though, in this quarter, the 2 things that stood out the most are that you had engine orders continue to increase sequentially, 30% this quarter. That's significant. Maybe you could argue even more significant is what our structural customers did in the quarter.

And you rightly said, Gautam, the impact of Boeing really put them on the sidelines. Prior to those issues, they had been probably the top submarket in terms of ordering quantity. So they had a lot of inventory to see them now come off the sidelines and 2 things, not only one place some significant orders, but then immediately come back to us and say, there's more coming and they're going to be bigger and more urgent. That's a big positive sign. And I would agree with you that at least on the structural side that, that was primarily driven by the confidence in Boeing, not just in what they believe they can do, but what they've actually achieved in this last month.

Gautam Khanna
TD Cowen, Research Division

Okay. That's very helpful. And you mentioned the defense submarket saw a bit of a government shutdown impact. Do you have any visibility from customers in that submarket as to how they expect to kind of put in orders over the next couple of quarters?

Tony Thene
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. We've already seen that come back. I mean, quite frankly, they would have liked to have been placing orders during that time, but weren't able to do so or weren't allowed to do so because of the government shutdown. So you've got some pent-up order demand there. So we see that coming back very rapidly.

Gautam Khanna
TD Cowen, Research Division

Okay. And last one for me, just on -- you mentioned the mix in the quarter itself. So the basic message, I think, is that overall pricing saw no reduction. This is purely a mix dynamic. Pricing is still trending, as you've said for the last couple of years, higher for longer. Is that right?

Tony Thene
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Well, it's 100% right. And maybe if you allow me to speak more about this. This is something that we've talked about a lot. In fact, we signaled this on the last call where we said based on some of the planned maintenance that we're going to do, specifically in some of the testing equipment at the back end that a lot of the higher-priced aerospace needs to go through that, that would impact that, all right? So I've talked about that quite a bit. And I think that if there's some belief that a small sequential price decline, which we've said could happen multiple times, it's somehow a red flag. I don't think you could be any more wrong than that.

I mean, we just talked about it, Gautam, aerospace-only bookings up 23%. Aerospace engine bookings up 30%, just completed 3 aerospace engine LTAs at substantial price increases. I can tell you very clearly, we are not -- or we did not discount premium aerospace products in the quarter. There is absolutely no reason to do so. And I've repeated this many, many times, and we said it probably several times over the last year that we see pricing actions continue to be a positive tailwind for us going forward. And I would just say, quite frankly, this should be obvious due to the supply-demand imbalance that exists today, and that's only expected to intensify. So there is no issue with what happened in this quarter in terms of a slight price per pound decrease, and you'll see that continuing to go up over the next several quarters. Hopefully, that's helpful.

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank.

Scott Deuschle
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Tony, I'm going to take a shot at a question. I'm not sure if you'll be able to answer. But for the aerospace LTAs that have renewed over the last 6 months, can you say whether the average price increase is more or less than 30%?

Tony Thene
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Scott, I think you already know the answer to that. I mean, these are substantial price increases going forward. 30% is not substantial.

Scott Deuschle
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And these are post-COVID LTAs?

Tony Thene
CEO & Chairman of the Board

There are -- there have been 1 or 2 that are longer that were signed prior to COVID. But primarily, these are ones that are -- that have come due again since that time, yes.

Scott Deuschle
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And 30% is not substantial for those?

Tony Thene
CEO & Chairman of the Board

I agree with you.

Scott Deuschle
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. Tony, just to deliver this strong SAO guide for the third quarter, should we expect volume, price per pound and EBIT per pound to all move up sequentially?

Tony Thene
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. Scott, I would say yes to that. I don't manage at that level of detail. Like I know I am sitting on a gold mine here, right, doing something that very few people in the world can do. So I'm going to supply all of those customers to the best of our ability to maximize the profitability. If one quarter, my margin goes down 0.5 percentage point, Scott, that's not an issue, right? The overall trajectory is going forward. And I think we get very hung up with this fact of quarter-over-quarter, you have some of these small movements basically because you've got a complex production system that's making 1,000 different types of alloys in any one quarter, right?

So I wouldn't get so hung up on slight movements to that quarter-over-quarter. I will say year-over-year, absolutely, you will see increases in price per pound and earnings per pound. There is no doubt. It's impossible for us not to deliver that based on the overall market dynamics going forward. Does that make sense?

Scott Deuschle
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Absolutely. And just last question, the medical distribution channel, is there any real sizable revenue left in that channel that you're shipping this past quarter? Or I'm just trying to think, is there still downward pressure potential there? Or is it basically completely bottomed out and near 0?

Tony Thene
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Well, I can tell you that the good news in January from a booking standpoint that we saw that specific area come back and have the highest order intake than it had of any month in 2025. So that would suggest that I agree that, yes, you're right that it's probably hit the bottom. And I think the big piece here is that's very impactful to the PEP segment. As you well know, Scott, you cover us very closely. It's not material to overall Carpenter, and it doesn't impact what I say about my guidance whatsoever. I want to see that bounce up. And I think when it does here in the next couple of quarters, it will be a tailwind for us. But it's not something I rely on to hit my guidance numbers.

Next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan with Jones Trading.

Joshua Sullivan
JonesTrading Institutional Services, LLC, Research Division

Tony, you made an interesting comment there. You said jet engine OEMs are asking you if their own supply chains have ordered enough materials to meet projected build rates. But you kind of left us on a cliff hanger there. What was your answer? And I guess, how are those conversations translating to the expectations of their suppliers?

Tony Thene
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Well, I mean, the answer is going to be different depending on the customer. I would say that in many cases, our answer to that is no, they're not ordering quick enough. There needs to be more orders in the system based on the demand that -- or the build rate that you want to achieve. So I would say -- and that's a positive thing for me to say is that there needs to be more orders to hit this build rate projection that's out there. We just talked about specifically on the structural side, their hesitation to place orders and wanting to see more and more evidence of prolonged performance from the airframers, specifically Boeing. You're starting to see that. So you see them now coming off the sidelines. I've said that phrase several times now and placing large orders.

So I've talked about this, Scott, more than once about there is not going to be a gradual increase in orders. You're seeing it now, and then you're going to see a significant hockey stick. That's the way it's happened in the past. I believe that's the way it will happen again this time. And I think the structural customers with the activity they had in this last quarter is one of the leading indicators to that.

Joshua Sullivan
JonesTrading Institutional Services, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And actually, that dovetails nicely into just the conversation on the long-term agreements you highlighted. What's your calculus or your mindset on committing to those versus leaving spot capacity open as you've talked about in the past, you've got the golden goose. Just curious on your thoughts there.

Tony Thene
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Well, I don't -- I mean, that's another -- you know this. I mean, the words matter to me. I don't have spot pricing, right? I don't have a generic alloy sitting on the shelf waiting for the highest bidder to come get, right? My LTAs are based on a mutual beneficial relationship with my customers. You have a lot of volume, I'm going to give you surety of supply. So I'm not here trying to be the riverboat gambler trying to say, let's keep it all speculative. That's not what I'm trying to do. But I do understand the value of my product as do my customers. So when there's that beneficial relationship to say, let's enter into an LTA with increasing prices, that's good for both of us. So I think, Josh, you know this. I'm not sitting on the sidelines waiting for somebody to bid on my products. And I'm pretty sure that's not what you were trying to allude to anyway.

Joshua Sullivan
JonesTrading Institutional Services, LLC, Research Division

No, I was just curious on the long term. And I guess just relatedly, just outside of aerospace, are you seeing more interest in those types of relationships as you talk about IGT and some of those other markets? Are you seeing similar levels of interest, [ so the ] capacity might not be there?

Tony Thene
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Absolutely, primarily on the power generation side because, as you well know, in many cases, they use the same assets. But we also see some of that on the medical side as well, primarily on the SAO business because there's times that there can be overlap on some of the production assets between some of those alloys. So you see more interest in those specific alloys for medical customers because in many cases, we're the sole supplier and have a proprietary alloy there. So in both nondistribution medical and especially in power generation, we see some of the same dynamics as far as the openness or the willingness or wanting to have an LTA with us in those areas.

Next question comes from the line of Bennett Moore with JPMorgan.

Bennett Moore
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats on yet another impressive quarter. Quick, I wanted to -- thank you for all the color and commentary on the bookings, but could you also comment on how engine and fastener sales trended during the quarter and year-over-year? And also what lead times look like for structural products relative to engine alloys?

Tony Thene
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes, it's a good question. Our overall aerospace, you saw our sales were relatively flat quarter-over-quarter basically because of the number of operating days you've written about this as well as the holidays. So aerospace engine sales were relatively flat, down a couple of percent. Engine fasteners was flat, I think, up 1%. So all of the submarkets inside of aerospace were plus or minus 1% or 2% on a sequential basis. Certainly on a year-over-year basis, all of them up quite substantially, as you would expect.

The second part of your question was on lead times. You're also very well aware that lead times isn't a universal indicator of demand increasing just because we limit -- we cap lead times. But I can say that in that area, you have seen them extend across all the areas inside of aerospace. And I think we'll be pushing right back up to that same level that we were before in very short order. But yes, we did see some -- we did see expansion of lead times.

Bennett Moore
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And I guess in the context of your positive commentary around structural customers moving off the sidelines, is it just fair to assume that lead times generally for the structural alloys are shorter than the engine alloys, so we could see that benefit sooner?

Tony Thene
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. I think in general, that is a true statement.

Bennett Moore
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. And then real quick, I just wanted to ask about the additive business, and you showed strong growth during the quarter. Is this lumpy? Or are you seeing improved adoption in the space? And can you remind us how the margin profile compares for these products? And if this is a space Carpenter would look to grow into the future?

Tony Thene
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. I think the second part of your question is the right way to look at it. We see it as something that could be a tailwind for us in the future. We've been inside the additive business for quite some time. This is a higher adoption rate and some increased activity with some very large customers that we bring proprietary alloy in that area. So it's still relatively small in the whole scheme of things, Bennett. But yes, I think it's something we want to stay in. And I think going forward, we'll see continued growth in that area. So I'm very happy, quite frankly, with the performance of additive. Again, relatively small from an earnings standpoint, but very happy with the way they've been performing over the last couple of quarters.

Next question comes from the line of Andre Madrid with BTIG.

Andre Madrid
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

As we look at the LTAs signed in the quarter, I mean, are any of these first-time customers on an LTA basis? And I mean, how should we expect the mix of LTAs to trend in the quarters and years to come?

Tony Thene
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Well, it's going to be -- there's not a trend. They're all at different times. It seems like we're always working on some type of LTA. And to answer the first part of your question, these are longer-term customers, so not new.

Andre Madrid
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Got it. And then we've been hearing a lot of chatter from recent conversations with customers about potentially exploring capacity expansion that they help fund. I mean, is that something that you guys would ever look into?

Tony Thene
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Maybe if something became more than just chatter that I could comment on that. So we have already made our position known. We have gone out there and announced capacity expansion in a very professional manner. We told you exactly what the pounds will be. We've told you exactly when it will come online. We've told you exactly what the equipment will be, and we've told you exactly what the impact will be not only to Carpenter Technology's financials, but the overall supply-demand dynamic. So we've been very, very clear and professional on what that would be. So we've told you already how we would react, and we were able and willing to fund that 100% ourselves.

Andre Madrid
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Got it. That's clear. And then if I could sneak one more in. I mean, can you just maybe break down a little more clearly where the orders are exactly coming from? I mean, jet engine versus airframe, OEM versus MRO? Like is there a split that you can provide?

Tony Thene
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Well, I mean, we're -- orders are up across the board. I mean, I give you a couple of examples. Engines were up 30%. That's significant, right? So I mean, we have order intake increasing across all of the submarkets. The one I called out from a sales standpoint, you obviously saw a bit of a dip in defense from a sales standpoint, but now you see orders, I think, will start picking back up again. So we have order intake increase across all of the markets. And again, Andre, that shouldn't be a surprise. Look what you have out there. Look what Boeing and Airbus and MRO and what all that is doing, that's increasing significantly. Of course, orders are going to have to increase also.

Andre Madrid
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Yes. No, I agree completely and I see -- I appreciate the color, Tony. I will hop back and thanks.

And our last question comes from the line of Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Philip Gibbs
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Tim, can you give us a review of the CapEx this year again, just in terms of how much you expect to spend overall and how much of that is going to the new project and how much carries over into fiscal '27?

Timothy Lain
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Phil, I'll break that into pieces, and then you can follow up if you want to. The full year guidance for total CapEx was $300 million to $315 million. That includes the $175 million to $185 million for the brownfield capacity expansion. I also said that given where we are, we spent about a little over $80 million through the first half. We said that we expect brownfield capacity expansion spending to increase pretty rapidly in the second half as activity ramps up. There's a lot -- there's a fair amount of assumptions there. Look, at the big capital project complex. The timing of those capital expenditures may vary. I mean we're making assumptions about progress payments, when the equipment gets delivered, payment terms. So we'll provide an update in the next quarter. But I mean, the guidance out there still holds true for now. And that's incorporated into our free cash flow guidance.

Philip Gibbs
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

And Tony, any of the LTAs that you signed, have they been with power gen manufacturers at all?

Tony Thene
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Well, the 3 that I mentioned on the call here were all aerospace.

Philip Gibbs
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

But none of the prior 5, for example, that you mentioned last quarter?

Tony Thene
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Traditionally, that's not been an area that's been LTAs for us, but it's an area -- I think it was to Josh's question earlier, it's an area that we're now exploring that the customers in that submarket would like to enter into an LTA, and that could be something that we're interested in as well. But traditionally, that has not been for us because of the size has been relatively small to the rest of the business. It's becoming obviously much bigger now.

Philip Gibbs
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

And then lastly, I know it's a small business for you all relative to SAO and PEP. But what surprised you just relative to the outcome? Because I know you expected to do better. I know you had mentioned outright medical, but usually, you have pretty good visibility within a given quarter or so.

Tony Thene
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes, you're speaking specifically of that submarket inside of medical.

Philip Gibbs
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I'm just saying in general for the segment, I know you expected to do better a few months ago, and you usually have very good intra-quarter visibility. So I'm just saying kind of what surprised you?

Tony Thene
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes, in the PEP segment. Correct?

Philip Gibbs
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Yes.

Tony Thene
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. Yes. I mean, yes, listen, I think that's a fair question. I think we do usually have pretty good visibility. This one on medical distribution, quite frankly, has been a little elusive for us to get a handle around that, quite frankly. I think that's a fair comment. But a good point is that the order intake for that specific submarket was the highest in January had been in any month in 2025. So Phil, I'm hoping that on that -- for the PEP segment, that's hit the bottom. But as you can see with our guidance, we're still remaining fairly cautious in that area. And as you said, again, it doesn't impact our overall guidance, but it's important to us to do the best we can as far as forecasting what we think PEP can do as well. So a little bit of conservatism maybe or a little bit of let's wait and see to make sure we can get it.

That concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to John Huyette for closing remarks.
