The first question today comes from Mauricio Serna with UBS.


Mauricio Serna Vega
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Great. First, on the commentary about the momentum continuing into the fourth quarter. Could you elaborate a little bit more about what your trends are quarter-to-date? And if I just look at the guidance for the full year, I think the implied guide for Q4 is roughly minus 5% to up almost 4%. Could you maybe explain like a little bit more why you have like this wide range for the Q4 sales guidance?


Douglas Howe
CEO & Director

Good morning Mauricio, this is Doug. Thanks for your question. Yes, we are encouraged, obviously, as we said in our prepared remarks with regards to the sequential improvement we saw in Q3 and October was actually the strongest month of that period. And that momentum has continued into Q4. I don't want to get into a lot of specifics in the current quarter, but the key categories, the key brands, the classifications that we're giving momentum in Q3 have continued, namely the top 8 brands continue to outperform. The boot category in particular, as I mentioned, was off to a very strong start, specifically as it relates to regular price selling in Q3. That has definitely continued.

The teams have done an amazing job to be able to react to that trend as well. The affordable luxury business, while small and overall volume is almost double what it was last year. So we're seeing some really nice momentum there as well. And all of that is baked into the guidance that we provided for the full year. There's a little bit of noise if you think about the difference between the retail sales and brands. As I mentioned, brands had a bit of a decrease in Q3 based on some temporary timing shifts of delivery, but that will be rebounding and we're forecasting positive sales there. So that creates a little bit of noise in the Q4 results for total net retail sales.

Got it. And in terms of gross margin, nice to see the progress. How are you thinking about the gross margin in Q4? And maybe just any high-level commentary on what you're seeing in terms of the promotional environment?


Douglas Howe
CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks for the question. We continue to be encouraged by how the teams have managed gross margin, specifically at DSW. As I mentioned, in Q3, we had 140 basis point improvement in markdown rate. And we see similar favorability in Q4. We're anticipating that as well. The gross margin in Q4, there is a promo environment, but we're not seeing a lot of resistance from our customers as it relates to higher prices.

Our AUR was up nicely. Some of the categories that are strongest performing are the higher AUR categories as well. We, as I said, have been mindful of walking away from some unprofitable digital promotions, and we'll continue to do that. Seeing a little bit of pressure on digital top line, but significant expansion in operating income in that channel.
