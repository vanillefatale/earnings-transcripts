Brian Holland

Thanks. Good afternoon and congratulations on the strong quarter. I wanted to hit on, I guess, maybe first off, obviously, you highlighted the incremental wins at Target, Food Lion. That's fantastic. Anything you could share on the AIC front progress that you've made this quarter?

Adam L Michaels

Yeah. Thanks, Brian. And really, the credit goes to the team. Yeah, Chris is doing an incredible job. So I think I've shared with you before, Chris's goals for the year and his team is AIC-driven.

So you're seeing more and more items come at each customer. So for instance, Publix, we've traditionally had some meal products. We just got two new paninis in. New items we've had traditionally at BJ's. We've had proteins. We've now just got new, I guess, non-proteins. So we got these really great sweet potatoes and a tortellini salad. Two new wins at Fresh Market with actually these cool honey-thyme carrots and the sweet potatoes. So yes, it's absolutely the first thing. Actually, Chris and I, every time we have our one-on-one every week, it starts with our first goal, which is driving AIC. Our second goal, which is driving velocities, and we talk about what trade programs he's doing in partnership with Lauren, what marketing programs they're doing. So velocity is number two. And actually, a distant third is ACV.

And I've shared with everyone before, that's because I'm efficient, or maybe I'm just cheap. And it is just way the ROI is way higher on getting another item into a store that's already getting a truck delivered or investing in velocity where the product's already there. ACV is harder in the sense or sorry, it's not harder, but it takes longer at times if we don't have any relationship with that customer. You brought up just the great work that Chris and his team did with Target. Look, that took a while. That took probably a year. Food Lion, a little shorter, but we get a new item into Publix, we could do it in a week. A new item into a new customer that we haven't had in the past, it could take a year. So AIC is number one when we talk about things.

So hopefully, that adds some color.

Brian Holland

Yep. Yep. Appreciate that color. Maybe just pivoting to Costco, as this MVM goes into full swing, I believe, later this month. Obviously, important period kind of in front of that from a sell-through standpoint. I think you made some reference to maybe some things that you're actively doing to drive awareness and visibility. Just curious what you're seeing from an understandably qualitative standpoint. You don't want to isolate the customer. I appreciate that. But just even qualitatively, any reads on sell-through in front of the MVM, and maybe specifically what initiatives you can or are executing to build that awareness and visibility in front of the MVM, which is obviously a huge amplifier.

Adam L Michaels

Yeah. So thanks. So on Costco, so a couple of things. One, it's actually already shipping. It's been shipping for a few weeks now.

You're correct that you will get the MVM, the booklet, I think, in a couple of weeks. Something my wife and I sort of that's our weekend activity when we get that MVM, the book. So that's going to happen at the end of the month, and that's when the discount's going to be. But we are in the quote-unquote "MVM" right now in the sense of the product is selling nicely already. So that's the first part. The second part, it's the great work that Lauren's doing. I've shared in the past. We amplify on Instacart. So Costco is all over Instacart. It gets great awareness. We do programming on Instacart, and we see great results. Actually, I shared some last quarter. A lot of the customers that we're getting on Instacart are actually new to the brand. So Instacart gives us that type of data.

Things we're doing there. On other sites, we're doing a great job and great partnership with Walmart. We invest behind on their search and on their website. Walmart does a great job getting more and more. You guys listen to the calls, I'm sure, on getting more stuff through their digital. Well, guess what? They're actually helping us by amplifying that. Same thing we're doing on Publix. There's programming that Lauren does that actually is pretty cool. It's like proximity. As you're driving down, was it Jog Road or wherever? My parents would be proud. I'd remember that. But there seems to be a Publix on every street in Florida. As you're driving through, you'll actually get texts on, "Hey, why don't you stop in?" So what we talk about a lot, and the team makes fun of me, I don't leave anything to chance, right?

When we get a new item in, what levers can we pull to accelerate that? Hang tags, things at the point of sale. Yeah, we're doing all things like that when new items come in. We absolutely do not just hope it does well. We definitely chum the waters.

Brian Holland

That's great. I could go in a bunch of different directions, but I'll just nail it down to one more question. Just a sense, you mentioned locking in chicken for calendar 2026 or getting close to that. Any sense, just even directionally, where you're kind of locking in at what levels relative to 2025? I understand that the sole purpose of this is not to get necessarily the lowest price, but it's more so about driving visibility.

But still, it's just interesting with the direction that chicken's moving. You've got pricing in, and obviously, that was a headwind for you over the last 12 months. Just a sense of what kind of benefit that could provide to you looking out to 2026.

Adam L Michaels

Yeah. So there's probably three things that I'd love to talk about, and I'm glad you bring it up. So the first one is the power. Again, there's just so many benefits from the most recent acquisition with Crown One, but one of a hundred is that it literally doubled our chicken needs. And that brought us to another level with who we're reaching out to and who's interested in selling us chicken. Remember, when we first started, it was a million, right? It's nothing like a little bit of chicken. Now we're literally talking about tens of millions of pounds of chicken every year.

And Anthony Morello is doing an incredible job. So the first thing is we're getting better looks. People want to work with us, and we're getting better pricing from our scale. Second thing is chicken is better now. It's not going to last forever. We're all aware of that. But it's good timing, and we're seeing some positive pricing relative to what we had to deal with this year. As a reminder, and you've been following all of this, this is the second worst year for chicken prices after the year after COVID. The average price for the year is going to be the second highest it's ever been on record. So it's great to see that the numbers are getting better.

The third, and I do want to actually save some of this until our investor day in February, but what's really wonderful is the Crown business actually gave us a different way to think about our business. And as much as we've been grandma quality, which we always have, we're thinking about being even more premium. And Chris's past experience helps us think about where we want to be when we grow up of sorts. And I think that there's some exciting news that we're looking to share to become even more grandma quality, but let's hold that to the investor day.

Brian Holland

Excellent. Appreciate all that. Best of luck.

Adam L Michaels

Thanks, Brian.

Luke Zimmerman

Our next question comes from Eric Des Lauriers with Craig-Hallum. You may proceed with your question.

Eric Des Lauriers

Great. Thank you for taking my questions, and congrats on yet another impressive quarter here.

So one of the things I wanted to touch on was the planned SKU rationalization of some Crown products. Just wondering if you could shed some more color on essentially, I mean, what stage you're in in terms of identifying which SKUs to rationalize, and then in terms of actually working through those inventories. And if you're able to, just provide a little bit more color on the SKUs that you are rationalizing. If you are, presumably, they all do not meet your margin requirements, so wondering if there's any customer product type or geographic concentrations to be aware of. Thank you.

Adam L Michaels

Yeah. Thanks, Eric. So I think we're doing. So we've started that. We've had meetings about that. That's work that Chris and Lauren are leading. This wasn't the first thing we wanted to do, right? So first, we want to understand.

We wanted Chris to have those meetings with those customers. He's actually already had face-to-face meetings already with two of our top three new customers. And the first meeting wasn't about, "Hey, here are the things I'm taking away from you." So we knew that the SKU rationalization was probably secondary to a couple of other things. All the work that Skip's doing, we don't need to rationalize the SKUs if Skip's able to turn everything around and COGS go down because we could optimize how we produce it. So what I can tell you is the team's already had meetings. They've started to put that list together. And again, the intention, I wish every product was wildly profitable, wildly high enough in volume to justify it, right? Everyone knows MOQ, minimum order quantities.

So the bias is not to rationalize just so we could share with investors that we've cut SKUs. But the team is absolutely clear. It's all about gross margin, right? We have to be around a year from now, right? So we need to have the right margin profile. And Chris and Lauren are all over it. So they understand everything, all the products. We're putting it together. The Bayshore team is doing an incredible job helping us accelerate some of it. So we've started on it, but we wanted it was very intentional that we weren't going to do anything until January because Chris wanted to understand all the products, all the customers, meet with all the customers, and then we'll start that in January. So on track.

Eric Des Lauriers

All right. That's all very helpful. I appreciate all that color there and makes sense to me.

Just last one for me. It's a bit of a kind of conceptual question. Just wondering how you're thinking about trade promotion, I guess, target levels over the next year or so. Just wondering how the Crown integration may or may not impact near-term trade promotion levels.

Adam L Michaels

Yeah. So a couple of things. So the first one is, as a reminder, most, if not all, of the Crown's products are private label. So they have a very either very low to negligible, Anthony Gruber would tell me, de minimis trade rate. So that would, on a percentage basis, might lower the number overall. That's not to say that that's initially. I still am very bullish. I always tell Chris, but Chris is the ultimate boss. I want to invest. A, we have it. And two, it's all about growing the velocity and getting us some new customers through trial.

I would tell you that I still want to push it up. If I were to, I was really happy. Probably Q1, I think Q1, we were north of like 6%. Maybe that was a little high. Then we went down to like 3% and 4% over the past couple of quarters. I'd love it a little bit higher, but I leave that completely to Chris on, is the ROI as high as it could be. Remember, sorry. I probably should take something back and say it's not about how much trade spend. It's how do you get efficient and high ROI trade spend. And that is the lens from which we use. But I will continue to push Chris and Nick on his team to find high ROI trade spend. And then equally, I'd say the same thing with Lauren and her team on marketing spend.

The ROAS, like I said, double digits. It's incredible some of the things that Lauren and Jessica are doing to get some great ROAS, return on advertising spend. So I'll continue to push the team, but it has to be high ROI.

Eric Des Lauriers

I appreciate you taking my color and excuse me, taking my questions. And thanks again for the call.

Adam L Michaels

Thanks, Eric.

Luke Zimmerman

Our next question comes from George Kelly with Roth Capital Partners. You may proceed with your question.

George Kelly

Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. And congrats on a nice quarter. So a few for you. First, it looks like stripping out Crown organic growth was close to 20% in the quarter. I'm curious if you could give the breakdown between volume and pricing.

Adam L Michaels

Yeah. Super proud of that as well. So about 80%. So actually, it was about 80% of it was volume-driven.

So while it's kind of funny, I don't know which one I want to see more. I think it's the right level, but I was super proud of getting the right pricing. This is about 20% price-driven. That's important. You see, right? It's not about getting a lot. It's about maintaining our gross margin. We have been speaking, and I'm very thrilled to speak to you about lower chicken prices. But equally, we all understand because everyone reads the paper every morning, beef prices are through the roof, right? Up 50%. The worst herd in 73 years. That has been creating real headwinds for us. So Chris has done a great job, has great partnerships with our customers to share the data, right? We have both actuals, and we actually have third-party forecasted data. And it's collaborative. We share with our customers. We don't want any more gross margin, right?

We just need to maintain what we have. And that means that we have to strategically and targeted raise prices when commodities get too high. So I really like that on that 20 range. But then equally, buy me another CPG company that's growing 80% in volume. I mean, it's just pretty awesome, the work we're doing. And again, going back to those three tenets that Chris is leading on, getting more items into every store, getting our velocities higher. You guys read all the time what's happening in the deli prepared set and getting into new stores like you saw with Target and Food Lion and others.

George Kelly

Okay. Okay. That's great. And then next question for me. Adam, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're transitioning to a make-to-stock organization. I was wondering if you could give a little more context on the progress there.

I guess just as background, how much growth were you kind of leaving on the table because you weren't sort of fully on shelf or availability wasn't always there? As you embark on that, do you feel like your inventory at retail is now in a good place, or should we anticipate there being a few quarters of retail inventory fill as you execute on that?

Adam L Michaels

Yeah. First, there's no, I'm not sure, inventory fill. From a customer perspective, they're pulling normally. They're seeing no difference. The difference is the fact that we always have supply for them. Our service levels are perfect or near perfect. Very excited about this idea of make-to-stock. We have great partnerships, third-party logistics. For instance, I'll give you a for instance. Nearly 100% of everything that's going out in Costco was pre-built.

Eric and his team in East Rutherford did just an amazing job. So what that means is anytime Costco needs anything, it's there no matter what. If they need extra accidentally, it's there no matter what. I would tell you when I first started three years ago, I don't think we left anything on the table per se because, quite honestly, we just didn't have the demand, right? If I have someone to blame for this, it's Chris and his amazing sales team for just doing so well that there's just constant demand and pull and new items. So I think this is a logical evolution of our company, right? My days at Mondelez, PepsiCo, they didn't. We didn't wait for someone to order some Oreos for us to then start to produce them, right? Everything was a make-to-stock.

So yeah, no, I think this is the logical next step. We're doing exceptionally well. It provides better results for our customers, like I told you, and service levels. But honestly, it's better for us because we're not rushing. We're not doing triple overtime eight days a week because we've fallen behind. Now we're able to do it with lower overtime and better service levels. So yeah, so I'm loving it. The goal is for all of our major items with multiple customers, right? So the idea there is you don't get stuck with it. And great work that Skip and his team are doing constantly, I see. You guys know I look at everything all day Sunday.

And I get a report from Eric, actually a couple of times a week, but I review it in detail every Sunday on every single item that we're building in stock, looking at the velocities, looking at the movements. And the team gets love notes on Sunday on if something's a little slower than I would have expected.

George Kelly

Okay. Okay. And then last question for me is on gross margin. Just trying to think through the next few quarters. With respect to Crown, can you give Crown's gross margin in 3Q? And then you talked about it reaching that kind of mid-20 range over the next year. Is that going to be a linear ramp, or how should we sort of map that out?

And then secondarily, the legacy business. Curious if you can give any of your expectations just on the next quarter or two and high level for fiscal year 2027. And that's all I had. Thank you.

Adam L Michaels

Yeah. Thanks, George. So remember, while obviously we have three plants, I'm not telling you I'm not looking at those three plants. There is so much, and I'm proud of this. Everything melds together. So I've given you examples that we're buying one when we're buying from a procurement perspective for oil. We make one order of oil, and then we distribute it across the three facilities. Or equally, there are items now that are made in multiple facilities. So it's hard, not hard. It's less relevant to look at individual, the gross margin is this. I will tell you, obviously, we look at everything.

Of course, we knew from the acquisition. Of course, we knew that the Bayshore legacy business had a lower margin. We're seeing everything pick up. When I look at whatever SKU 1, 2, 3, 4 meatballs that are in multiple locations, I could see that that number is rising week to week. Another Sunday activity is looking at our top 25 SKUs, the weekly margins. And I'm seeing those move appropriately. So we will get to, like I committed to, definitely by the end of next year. I think I said 12-18 months. You won't know the difference between Bayshore margins from Farmingdale's margins, from East Rutherford's margins. And we're on track to do it. I would argue ahead of where I expected. So that's what's happening with Bayshore.

Obviously, if you know that from the legacy business, the Bayshore numbers are lower, and you see where our margins are now, you could see that our legacy business has clearly the math. Even so, my son's a data analytics now at WashU. Give him props. Even he could tell you that, well, if one number's lower and we're moving up, the legacy business must be quite a bit higher. So we are definitely seeing our legacy business move up. That's a function of great production and efficiency that Skip's doing. Chicken commodities helping us, with a little bit of headwinds from beef. But we are seeing a much healthier business today than we were early this year.

George Kelly

Okay.

Ryan Meyers

Our next question comes from Ryan Meyers with Lake Street Capital. You may proceed with your question.

Luke Zimmerman

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the strong quarter.

Just kind of curious, obviously, better than expected gross margins even with the Crown integration. So as you guys have owned this business now for a couple of months, I mean, do you think this integration is going better than expected, as expected? Because it seems like on the surface here, things are continuing to trend very, very favorably and positive with the acquisition.

Adam L Michaels

Yeah. No. And again, Ryan, that's a testament to the team, both the Bayshore team and their openness and eagerness. That's the word. They are truly eager. They are excited. So many of the folks from Bayshore have come to East Rutherford. How many tons of people to Farmingdale? It's just truly, from a cultural perspective, that is exceeding, massively exceeding expectations. And I'm so appreciative of it. Production-wise, we moved faster than I expected.

So, thanks to Skip and team on cross-producing items in multiple locations, exceeded expectations on the procurement and how quickly Alberto was able to centralize everything. So, I'm really happy with it. Has everything been absolutely perfect? No. I'm not sure which ones yet, but I'm sure there's something that hasn't been perfect. I go there every single week. I really enjoy it a lot. Skip's there multiple times a week. And no, I'm just really the fact that it's so close to the Farmingdale facility just really unlocks a lot, actually more than I would have expected. So yeah, overall, I would definitely tell you exceeding expectations.

Ryan Meyers

Yeah. No, that's great to hear. And then congrats on the two new customer wins.

Just curious, as you think about the 2,000 or so stores at Target and then the roughly 1,100 at Food Lion, is there additional capacity that you think you guys need to bring online, or do you feel like you, for the most part, will be able to unlock this capacity through the now three facilities that you guys have?

Adam L Michaels

That's why there was a little bit of clairvoyance there, right? So the fact that we got 42,000 sq ft of space accidentally with the Bayshore acquisition, that's a huge unlock. So they were probably roughly at, I don't know, let's call it 50%. And there is, in the earlier question from Eric on there'll be some SKU rationalization, right? We want to make sure it's not just about producing, right? My team knows that they don't get credit for revenue. They get credit for profitable revenue.

So there'll be some SKU rationalization that will give us even more space. And then, as I've shared with many of you, we just took over in our New Jersey facility. We're in a building that had a wall in the middle. We actually took over that other space. So very excited, Skip. Actually brought in some new folks, Shane and Carlos, to help us expand. And that's actually already happening, and we'll start early next year. That will unlock additional capacity. That almost doubles our New Jersey facility. So between the expanded New Jersey facility and the building out the Bayshore facility, I feel good that we could double our business just with that. Got it. And of course, most importantly, I don't stop.

Maybe I took a day or two off, but already back in the market looking at what the next acquisition could be, which gives us more space.

Luke Zimmerman

Our next question comes from Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group. You may proceed with your question.

Anthony Vendetti

Thanks. Adam, I was wondering if you could give us a count now with the Target rollout, Food Lion rollout. How many stores are you in at this point today? And then from the Crown acquisition, what capacity is that at right now? And has that enabled you to roll out? How much of that is coming from the Target rollout and Food Lion? How much is that coming from your existing facilities versus the new Crown facility? And then as a last question, Costco, what's the opportunity to continue to build out that relationship? Thanks so much.

Adam L Michaels

Yep.

So, the first question: I could get back to you on the exact number if we're at 12 now. And once we get to full rollout at Target and Food Lion, that's another three. So I don't know. Let's call it 15,000. But I'm happy to get back to you on the actual number. And again, it's going to take some time to do the full rollout, just as well as we did with Walmart. I am very patient when it comes to executing with excellence. So I'm not in any rush to get to every single store on the first day. So that's your first question. Second question: maybe I won't accept the premise of your question in the sense that we're all family. All three facilities, we don't talk about legacy, old, this or that.

That was a great learning I had from my Mondelez days where 10 years later, people are still talking about being Cadbury versus Nabisco. We are one team the day the acquisition happened. Lauren did an amazing job and put all the posters and everything up. We're one team. So to your point, to your question, yeah, Food Lion, I believe, is coming out of the Bayshore facility. Target is likely coming out of the New Jersey facility. They're branded sleeves. So Skip looks every day at how do we be optimal. We make sure when we speak to customers and since the acquisition, we're getting sort of certified. So there's some customers that want to know exactly which facility they're coming out of, and they'll do audits. So they've already started to do that in Bayshore.

Our strategy is our product can be made in any one of our three facilities any day of the week. So it's where do we optimize? Obviously, Bayshore right this minute has more capacity, has more space, right? 42,000 sq ft versus about 25,000 sq ft in Farmingdale and about 25,000 sq ft in New Jersey. So we're definitely pushing volume there. But we look at it as one network. So it's wherever the best place to produce it at any given day. And it actually might change from day to day. You had a third question on Costco?

Anthony Vendetti

Yes.

Adam L Michaels

I forgot. I apologize. What was the question on Costco?

Anthony Vendetti

Just what's the opportunity to continue to expand that relationship there? Would you say you're at about a 50% saturation there?

Or where are you in terms of the ability to make that a more lucrative relationship and how much runway do you have there?

Adam L Michaels

Yeah. I love actually all my partnerships, all of our partnerships with our customers. Some of them are different, but they're all great. Talking about a question that I could not even begin to answer, the opportunity is huge with Costco, and every day that goes by, thanks to Scott and the team, great relationships now every day with all eight of the regions, so remember, just three years ago when Anthony and I started, we had a relationship with just one, right? With just the Northeast, and maybe we do one rotation all year long just once with the Northeast. Now, every day we're having conversations. Remember, we could be and it's not one or the other.

We actually meet all the time with individual regions. And we might decide to do a rotation with just one. Equally, we have similar conversations on how do we do national buys, which we did last year, or digital MVMs, which we did earlier this year, or MVMs, which we're doing now. So I love the opportunity. Why? Great customer, great consumers, right? They're our type of consumers. Quality, grandma quality. They're growing. So I think it's truly limitless with Costco. And thanks to Scott and the team, we have great partnership with them that we're speaking to them all the time with tons of items, right? We're doing the beef meatballs now, the cheese stuffed chicken meatballs. Remember last year we did the sauce. We did the meatloaf. We did the sausage and peppers. They're having tons of conversations now about some new items.

So yeah, I think that there's a lot of opportunity. I'm very bullish on Club and Mass. And I like the Aldi, Lidls of the world for next year. I understand what's happening in the marketplace. I know consumers' purse strings are tight. And I think the winners are going to be in the Club and Mass channel where we have great relationships.

Anthony Vendetti

Okay. Great. Thanks so much. I'll hop back in the queue. Appreciate it.

Adam L Michaels

Thank you, Anthony. Any other questions, operator?

Luke Zimmerman

This now concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Adam Michaels for closing comments.

Adam L Michaels

Thank you, operator. And thank you again to each of you for joining us today. This quarter showed what this organization can do when every part of the engine is aligned. Our sales and marketing teams continue to open meaningful new doors.

Our operations team is scaling efficiently. With discipline, our finance and people teams are building the foundation required for long-term profitable growth. The early progress with Bayshore is already strengthening our platform, expanding our capabilities, and increasing our access to high-value customers. With major retail wins coming online, growing momentum in Club and Mass, and a unified network that can support significantly higher volume, we are entering the next phase of our growth with confidence. As always, we appreciate our investors' continued support and look forward to updating you on our execution in the quarters to come. Finally, as we head into the eve of the holiday season, I want to thank you. I want to say thank you to the men and women of Mama's that make me so proud to be called their teammate. Happy holidays to all.

Luke Zimmerman

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This now concludes today's conference. Please disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.
