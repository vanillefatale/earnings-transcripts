[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies.

Brent Thill
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Neil, regarding Deltek, I'm curious if you could just give everyone a sense of what you're baking into the '26 guide and how you're protecting against another potential government shutdown.

Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Yes, go ahead, Jason.

Jason Conley
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So I think we are not assuming an improvement this year. The fourth quarter was depressed by the perpetual license revenue. As I talked about, most of GovCon Enterprise still buys perpetual licenses. So that's what drove our lower organic in AS in the fourth quarter. So we don't think that's going to repeat next year. So we do have a comp benefit but otherwise we're not really assuming improvement in that market until we see it.

Brent Thill
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And on Procare, Neil, what do you think needs to happen to get that back meeting expectations?

Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think it's -- just to go through a little bit of what we talked about in the prepared remarks and then add a little bit more to it. So hey, the business is the leader in the marketplace. It is the clear leader. We've done a lot of good things there. We sort of cleaned up and fixed the payments, cost infrastructure and processing capability. We fixed and improved the go-to-market. So we're competing and winning the marketplace. We're winning a majority of the jump balls versus the primary competitor.

And so the problem now is just push to the right. So now we're winning these opportunities, and we're slow to implement the software, which means we're slow to implement the payments, and that's the next sort of objective in front of the team there. So once we get that done, we feel much better about that. It's a completely fixable problem. It's one of the problems that you don't like to have problems generally, but when you do have new ones that are eminently fixable, which this one is the larger problem would be if we had a competitive situation or something like that, which we do not have.

Your next question comes from Clarke Jeffries with Piper Sandler.

Clarke Jeffries
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

I wondered if specifically on the GovCon business, you could maybe give a rank order of the kind of appropriation bills, what would have the most impact? Or within Deltek's exposure, what segments of the government getting those appropriation bills passed would be most significant?

Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So I'll just draw back to the OBBB. And this is, as you know, we're not -- Deltek doesn't have direct exposure to the government. It's our customers that are the federal contact -- that have the direct exposure to the government, just to remind everybody.

The OBBB is heavy on defense -- Department of War, Department of Defense and DHS funding and spending, that tends -- those categories tend to have larger percentage of contractor spend. It could be north of 50% of the whole category. It can be contractor spend, so that's definitely a tailwind. The civilian programs tend to have lower percentage. So it's not necessarily a bad thing for Deltek's customers, but it's certainly better on the current appropriations, the OBBB.

Clarke Jeffries
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Perfect. And then the last 2 years hovered around $3 billion deployed towards acquisitions. Wondering if you could talk about expectations for how much you might deploy in '26. What scenario might push you towards a number closer to $4 billion or a number closer to the $2 billion? So what are you factoring into the deployment outlook for '26?

Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

As we mentioned there's about $6 billion sort of is what the forward capacity is over the next 12 months. We have the 2 levers available to us on the capital, the M&A and the buyback. On the M&A side, the thing for us -- I've been here 15 years. Jason has been here 20. When you're building a business that has an M&A lever, we never view the amount of capital next 12 months in the budget or we got to spend it because we're building a business that's going to own businesses in the perpetuity. So you have to buy very high-quality businesses at an appropriate price.

And so that discipline guides us. So it's hard to set an expectation that says we'd be -- we're going to get X dollars deployed against the $3 billion -- $6 billion, excuse me, in M&A or buyback, but we like having both levers available to us, and we're just going to do what's best objectively to compound cash flow per share at the best rate we can.

Jason Conley
Executive VP & CFO

I will say that we think this -- coming into this year, I think the market is ripe for more assets to become available. I mean we've been very proactive the last couple of years with -- in a very muted market. So as I mentioned, I think it's a net positive for us, but we'll just stay disciplined and focused.

Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Don't mistake anything I'm saying, like I was just saying, as Jason said, the opportunity -- the number of deals, the number -- the amount of LP pressure on the GPs and private equity just continues to mount. There's going to be -- there's an aging portfolio of very high-quality assets and number of those assets that we have relationship with and are meeting with management teams and becoming the preferred owner, all that is very, very ripe for opportunity, but we're going to remain, as we always do, disciplined.

Finally, on that, over the last really 3 years -- 2.5 or 3 years, we've really leaned in and built capacity for tuck-ins and bolt-ons. That's a more predictable pace. I think we did 7 or maybe 8 small tuck-in acquisitions last year, that'll be more sort of predictable because it's a lower dollar per transaction but more of them.

Operator

Your next question comes from Joseph Vruwink with Baird.

Joseph Vruwink
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Great. On AI, when would you expect to get to the point of quantifying what AI means for Roper at maybe a more precise level? I think it's evident in certain areas already, the Aderant call out their mid-teens growth, they're 10 points above the segment. I would imagine customers want the cloud as part of their AI initiatives and so there's an inherent uplift and positive correlation between Roper and AI for the legal space. Can you do that more holistically and attribute some of the organic improvement ex Deltek you're already seeing and say that's directly or indirectly related to AI investments?

Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Yes, so appreciate the question. We spend a fair amount of time talking about that internally. Just a couple guiding principles that we have internally is, one, we're not going to AI wash or allocate revenue like other companies have done or doing. We're not going to say X dollars R&D, so therefore Y dollars of revenue is AI related. So we're not going to AI wash our revenue stream.

That said, we do aspire to be able to report a number, like AI revenue SKU related is X or Y. Unfortunately, if we do that, I mean we're going to monetize AI in more ways than just AI SKUs. It's going to be cloud uplift. It's going to be in packaging. There's going to be lots of ways that we monetize this. So this is actually -- it says simple, it does pretty hard from how we're going to be able to sort of report this where it's credible.

At the end of the day, Joe, you highlight the most important thing, which is we believe this is a TAM -- meaningful TAM expander for us, which means it should be a growth driver for us, and you'll see it show up initially in bookings and eventually into the recurring or reoccurring base, so we see that at Aderant, see at CentralReach. We'd expect to see it across several of our businesses starting this year. More broadly, as we sort of write the chapters on Roper, 2025, the chapter in AI would be how we learned to develop the initial set of products across our software business. Essentially, every one of our software businesses either has or is right on the precipice of having AI-related product to deliver to our customers.

'26, I think the chapter is going to be how we commercialize, how do you sell, deploy, drive implementation and ultimately sort of monetize all of the product. And so that's going to be the journey of learning for us across the portfolio organization. We look forward to providing updates on that as we get through the year.

Joseph Vruwink
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Great. That's helpful. On your approach to guidance this year, I think it's very clear that you're going to let the upside come to you and future changes are going to happen. As you see it, can you maybe put some guardrails in magnitude of what that could ultimately mean? And I'm thinking in the past you've talked about how your current portfolio could be capable of 7% and in a best case scenario, 8% to 9%, that's more of a long-term framework. Within FY '26, if things go right and you get some redirection and where the pressures within the portfolio have been, what sort of upside possibility could there be?

Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So I would say the long term -- to first point, the destination, if you will, the longer term, certainly not a '26 comment. The longer-term entitled growth in the portfolio, we still have conviction is north of 8%. We go company by company about what their entitled realistically achievable growth can be and so that number sort of the target destination has not changed.

We are definitely, as you've heard from our commentary, taking a much more appropriate and balanced view for the initial guide here. No improvement at Deltek on the government contracting side, no DAT market recovery actually underwriting a slight decline in Neptune. And so if you sort of thumb each one of those, I don't want to get into order of magnitude of what it could look like, but I would say it definitely tilts more conservative than this past year, for instance.

Your next question comes from Dylan Becker with William Blair.

Dylan Becker
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Maybe kind of following up on one of Joe's questions, too. I think the Deltek perpetual piece makes sense, but you also called out some softness on nonrecurring due to some of those cloud migrations and maybe that's just kind of rev rec of upfront for ratable. I guess as you think about kind of AI's opportunity to accelerate this modernization and cloud journey given kind of the heavy maintenance space you still have there, how do you think about kind of that trade-off in those long-term economics? It seems favorable. I think it's kind of evident in the subscription bookings in that low double-digit framework, but maybe kind of walk through some of the nuance between those as well, too, if you can.

Jason Conley
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, certainly. Appreciate the question. I think we've seen some of this just in our AS segment over the last year's nonrecurring revenue has been sort of flattish up a little bit here and there because some of our businesses have moved more to the cloud, be it Aderant or in recent years, PowerPlan. We see that at Deltek is going to be a significant opportunity. So that's a part of our thinking in '26. Deltek's really put a lot of AI functionality into their cloud product and so some of these large government contract customers are contemplating going to the cloud, and they have a big push for that.

So you're right that will obviously increase customer lifetime value, but it'll have a more muted impact in year. So we thought through a little bit of those dynamics this year and I think that's probably the biggest area where we will see that because a lot of our -- the rest of our businesses are sort of on their cloud journey, but they will continue, to your point, to include only AI features in the cloud and so that will just increase adoption as we go forward.

Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And just to add to what Jason said, we don't expect a pronounced J curve because we have a very large installed base that's on-premise. That's going to lift -- that is lifting and shifting at 2 to 3x recurring. So it's -- the J curve is less pronounced because you're converting an existing recurring base at a higher level. And as you sort of, if you will, attrib or convert net new perpetual to recurring. So they offset one another, and we think we have that harnessed in our guidance.

Dylan Becker
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Okay. Great. And then maybe, Neil, for you, too, on the topic between platform and bolt-on M&A, I guess, could you kind of give us a sense if you see any opportunity maybe as a part of AI, maybe not, but given kind of the current backdrop to accelerate some of the initiatives in one effort. I know we've built out kind of the bolt-on team. There's a little bit more visibility into those platform valuations maybe have come down to a particular level as well. But just kind of think about kind of the mix between capital deployments between bolt-on and platform, if you can.

Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Always hard to predict mix. I can tell you that the -- if there is a -- generally speaking, if there's a rank order, bolt-ons or tuck-ins are going to be first order because they are advancing sort of the organic growth and strategic direction of one of our platform businesses. At the same time, you always have a little bit of back-office G&A synergy which enables to sort of buy down the initial purchase price pretty quickly and then you get to the growth orientation. So that continues and will always be a focus of ours.

What we see, by the way, on that front is it takes a little bit of time as we added the resources, they get to know the company, they build a relationship with our companies, they build a relationship with sponsors and targets and founders. I think something like 60% of our pipeline for bolt-ons is either proprietary or founder-driven. That's a completely new motion for us. That would not have been the case 3 years ago. I think that bodes well, but these things do take time to matriculate through the system and mature to where they can become actionable.

On the platform side, it's a -- the number of opportunities and the quality of assets is very interesting. The question on the table is going to be what happens relative to valuation. We've never been a short-term next 12-month multiple arbitrager. So we're not going to do that. But we definitely have to sort of -- we have to look at buybacks versus bolt-ons versus platforms on what is the best long-term compounding in terms of value-creation opportunities for us.

Your next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel.

Brad Reback
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I know you guys gave the software bookings for the entire year. Can you give us what it was in 4Q?

Jason Conley
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, it was up high single digits and that is with Deltek being down in the low double-digit area. Actually, Deltek's SaaS was strong but like I mentioned, perpetual was down meaningfully. Yes, the rest of the portfolio performed pretty well. Vertafore had a strong quarter off of a really tough comp last year. So they're continuing to just have success in 2025 and that should be good for them for '26. And then as I mentioned last quarter, health care has been really strong for us and that was the same in the fourth quarter.

Brad Reback
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Great. Neil, this is the second quarter in a row you've missed expectations, and you're guiding to a back half acceleration in '26. So maybe take a moment and help us understand where the incremental conservatism is in the '26 guide versus the last couple of quarters?

Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Sure. So we did say -- and we're certainly disappointed over the last couple quarters, but we did say this time last quarter we had a wider range of outcome, fan of outcome, especially because of the uncertainty at Deltek. And so while disappointing, we tried to be sort of very straightforward in that regard.

I think for this year, I said it before, I'll say it again, when you look at where we're exiting this year, look at '25 compared to '26 and you just go -- let me back up. When you look at '25, the initial guide versus where we ended up, it really reconciles to 3 things we talked about. It's Deltek because of GovCon, it's Neptune because of the dynamics we talked about and it's Procare. That almost fully reconciles the difference between the initial guide and where we ended up.

You then have that in mind, you take it, you carry it forward. We're assuming in 2026, there's no improvement in Deltek. There is no acceleration at DAT. There's actually -- we're underwriting a modest decline at Neptune versus '25. And the only thing that sort of -- then you get the accretion to organic growth from Subsplash and CentralReach that turn organic this year. And then we have this easing second half sort of nonrecurring. So optically, it looks like an acceleration through the year, but when you look at the pieces, it's actually pretty steady, say, for the things that we just said.

Jason Conley
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And just to remind you that, all the CentralReach and Subsplash becomes organic second half. So it's got to create some of that ramp. And I would just call out, too, just again, just a small comp -- a couple comp issues. Foundry gets a little bit better this year, and I know it's small dollars, but in network, it matters. And then we had the first quarter of '25, a pretty depressed network number because we were comping against a bigger number in '24. So that comp goes away. So there's some math too, just going from '25 to '26.

Your next question comes from Terry Tillman with Truist Securities.

Terrell Tillman
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

The first one's going to be on Deltek. The second one, the follow-up is going to be on DAT. But on Deltek, and I know these months or these part of the quarters are probably less seasonally strong, but did you actually see any improvement in order volumes for perpetual in December or January? And also with Deltek, are the effects of DOGE kind of lessening? Or is that still impactful? And then I had a follow-up.

Jason Conley
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So Terry, this is Jason. I think the -- December is always stronger than the other months and that's just the natural kind of inertia of how orders flow in Deltek. I will say we had 2 large contractor -- government contractor deals that slipped. So it was like right at the end. And so we think they'll both land in the first half of next year, but we've also sort of hedged that just in case. But -- so usually, we get some big deals, and they were right at the finish line and they didn't close, but they're still in the queue, and we still think we're going to...

Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Close the rest of this year.

Jason Conley
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, exactly this year.

Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

And just to pick up on that, Terry, as well, just to add, the -- while the signatures on paper are slower because of the shutdown, the commercial activity, the pipeline build has actually been encouraging. It's been encouraging throughout. It's because all the -- this is an environment, unfortunately, that our customers live in and they sort of -- they're subject to the vagaries of what's happening in the government, but they have a business to run and they have contracts that are likely going to get awarded, and they have to sort of manage sort of our software in that regard. And so there's no competitive issue here at all. Let's take it hasn't been asked, but 0 competitive issue here. It's just deals that are building that are pushed to the right a little bit given the uncertainty. DOGE, I would say, is, to your question, is lingering impact, but it's not the topic that anybody's talking about the way it was in the first, third -- the first half of the year of last year.

Terrell Tillman
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Got it. I appreciate that. And just a follow-up is on DAT. Do you see ARPU lift continuing to play out through the year and are you on track for that autonomous kind of load matching technology innovation to play out in '27?

Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So we do expect ARPU to continue improving, growing in 2026. There's a couple reasons for that. One is you just have like-for-like pricing opportunity that'll sort of get cascaded in during the year as it normally does. But for -- the second reason is we have more value to sort of sell to both sides of the network. And so you're going to get -- in the past, it was just load board, so it's load board and pricing. Now it's load board and automation. It's load board and data. It's load board and a number of things on both the carrier and the broker side.

In terms of the automated matching, we're -- it's early days but we're encouraged by the progress. The tech -- unambiguously, the technology does the job. Let's just be clear. It is the ability for a broker to tender to the DAT One platform and automatically match a load and have a carrier pick it up and complete the commerce with payment sort of overlay across all that. It works and it's working every day in the marketplace. The #1 focus of that business is to build both sides of the network that starts on the broker side by getting native integrations with their TMS systems. And you have seen and will continue to see during 2026 a cascade of announcements about the various TMSs that we're integrating with that allows the brokering or tendering to our platform to be native and the work for the brokers.

And then we continue to build the carrier side of the network. It's got to be a high trust, no fraud environment. That's part of the core technology that we have and we're integrating. So early days, but we like the tendering percentage, we like the completion percentages. We like the factoring percentages, and we'll want to see that business scale as Jason and Shannon and Satish and the team at DAT look at this on a monthly basis.

Your next question comes from Ken Wong with Oppenheimer.

Hoi-Fung Wong
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

You guys are guiding the 5% to 6% organic for '26. As we think about 1Q first half with a lot of faster growth businesses coming in second half 4Q and no Deltek tailwind, like is there the possibility that you could be below that 5% low end? Any context there so we could properly level set our numbers?

Jason Conley
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. No, I don't think so. We're kind of thinking for AS we'll be sort of in the mid-single-digit range with nonrecurring being flattish and the recurring reoccurring being like mid-single digit plus which is consistent with Q4 levels. I mean you're not -- we're not going to have the same nonrecurring decline like we did in the fourth quarter. And then as you mentioned, the second half gets better on the CentralReach turning organic. And we've got this, the nonrecurring, as I just mentioned, we get a better comp in the fourth quarter. So not a lot of -- I would just say not a lot of go-get in that second half number.

And then on NS, I think sort of the recurring revenue will be just sort of continue to be mid-single digit plus out of the gate. And then as we go throughout the year, Subsplash actually comes in, in the fourth quarter, so that'll be helpful. And so I think that's sort of how it sets up, nothing outside of that to call out.

Hoi-Fung Wong
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Got it. Really appreciate the color there. And then perhaps just any additional context you could provide in terms of what the new business activity pipeline conversion look like versus maybe the renewal business, term expansion, contraction? And any details would be helpful.

Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Ken, is that a broad portfolio question or specific to a business, broad, broad question?

Hoi-Fung Wong
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Yes, just like -- yes, correct. It's more of a broad kind of software selling kind of trends that you guys are noticing across the group.

Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

I understand the question. Yes, I would say we're broadly encouraged by what we saw in the finishing the year. The bookings and retention statistics were quite good. As you know, our enterprise -- our gross retention is in the mid-90s for our enterprise businesses. That's steady to tick up a little bit during 2025. And then in terms of the bookings activity, hey, while there's a little -- we expect there to be volatility quarter-to-quarter, low double-digit bookings growth in the year and being pretty broad-based with sort of weakness at Deltek, I think, is all you need to see. We -- and so it's been pretty good.

Operator

Your next question comes from George Kurosawa with Citi.

George Michael Kurosawa
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

You guys brought in some new AI leadership, Shane and Edward. Would love to hear a little bit about the team they're building out, what you have them focused on and if there's any kind of low-hanging fruit that learnings they can apply across the portfolio.

Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So we're excited to have Shane and Eddie join and the team they're starting to build out. 3 things they're generally focused on. First is it's all in pursuit of accelerating the top line goals, accelerating sort of our pace of AI product development and ultimately, shipping, selling monetization. That's where the focus is. So 3 subcomponents of that, it's coaching and teaching, right. Our businesses did a meaningfully above average, above expectation job in 2025, late '24 or '25, learning, making mistakes, learning, making mistakes, learning around AI, AI development, what works, what doesn't and getting products into the hands of customers. That was great to see.

But some of these -- a lot of these AI tasks are quite complicated, complex from a technical point of view. And also, unlike regular way software development, there's some art in this AI development. And so Shane and Eddie and the team they're bringing -- really bring just a history. These are people that studied machine learning and AI in university quite a while ago and spent their entire careers. They've seen a lot of pattern recognition. They're going to coach and teach our leadership teams, our technical leaders, our product teams on all things AI, ML related. That's one. Number two, they are going to build an AI sort of development strike team or accelerator team to where when there are -- a company might have more than it can do from its internal resources, and we'll supplement those teams to accelerate in some pockets.

And then third, there is in their first quarter with the business and they met with most of our software businesses there is clear opportunity for some reuse inside the portfolio, certain AI-based sort of capabilities we can sort of produce and sort of have, if you will, a Roper open source model where we can reuse some components and componentry. And so we're going to focus there. And early days, it's been just really great. They understand our culture, our teams have really engaged them, and they're just looking forward to scaling the team and getting to the work.

George Michael Kurosawa
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. I did also want to touch on the margin side. Core gross margins were up over 1 point in the quarter. Maybe just talk through the tailwinds there. How should we think about any sustainability to improvements?

Jason Conley
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean I think we've always said in our long-term incremental margins at the EBITDA lines around 45%, did a little bit better this year. I think as we go into next year, I think AS might be up a little bit. Network's going to be down just because we've got the full year of Convoy and our algo rolling through. And so that'll accrete up over time, but a little bit of a drag in '26. And then I think our TEP segment will be for the full year sort of flattish. We've got more consumables rolling through next year than normal, which has a little bit lower margin. And that's really more pronounced in the first half. So maybe down a little bit in TEP in the first half and then it'll improve throughout the year.

Operator

Your next question comes from Josh Tilton with Wolfe Research.

Joshua Tilton
Wolfe Research, LLC

Maybe just first kind of a simple high-level one on the guide for next year. I appreciate all the color that you gave on Deltek and DAT and Neptune, but if you were to take those 3 businesses aside and treat the rest of the organic business as one, like what would be the one line color on the rest of the organic business? Does the guidance assume that everything ex DAT, Neptune and Deltek gets better, stays the same, gets worse? Like how would you characterize what the rest of the business has to do that's baked into the guidance? Does that make sense?

Jason Conley
Executive VP & CFO

It does. Yes. So I mean, I would say broadly, it gets a little bit better, but not a lot, not meaningful enough to draw inflection. So that's baked in. I mean when you think about -- we finished around 5.4%, the deals are a tailwind. This nonrecurring in AS is going to be somewhat of a tailwind. Foundry does get a little bit better. And so maybe 10 basis points or so to the enterprise. And then really the swing factors, I talked about the comp in NS in Q1 of '25 that didn't repeat. Then you just talk about like the swing factors, it's all within Neptune, and that's what our low single-digit to mid-single-digit guidance has for TEP, and that's what kind of bridges you to the -- from the low to the high end.

Joshua Tilton
Wolfe Research, LLC

And then maybe just a quick follow-up. I understand that some businesses go organic in the second half. Is there any -- I don't know if conservatism is the right word, but is there any conservatism? Is there any learning that you saw following like kind of the little hiccups that you saw in Procare that you're kind of applying or embedding or assuming will happen as some of these inorganic businesses convert to organic in the second half of next year?

Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Josh, it's Neil. I'll take that one. So short answer is heck, yes, there's a lot of learning from our Procare governance, what worked, what didn't work and how we're governing both Subsplash and CentralReach. And we can spend more time talking about offline. But in essence, when we see a small variance in a monthly reporting package relative to one of the key levers in value creation plan, in Procare, we observe that variance for a longer time before we decided to take action to correct it. Now we immediately jump to a corrective action, a countermeasure. And we don't let small variances turn into large variances. And as a result, you have CentralReach that's ahead of the underwrite model and Subsplash is on the underwrite model for the outlooks for those businesses. Just -- we can get in much more detail when we have more time offline, but that's the essence of it.

Jason Conley
Executive VP & CFO

And I would just say that for CentralReach and Subsplash, feel good about the contribution in the second half, the path that we're on, bookings momentum, the recurring, the gross retention, just the path to get to that accretion in the second half, we feel very good about that.

Your next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.

Deane Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

This has come up several times today about the M&A bias and looking for durable cash flow compounding. I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts about how do you rank looking at absolute dislocations in some asset prices today versus what you perceive as where there might be a wider moat against AI in these assets. So how are you weighing those?

Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

I want to reframe, Deane, the question to make sure that we answer the right question. If not, you can correct us. And so the question is looking at both private and public companies that have a valuation dislocation, are we looking at that? And then how does the AI moat influence our thinking? Can you just reframe that? I want to make sure we answer the right question.

Deane Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Yes. So yes, I wasn't specifically talking about public valuations, but that would be great to hear that as well because you've done those in the past versus thinking more strategically about where there might be wider moats.

Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So I would -- so -- and feel free, we won't ding you on one of your questions if again, I answered the wrong question. We're always -- for the long history of Roper, we're always investing in these vertical market application-specific businesses with deep moats, right. And so that does not change. We believe in the AI world, these -- the moats where you're intimate with the customer, you have unique and proprietary data, you're embedded in high-frequency workflows where on-stack AI is easier to implement, easier to monetize and ultimately translates to the automation of tasks, which is this TAM expansion. We really like and are leaning in it. We're seeing it playing across our 21 software business days, so we'll continue to lean in that thesis from a capital deployment point of view.

That's really helpful. That's what I was looking for there. And just a quick one on Neptune, we've talked about the order delays. Is there -- how much of an impact is the spike in copper played? Is there a sticker shock? Is that -- does that need to be kind of rippled through the market to reprice? Just what's the impact there?

Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

I would say that -- what we talked about last quarter, largely in the bucket of tariffs, but it's tariffs, it's copper pricing, generally the shock to the cost structure of a water meter when we started in really July of last year pushing a surcharge to accommodate for that increase in cost of goods. It was definitely a shock in the system in Q3, and it really abated during Q4. So I think our base case assumption is that is really in the rearview mirror and set to the side. And moving forward, it's just about the normalization of volumes in the market sort of on the very tail end of the COVID spike in volumes, and now we're on the backside of that spike into more normalizing range of volumes in the market.

Your next question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen.

Joseph Giordano
TD Cowen, Research Division

I'm just curious how you're now weighing like in terms of capital deployment, like different, like timing horizons here, right. Like you have -- stock today is, I don't know, 15% below the average price of the buyback in the fourth quarter. You're trading at like almost a high single-digit free cash flow yield now. And it's a portfolio that you're intimately like close to relative to something that you might buy that drives top line that is something that inherently has more risk because you don't know it as well. Like how are you weighing something that -- like the certainty of what you know versus like the risk reward of something you don't know at the price that you're paying?

Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

So I'll take the first pass of that. I'm sure Jason will have some color he may want to add. So again, just to -- we've said it, it's on repeat, we'll say it again. The objective of M&A versus buybacks, sort of the levers available to us is what's the best risk-adjusted path to long-term cash flow per share compounding, period, full stop. We're totally objective and just passionate about the allocation of the 2. There's $6 billion available so a big sort of -- a large amount of capacity. On the buyback, we just -- the valuation dislocation is just -- is silly. And so we leaned into it in Q4, and we find it obviously more attractive today. And it's a great opportunity to drive long-term cash flow compound that way.

On top of that, we're very excited and confident about our future, right. I mean the growth, the AI, the leadership, the strategy, execution prowess, I mean all of it feels very, very good to us and what we see internally. At the same time, M&A is a real lever. I mean there's not -- to somewhat to my surprise, we introduced the buyback last quarter, there is commentary about, oh my gosh, is the M&A thesis not intact. That is one of the most absurd things I've heard in my 15 years at Roper. We are a preferred buyer of vertical market software leaders. We're absolutely preferred from a management point of view. We're preferred from a seller point of view. The pipeline is enormous.

The LP pressure is legit. The number of assets in private equity portfolio have to get liquidity are at levels we've not seen. So that thesis just needs to be eliminated from the talk track because it's not real. And so for us, it's balancing those 2. Buybacks are great in the short run. M&A generally is going to beat in the long run, and we like having the balance between the 2 options in front of us.

Jason Conley
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I would just add that around the confidence, and we've had just these unusual things happen with 3 of our businesses, but like the underlying quality is getting better, so there's that. And I would just say the AI, we have 21 different businesses working through AI right now. That are annual operating plan reviews and came out with an increased level of conviction that we're going to win relative to AI. We're just -- we're so -- our customer intimacy is really proven to be a competitive advantage, and we've got the tools and resources to get after the AI just as fast as anyone else. So we feel really good about that. And so buying ourselves in that scenario where there's this dislocation makes all the sense in the world, but it's also going to be an incredibly active year on M&A. So we're just really -- just got an abundance of opportunity in front of us this year.

Joseph Giordano
TD Cowen, Research Division

Now that you brought in this AI talent on the accelerator team, were there any instances where like negative instances where these guys coming in as experts kind of identified that maybe parts of your business where you thought you had more of an opportunity is going to be harder to drive? Or I mean, I'm sure they're identifying places that you have opportunities, but was there any unlike the negative side where something was like, well, maybe this isn't as attractive as I thought in a particular part of the company.

Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So I would say, on balance, their reviews and early takes are quite positive about the opportunity market-wise, technical-wise, the prowess of the teams that we have in place. But we also -- we had them sort of do a short readout to our Board last week. And then there was a few bullet points of things that were on the constructive ledger. None of it was market opportunity, lack of market opportunity or lack of opportunity to win.

Again, these are more technical resources, so they might not have like the best acumen in like these vertical market spaces to judge that anyway. But it was like, hey, as you'd expect, maybe there's -- we definitely need to improve the quantity of AI talent in the businesses. I mean that's a little bit of why we're adding the central team to sort of spark some acceleration. And it's just going to take some time because we've got to build these people. It's not something that we're going to be able to hire en masse. We got to build these people, and we did a good job last year. We'll continue to scale that and compound the learning on that this year.

Jason Conley
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think the ideas have been well received by Shane and Eddie. I mean they understand the specificity of what we're trying to solve at the individual sort of vertical level, and that's they view that as very unique, right, coming from a horizontal player. So I think they see the opportunity just like our businesses do.
