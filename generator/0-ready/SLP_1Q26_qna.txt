Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum.

Matthew Hewitt
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

Maybe first up, I was hoping we could get a little bit more color on some of the positive commentary you spoke to regarding most favored nations lower tariff risk, those types of things? And how that you see impacting budgets from your customers and whether or not you're anticipating a greater allocation of those R&D budgets towards modeling and simulation.

Shawn O'Connor
Chief Executive Officer

Sure, Matt. We just did our fourth quarter earnings call not that long ago, and we spoke to some of the events in the latter part of the calendar year '25 of agreements at some level in terms of most favored nation pricing and certainly, tariff talk as died down a bit. The U.K. agreement was put in place. So I think all of these things are starting to stabilize outlook for our clients, and we saw that begin to impact the discussions we had through the latter part of '25 as they were preparing budgets, so certainly a lot of activity and give us proposals, we want to put it in the budget for next year.

And so that was a very positive impact. As an update here in January, we saw a pretty robust activity turning those proposals into contracts for next year. And, in some cases, accelerated requirements in terms of getting some of that work done before the year-end that budget flush that happens every year in the industry. Certainly took place this year, and that translated into a pretty robust service revenue delivery for us in our November and ending quarter.

So certainly puts more wind in the sale in terms of optimism as we move into the calendar year of '26 that the constrained spending environment that we've operated in for the last number of years is starting to show some signs of opening up a bit. I'm Missourian and we'll believe it when I see it, but certainly, very optimistic given the activities of late.

Matthew Hewitt
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

That's very helpful. And then maybe just to dive into the software a little bit. It looks like GastroPlus was pretty good. ADMET predictor was pretty good, but it looks like more on the DILIsym QSP side, things might have been a little bit soft. Is there -- was that just kind of a one-off in the quarter? Or is it waiting for the FDA guidance that we just got here a couple of weeks ago. If you could just kind of provide a little more color on the puts and takes there.

Shawn O'Connor
Chief Executive Officer

Yes, certainly, certainly. The QSP models, if you recall, though, there is a recurring license, subscription license for the basic platform that many of our QSP models are accessed through. But the majority of QSP software licensing is the licensing of the therapeutic models, and our clients acquire those models on perpetual license basis. And we had an extremely good quarter a year ago, first quarter of last year and sold multiple therapeutic QSP models. And while we did have a closure here in this first quarter of this year, not the same level of activity on the QSP side in this quarter.

Maybe look at it on a year-to-year basis, we anticipate QSP therapeutic model licensing to grow. But on a quarter-to-quarter basis, we had a difficult comp compared back to the first quarter. So in general, QSP software revenue came in as expected. It's always a lumpy perpetual license flow of business there, but the interest is very high for those models high and QSP space altogether, both software and service support in that area, a very rapid growing area in terms of biosimulation altogether. But this quarter, in particular, on a year-over-year basis that QSP software license growth impacted by a bunch of models that were recognized last year.

Our next question is from Max Smock with William Blair.

Christine Rains
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

It's Christine Rains on for Max. So just diving on the services side in a little bit more, it's nice to see that business performed so strongly this quarter. But given the relative softness this quarter in software relative to your mix guide, I'm hoping you can give us some color on the expected mix cadence for software in the remaining 3 quarters? And what will catalyze the relative step-up in software performance.

Shawn O'Connor
Chief Executive Officer

Yes. No change in our guidance range in terms of software service mix. So the robust first quarter on the service side that brought its percentage of revenue up. That doesn't change our outlook for the year. Our guidance there is 57% to 62%. I think it is on a full year software contribution to our revenues. And our biggest software quarters are in third -- second and third quarter just from the seasonality of our renewals, the book of renewals that we have in those 2 middle quarters.

So great performance in the first quarter from the service organization, as I indicated in the prepared remarks, I think, as our clients turn to a little bit more accelerated spending, they've got a backlog of projects that they've been holding back on in terms of giving green light to that's more easily initiated on their part, software licensing, acquisition, increasing their staffing and modeling and simulation department with come as a lag to that or follow the ease of opening up the outside service line of their budgets. And so I don't anticipate any change in what we've guided to in terms of software service mix at this time.

Christine Rains
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Great. That makes sense. And then just one more on the software side for us. You discussed last quarter how the consolidation of large pharma was somewhat of a headwind to software renewals in the back half of fiscal 2025. So given what appears to be an improving M&A environment, did you see this headwind intensify in the first quarter. And then what is your typical impact from normal consolidation historically versus what's baked into your 2026 guide?

Shawn O'Connor
Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Consolidation is always an impactful contributor to that less than 100% renewal bankruptcies, the other component there in, and we certainly did see an uptick in some consolidation in the back half of our fiscal year '25. No major contribution in the first quarter in that regard. And certainly, as we've mapped out in terms of larger entity acquisitions. Typically, there's some visibility to announced acquisitions ahead of the renewal time frame and whatnot, so we get a little bit of forewarning, there's no forewarning of that in our renewal base for '26.

I think the uptick in the accelerated acquisition activity that we're starting to see in the industry is large pharma acquiring assets from smaller biotechs or the smaller biotechs are typically not large software licenses. And so while it is a headwinds and it can have an impact as we experienced in the back half of '25, the outlook doesn't show tremendous impact there, not in the first quarter results, nor in our expectations or guidance for the year.

Our next question comes from Scott Schoenhaus with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Scott Schoenhaus
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

So Shawn, I know you mentioned that the regulator guidance doesn't reflect any mix changes from the prior guidance. But it seems like the environment has improved and that there's a lot of momentum and backlog here. Does the cadence of your guidance change, should we expect less extreme back-weighted guidance here based on this sort of momentum and this improved environment.

Shawn O'Connor
Chief Executive Officer

Well, there is a little backloaded when you look at it from a percentage growth perspective, from an absolute dollar perspective, it's not quite so backload. What do I mean by that? I mean we're pretty open in looking at our '26 versus '25 revenue streams. And we knew that on the software side, proficiency platform revenue, software revenue contribution was at its peak in the first and second quarter of '25, and its run rate trend line came down in the back half of '25. And while it moves forward positively, our first half of the year, year-over-year software growth is going to be impacted by proficiency contribution at a little lower level.

The biosimulation software much, much better shape. You've got the dynamic that I just described in terms of the QSP perpetual license and they're having some impact, so on and so forth. So when we look at the software revenue flow on an absolute dollar basis, it kind of runs to the seasonality patterns of the past. But when you're looking at a year-over-year comp, given our profile of software revenue coming down in the back half of last year, 25 being at a higher level in the first half of the year, that overall year-over-year increase percentage is going to step up in the back half of the year as we get into a different comp situation.

Scott Schoenhaus
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

And then actually it's a great fall earlier to my follow-on. So I think in the prepared remarks, you guys have mentioned that MedCom's business was outperforming beyond expectations in the quarter. If that's right, should we assume that those proficiency comps that you just talked about should prove to be a little bit more conservative than your initial expectations 90 days ago.

Shawn O'Connor
Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Keep in mind, we're talking proficiency software platform licenses on the software side. Met Communication is the support we provide in commercialization service revenues. And yes, that came out of the shoots here better than anticipated, quite frankly, in the first quarter, and their backlog is looking good, and we look forward to their contribution in growth, but they will provide during the course of our fiscal year '26 here. That comp year-over-year challenges more dramatic and tackle on the proficiency software side.

Our next question is from Jeff Garro with Stephens.

Jeffrey Garro
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Yes. Shawn, earlier in the prepared remarks, I think I heard a comment that services should be a leading indicator for software demand. Maybe you could revisit on why that's been the case historically and how that rationale would apply to the current setup of the integrated product vision and the maybe larger portfolio of products than you've had historically?

Shawn O'Connor
Chief Executive Officer

Yes. I don't mean to imply that a clients will acquire service business prior to engaging in licensing. I mean, it goes both ways in terms of a new logo will start up -- could start up on either side of the business model. What I was referring to was the fact that as our clients work their way through their '25 -- calendar '25. And we're challenged to constrain their spending, cut back on their budgets. That didn't impact software as much as it affected outside services. That was the discretionary, if you will, budget line that they could hold back on, and we saw that impact our service business.

As clients turn more favorably to spend, their ability to turn on and initiate a project to sign the contract or give the green length of the performance of the contract that's been sitting there on hold is much quicker. And as they open up their budgets, often software upsells with existing clients occur as they expand the modeling departments. So that expansion that green length to go hire more modelers into their organization, obviously, takes a little bit more of a lead time in terms of their recruiting process and building their organizations. So the fact that service bookings activity is picking up quite nicely and what that may be that a leading indicator that the budget in totality is going to increase, and we'll see on the software acquisition side, some follow step-up in activity there to come.

Jeffrey Garro
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Excellent. I appreciate that. And maybe to switch gears a little bit to the profitability side of things. There was the comment around the reallocation of services personnel to product development. want to see if there's a specific impact to the P&L in the quarter to call out there? And just whether that's a temporary shift or something a little bit more permanent in nature related to the integrated product strategy. And I'll just tack on a follow-up. I know we'll get the cash flow statement in the 10-Q, but with R&D expense a little bit higher than we modeled. I want to see if there's anything to call out on capitalized software development expense.

Shawn O'Connor
Chief Executive Officer

Sure. Yes. I mean if I take you back in time, we undertook a reorganization of our organizational structure and the risk back in the third quarter fiscal year '25. And so the objective there was twofold. One, we rationalized our service resources to a lower level service revenue, and that has an impact on favorable margin in terms of excess staff that is no longer here. We also retained some of those valuable assets, people, scientists, and fully devoted them to our R&D effort, which was picking up with regard to the product vision that we were honing in on and beginning its implementation on.

So that increase in R&D spend comes from additional personnel there invested in accelerating our product activity, which we look forward to take the opportunity to advertise. We have an Investor Day meeting scheduled on January 21 to walk through and give some visibility in more detail as to what that unfolds with for the future.

And so yes, some increase in R&D expense. I'll let Will comment in terms of software capitalization and those sorts of things. I'd also before I hand it off, I point out that the R&D expense at a little bit higher percentage. Keep in mind that higher percentage were in our first quarter seasonality, the revenues are lower in the first and fourth quarter than second and third quarter. So the percentage increase of R&D spend in the first quarter will be averaged out over the course of the year as we work through our seasonal revenue quarters due to the end of the year. But Will, do you want to comment on capitalized software?

William Frederick
CFO, Executive VP & Corporate Secretary

Sure. I'll sort of step back as well, kind of revisit some of the items you mentioned, the reorg that we talked about, that was a reduction in services staff to look towards increasing utilization targets for billable personnel as well as reevaluating the work that folks did in the company on product development. So we've historically had last couple of years, services margins at around the 30%, and we're certainly looking, as we've messaged getting that closer to 30% to 35%. And that's due to the reorg as well as the reduction in force. The R&D expenses, certainly, we have continued to invest in that area.

So what you saw in first quarter, the 16% of revenue we do expect to see about a 15% to 17% R&D spend of revenue for the year. But we're still keeping our operating expense total around [ 50% ] of revenue for the year. So that's sales and marketing continuing to run at the 13% to 15% range. And then G&A is the one that will continue to come down as a percentage of revenue. On the capitalized software standpoint, that's running about the same. It's in the mid-20% of the work that's done is going into capitalized software and then that comes through as amortization expense on a quarterly basis.

Our next question is from David Larsen with BTIG.

David Larsen
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

On the services side, I think you mentioned that the commercialization efforts showed the growth there. Is that mainly proficiency? And just any more color around the strength there would be very helpful.

Shawn O'Connor
Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Just -- thanks, Dave, for the question. Yes, the proficiency acquisition in today's vernacular, brought us two revenue streams. One was the proficiency software platform, the training platform and clinical operations and the second revenue stream was medical communications and medical communications represents today 100% of our service revenues in the commercialization space. So yes, the medical communications in the commercialization market, it source was the proficiency acquisition.

David Larsen
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

So if I recall correctly, like a year ago, proficiency services revenue growth was under some pressure, and that was leading to some challenges. And correct me if I'm wrong, but I think what we're seeing here is kind of a recovery there and maybe a little bit of an easier comp.

Shawn O'Connor
Chief Executive Officer

Yes. The commercialization, the Med Communication service revenues like most all of our services was under pressure in the back half of our fiscal year '25 as budgets pulled back. And so the delivery in terms of MedCom in the first quarter was a bit above our expectations and very reflective of more active spend on our clients in that space and its outlook is pretty positive for fiscal year 2026.

David Larsen
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just one more quick one for me. On the software side, I think I saw clinical operations software down. I thought it was like 80% or something like that, which led to the overall decline in software year-over-year. So it looks like it's like is that one product line? Which product line was that? And is there a reason why it was unusual. Did a deal push or something like that?

Shawn O'Connor
Chief Executive Officer

Yes. The clinical operations software is our proficiency training platform. And so upon acquisition, its contribution in its first and second quarter of fiscal '25 was pretty strong. We saw that come down in the back half of the year, driven by clinical trial start-up challenges and the like. And so here in the first quarter, while they delivered pretty much to expectation, the year-over-year comp is negative, but in line with our expectation at this point in terms of fiscal year '26.

David Larsen
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And just -- I'm sorry, one more quick one. 88% fee retention. Is that in line with your expectations? And then I'll hop back in the queue.

Shawn O'Connor
Chief Executive Officer

Yes. It's been at that level over the last several quarters. Historically, 90% plus is where it's at. We did have a couple of renewals that didn't get signed over Thanksgiving weekend and got signed in the first week of December, that impacted that number a bit. So I think the renewal rate was relatively good, especially if you think of it in terms of those couple of deals that slipped into the beginning of the fourth quarter.

Our next question is from Brendan Smith with TD Cowen.

Brendan Smith
TD Cowen, Research Division

I wanted to actually first ask about this ongoing AI integration with the core platform and how the initial rollout is going? Anything of note you're hearing from customers? And maybe just how we should think about that as it pertains to license renewals and maybe pricing flexibility within those renewals over the coming months.

Shawn O'Connor
Chief Executive Officer

Yes. The initial release of some of the new AI features went out with the GastroPlus release late last fiscal year, response has been favorable, very favorable to it with the -- what more can you do as some clients have gotten visibility to our road map and what that it's monetization comes along the way in several forms and shapes. We were a bit more aggressive this year in terms of our price increase, with some of that AI technology being embedded in the base model, if you will.

And there will be opportunities to monetize it modules and other new products into the future. I look forward to walking through that in a couple of weeks at our Investor Day. But it certainly is immediately contributing as we bring it out across our product line in terms of an ability to be a bit more aggressive in terms of pricing.

Brendan Smith
TD Cowen, Research Division

Got it. That's super helpful. And maybe just related to that, and this might be more a question for the Investor Day in a couple of weeks. But are there plans to launch any new verticals or products within the existing platform over the next, say, 12 to 18 months? Or should we really see this year as a time to land and expand within the existing franchises you have on hand now.

Shawn O'Connor
Chief Executive Officer

There's no desire, if other verticals take us outside of our supportive drug development now. We do support work effort in the chemical space, agrobusiness, cosmetics, some business there. But certainly, our focus is primarily in drug development discovery clinical development, commercialization, clinical ops. And our baseline engines GastroPlus, Monolix, QSP capabilities, et cetera, are the engines that drive there are -- there's ability to create new revenue streams with the product ecosystem that we're working to deliver to the marketplace.

And yes, we -- we'll walk through that in a little bit more detail at the Investor Day. I wouldn't anticipate that their delivery and translation into revenue flow I guess the way to put it is that it's not anticipated to be significantly impactful to our '26 revenue and/or is embedded in our guidance already.

Operator

There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the floor back over to Shawn O'Connor for any closing remarks.

Shawn O'Connor
Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Thanks, everyone. We look forward to sharing more about the strategy we've been talking about and referring to our product road map. The next phase of our evolution is at our Virtual Investor Day on January 21. We're excited to give you a deeper look at how our ecosystem comes together and how it will create value for our clients investors and patients will go. You can register on the Investor Relations section of our website.

And if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to Lisa Financial Profiles who can assist with any questions you might have there. But otherwise, I appreciate your attention, and look forward to seeing you later in the month. Take care, everyone.
