[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Wells Fargo.

Shahriar Pourreza
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So obviously, the upside slide, it seems fairly material around incremental data center opportunities. Are the data center deals kind of -- are they an inflection point to rebase higher or shift that 6% to 8% CAGR?

Or should we still kind of assume lengthen and strengthen? I guess, what do you need to see to revisit that guided trajectory, especially since some of it can hit the back end of the plan and you're already growing at the higher end?

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

Thanks for the question. Yes, we're really excited about the first 1.4 gigawatt deal we have on the table, and we feel well positioned to execute on that. We're continuing conversations. As I mentioned in the intro, we've got 4 gigawatts -- well, 3 to 4 gigawatts that we're continuing to work with hyperscalers with a total pipeline of roughly 7. That said, as we are advancing these negotiations, our intent would be to find terms that we can then -- and the ramp that we can then incorporate into our next year's IRP and then determine the generating resource to support that load.

It could be a large generating load or a combination of batteries and renewables. But the intent would be to get it into the 5-year plan, if at all possible, and that would give us growth opportunities above and beyond where we are today. So we feel really good about the deal we have on the table and our ability to execute on it.

Shahriar Pourreza
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Got it. But just -- I guess, just to -- is it accretive to the 6% to 8%, I guess, how do we sort of think about how you currently guide?

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think that is a fair assumption that it would be upside to our current 6% to 8%.

Shahriar Pourreza
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Perfect. And then just -- and obviously, you noted a more conservative outlook for Vantage due to commodity pricing. But I guess what are you seeing on the energy service side? And does it make sense to monetize certain assets, especially with the inflection of equity needs starting in '26?

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We're continuing our focus on our energy service business line and Vantage. We're working on behind-the-meter project, in fact, outside of the state of Michigan for our data center, and that could be an additional vertical that we pursue.

But Vantage has been a really great part of our portfolio for over 20 years with a really strong BD pipeline and opportunities for really good returns. So -- but as always, we look for ways to optimize value for shareholders. We don't have anything imminent right now, but it's something that we'll continue to examine.

Shahriar Pourreza
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Perfect. And big congrats, Joi, on your first earnings call. I know Jerry is listening. He's proud and just keep that dividend growing for him now that he's on a fixed income. Appreciate it, guys.

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Shar.

And your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.

Aidan Kelly
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

This is actually Aidan Kelly on for Jeremy. Yes. So just regarding the EPS CAGR, is the right math to think about like 2026 high end and then growing 8% off that until 2030? Or should we think about the EPS CAGR kind of being based off the midpoint each year?

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

So midpoint this year is the way we guide. And the 45Zs give us the potential to hit the top end of our range. And as you know, those 45Zs extend through 2029.

Aidan Kelly
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the incremental load, maybe just like how much should we think about like the load is needed to trigger a new gas plant versus just more energy storage at this point? I mean like when you look at the 7 gigawatt pipeline, how should we think about like what's needed for new base load versus just like incremental storage?

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So think of it this way, any new data center load that we bring on after this 1.4 gigawatts will require additional resources. If we bring on something in the gigawatt range, it would require a combined cycle to support it. Anything lower than that, we could do a combination of either smaller CCGT and some renewables and batteries. But we'll know all of that for certain once we sign the deal and incorporate it into next year's IRP. And that will really dictate the resource requirements and the resource mix.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Congratulations again, Joi, and to the whole team here. Nicely done here, I got to say, and nicely done on firming up this contract here, as you say. Now with that said, and just to follow up on some of the last questions here, how do you think about the data center timing here? You talk about it being accretive to the plan.

How do you think about the time line for its ramp? I know that you already cautioned that it wasn't entirely clear cut. But how do you think about it being accretive versus perhaps serial and an extension of the 6 to 8. We don't mean to nitpick too much here, but I think we heard your comments earlier, and I just wanted to come back and understand when that would really start to kick in and be accretive.

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

Yes. You can think of it toward the tail end, given just the lead times on some of the materials and the construction cycle, Julien, you could think of it towards the back end of our plan. So call it, late 2029 into the early 2030s.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Got it. So that uptick would potentially be probably that first year really would be that 2030 time frame. And then the question would be how sustained that elevated growth rate would be predicated on the success of the 3 gigawatts in late-stage negotiations?

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And again, I'll repeat, we're going to take all of this and incorporate it into next year's IRP. And really, that will dictate not only the timing, but the right resource mix, which will then drive timing of construction, lead times for materials and such.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Right. Indeed, your owned versus a contracted piece, et cetera, et cetera.

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

Exactly.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I appreciate it. Good luck and congrats, again.

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Julien.

Your next question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.

David Arcaro
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I was wondering just on the advanced stage data center pipeline. Is there any rough timing for when you'd expect the potential to finalize those deals and bring them forward or advance other projects maybe into the -- from the earlier stage pipeline into the advanced stage pipeline? What's the pace of crystallization of some of the projects?

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks for the question. So we're in active negotiations, and we have been for some time. We are still settling on some key terms and ramp rates. I would envision that we would have at least an idea of the ramp and firming up some of the terms before we file next year's IRP. We're pulling that forward.

That's the idea into the third quarter. So we would want to be able to understand the ramp, understand exactly when that ramp would lay out over a 5-year plan and incorporate it into our modeling, so we can put it into the IRP.

David Arcaro
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. Perfect. Yes, that's helpful. And then you piqued my interest with the behind-the-meter project that you're working on for Vantage for a data center. I was just wondering if you might be able to elaborate on maybe how big of a project that might be, what kind of power generation technology you're using? Any thoughts on maybe how returns stack up for that type of a project versus others in the Vantage pipeline? Yes, curious about that overall opportunity.

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We're still in discussions with the data center provider. It's primary power. So it's behind the meter. You can think of that as more like [ CTs ]. And again, it's a little too early for us to give a lot of details around this deal. We haven't fully closed it yet, but it's a really good opportunity for the Vantage team and it's right down the fairway if you look at our skill set as an enterprise.

So this is just a really good example of the type of projects Vantage has in the pipeline that supports their income targets, and we'll look for additional opportunities like that should they become available. We'll keep you posted, though, as things develop.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Appicelli with UBS.

William Appicelli
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Just a question around the rate case in the IRM. I guess what is the potential upside for investment there should more supportive regulation and decisions come your way around -- in terms of just the capital outlook on that mechanism?

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So just to give clarity, the IRM -- the investments are already in our plan. What we did hear back from the staff was strong support for the investment profile that we laid out in the case and the pace. So the -- our intent, though, is to continue to grow the IRM in future cases. So in this case, we requested up to $1 billion beginning in 2027.

And what -- we were really happy to hear the staff support even a pull forward. So they did pull out maybe $200 million of the pole top maintenance and suggested that, that should get incorporated into our existing IRM in 2026. So that would be incremental IRM spend that would show up next year should we get that final ruling in 2026 in February. So again, it just showcases that we're aligned with the staff on the type of investments we need to make to improve reliability and the pace.

William Appicelli
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then just taking a step back, I mean, when we think about the broader growth rate through 2030, just to be clear, when you guys say bias to the upper end, that's with the plan as it stands here today? Or would that need to require some additional capital to push you to the upper end? Or I just want to clarify that. Or would that be then, to the points made earlier, upside to the plan overall?

David Ruud
Vice Chairman & CFO

That 6% to 8% through 2030 is our plan that we've laid out here today. And we say we have a bias to the upper end in each year, again, in that plan due to the 45Z tax credits and the flexibility that they provide. Joi talked about the additional opportunities we have with additional data centers that would drive some additional upside to that plan.

William Appicelli
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. So then when we talk about the through 2030, which is post the tax credits, when you talk about the bias to the upper end extending out that far, that reflects just the capital plan as it stands today?

David Ruud
Vice Chairman & CFO

Yes. Yes. We see -- when we get to 2030, because of the 45Zs also, you have flexibility year-to-year. So we think there's opportunity in 2030 to hit the upper end that year 2 of the 6% to 8% range.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research.

Michael Sullivan
Wolfe Research, LLC

I just wanted to pick right up on that last question, Dave. So in 2030, when the 45Zs go away, what is it that pushes you to the high end? Or is there like some way you can continue to book those a year beyond the expiration? Or just a little more color on that would be helpful.

David Ruud
Vice Chairman & CFO

Yes. What we see with these 45Zs is flexibility, right? So we've been able to -- as we've done this year is find ways to pull forward some expenses to help future years. And we just see that favorability from 2029, helping us in 2030 as well to be able to be in a good position to reach the higher end when we get out there, too.

Michael Sullivan
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. That's really helpful. And then another one for you, Dave. I think in the past, you may have all pointed to more of like a 15% to 16% FFO to debt range and looks like now just 15%. Any color on what's going on there?

David Ruud
Vice Chairman & CFO

Well, I'll just say, Mike, we have got great growth opportunity in our utility as we're doing this work that Joi described for reliability and cleaner generation also at the data center. So we're comfortable targeting this 15% range continues to give us the right cushion over the thresholds that we think.

And it puts us in a really good place, remain committed to having a good balance sheet. And we're working with the rating agencies to ensure they fully understand our financing plan, really our strong cash flows, too, and they'll be comfortable with it going forward.

Michael Sullivan
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And one last quick one. Just the $2.5 billion for CCGT investment, I think you're building a 1.5 gigawatt plant. Is that the full amount? Or are you not capturing the full investment in the 5 year and the plant itself could cost a little more than that? Because that just seems a little on the lower end, I would have thought of what a combined cycle would cost.

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It trails into '31, so beyond the 5 year.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank.

Andrew Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Dave, a question for you first. You mentioned that at gas, you're unwinding some cost-cutting efforts from the past few years. I know that as a company, you're masterful about being nimble with O&M expenses, but I thought that was typically more short term, like within a year, maybe 2. So I'm a little surprised to hear you talk about it over a multiyear period. Can you discuss some examples of what might be included in there? What type of actions you're referring to? And then as we look to '26 and beyond, how should we think about the O&M outlook for the gas business?

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We've essentially let some of the backlogs, maintenance backlogs, we allowed those to rise, and we're unwinding a lot of that this year. So that's just an example of some of the things that we typically do in the gas company. And we were ahead of plan when -- before we saw warmer weather. So we had some opportunities to relax our maintenance efforts, and this is nonemergent maintenance backlog. And this year, we're just getting back on track. We're getting back to our normal run rate for maintenance and other expenses.

David Ruud
Vice Chairman & CFO

And Andrew, I'll say like on our ability to be nimble, like we had a couple of years of warmer weather at gas. And so that did extend over a couple of years, but it still shows that we're able to balance things across our business to make sure we do everything to hit the numbers.

Andrew Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. Great. And that is part of the outlook?

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

The outlook for gas?

Andrew Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

As we think about O&M -- yes, the outlook for O&M at gas going forward?

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

Yes. The O&M for gas. This is -- I think this is a normal run rate that we would typically see. And then as usual, we build in some flexibility where we can lean if we need to or invest, should we see colder than normal temperatures.

Andrew Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then, Joi, in your prepared remarks, I want to ask about affordability a bit. I think you said the 1.4 gigawatts of new data center load should bring meaningful affordability benefits to the existing customers. But then you also talked about protecting them.

So I'm just wondering, can you give more specific -- are you expecting the new data centers and this specific deal to be neutral to residential customer rates or monthly bills or deflationary? And how will that impact flow through? Will that go through rate cases or through the industrial tariff? How is that going to work for existing customers?

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

Yes. This is great for existing customers because we don't have to build anything substantial to support the load. We're using our excess capacity to support the load and building batteries on top of it just for peak shaving purposes. And the customers get that full benefit. So it will show up in the form of a lower ask over our next rate case cycle. So customers will get that flow through in that form. In terms of the protections, the contract terms protect our customers from stranded assets or rate shock over a period of time when we're serving the customers, the data center customers that is.

Andrew Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Congrats.

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho.

Anthony Crowdell
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Hope all is well. I just wanted to follow up 2 quick cleanups. One to Mike's question earlier on the FFO to debt, Dave. As Vantage becomes a smaller and smaller portion of the company's earnings mix, any conversation with the agencies of an improved or a lower downgrade threshold?

David Ruud
Vice Chairman & CFO

We are in constant communication with the rating agencies. I think right now -- and because we have a lot of really utility-like projects at Vantage, I don't know if that will lead to lower thresholds, but we will continue those conversations because we will be moving more into that going forward as well.

Anthony Crowdell
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

And the current threshold is 14% or 15%?

David Ruud
Vice Chairman & CFO

It's down around 14%. It depends -- the rating agency depends on the way they measure it also relative to how we do, but more in the 13% to 14%.

Anthony Crowdell
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Great. And then one of the earlier questions, I think Bill was asking on the IRM mechanism. You highlighted, I think, staff is $1.2 billion. I guess, just the cadence of spend, if you could just talk about that? And then also, the company previously or historically would file maybe an electric case every maybe 12 to 24 months. Does that stretch out the filings, the frequency of the filings?

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So the way -- the IRM is $1 billion. It starts in 2027. We have an existing IRM, but it starts to ramp up in our filing in 2027 and grows to $1 billion over 3 years. And the way that we've laid this out, we would start to see that investment grow and make adjustments along the way based on performance.

So in our next filing, we will look to update it and increase it even further. You asked about will that keep us out of rate cases. Where we have it right now, it would give us maybe 6 to 8 months worth of, I think, benefit that we could push out a rate case for that period of time. As it continues to grow, that time will lengthen.

Anthony Crowdell
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Great. Joi, such an improvement versus Jerry. Great move.

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Anthony.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Ladenburg.

Paul Fremont
Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division

I guess my first question is the junior subordinated debt that you talked about, is that instead of or in addition to the planned equity -- annual issuance of equity?

David Ruud
Vice Chairman & CFO

Yes. We do expect to have some junior sub that comes within our plan. We're going to look at that strategically, but that would be additional to the equity that is laid out. What we've laid out is what we would need to do for true equity issuances of $500 million to $600 million.

Paul Fremont
Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division

Great. And then on the CCGT, what is the cost per kW that we should assume for the CCGT?

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

Well, we're seeing ranges. So right now, it's roughly $2,500, and we're still updating our estimates. We'll know for certain once we get the finalization of our RFPs and see what is coming out. We've got the IRPs for our power island, but there's still some additional work. But that's our initial estimate at this point.

Paul Fremont
Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division

Great. And then turbine availability, if you get the 3 gigawatts that you're in advanced stage negotiation, do you see -- what time frame do you see sort of being able to get turbines?

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Well, we're actually in the queue for our turbines that we want to bring on to replace Monroe only. And that CCGT we have in the plan, it only supports the retirement of Monroe, has nothing to do with data centers. If we want to bring on another CCGT to support data centers, we're still seeing a 3- to 4-year time line for at least 1 gigawatt and above.

There is some flexibility we're seeing for smaller turbines. It just depends on how big of a data center load we're trying to serve and when the ramp kind of gets to the top end. So we'll flesh all of this out in next year's IRP and again, pick the right resource mix to support the load.

Paul Fremont
Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division

So I guess, just theoretically, if some of the 3 gigawatts were to be finalized, if their need were sort of before that 3- to 4-year time line, you would serve that load potentially through purchase power? Or how would that work?

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

Yes. The way that we're going to address these contracts is really get a sense of how quickly they want to ramp and then use the IRP modeling to tell us what is the optimal resource mix to support that load.

It could be a combination of renewables and battery storage, similar to what we're doing with this -- the deal that we have on the table or it could require a CCGT. Still too early to say. All of that will get fleshed out as we finalize the negotiations and incorporate it into the IRP next year.

Paul Fremont
Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division

Great. And then last question for me. You're looking at potentially higher trading contributions in '25. Can you give us a sense of how much? And will next year's trading contribution be sort of back at the 50 to 60 level that it was this year?

David Ruud
Vice Chairman & CFO

Right, Paul. Trading is having a really good year. We're seeing these strong margins. We talked about both gas and physical power portfolio, again, structured and hedged. Right now, our year-to-date is above the range, and that's given us some flexibility across our business.

We don't plan for earnings to continue at that pace. We put in the $50 million to $60 million, as you mentioned. However, because some of these contracts are longer term, we do see some favorability that could come into '26, but we don't forecast that long term. We forecast around the 50 to 60 still.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport.

Agnieszka Storozynski
Seaport Research Partners

So lots of questions ahead of me. But can you give me a sense the 1.5 gig or the current data center contract that you just finalized 1.4 and then the additional contracts in the works, I mean, how do they compare versus the load that you currently serve? Yes, like a percentage-wise, how big of an impact is it?

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So the 1.4 increases our load by 25%. So that should give you a sense of what an additional gigawatt could equate to if we were able to bring it on.

Agnieszka Storozynski
Seaport Research Partners

Yes. I mean, yes, that puts it in perspective. Now on Vantage, I understand that you're shifting investments towards basically a higher multiple business, which makes sense.

But I would -- it's kind of surprising to see that there is less of growth opportunities for Vantage in this day and age where you have this seemingly an explosion of behind-the-meter generation, like cogen seems to be such a hot investment right now. Is omni because it's behind the meter, is omni because it's time to power. So again, you did mention some commodity price pressures, but I'm a little bit surprised to see this lower growth CAGR for that business.

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Angie, we're going to continue to work the BD pipeline there. And this first deal that we're getting -- at least trying to get under our belt would inform if this is a vertical that we can pursue further. And again, this is outside of the state of Michigan. We're hearing more and more that this behind-the-meter option is something that data center providers want to pursue.

And so to your point, we're going to keep working it and ensure that we've got the execution capability. We've settled on a design we think that works, that gives the redundancy. So we think that could position us to be really attractive to data centers that are looking to pursue this type of solution.

Agnieszka Storozynski
Seaport Research Partners

Okay. And Dave, could you comment on growth expectations for your dividend in this new higher CapEx environment?

David Ruud
Vice Chairman & CFO

Yes, Angie, we're going to continue to revisit the dividend growth. We said in our prepared remarks, we're going to grow them with our operating EPS. And right now, we're in a payout ratio that's right in the midpoint of our peers. But we're going to continue to look at that and make sure that it supports both growth and what our investors prefer here.

Agnieszka Storozynski
Seaport Research Partners

Very good. Congrats.

David Ruud
Vice Chairman & CFO

Thank you.

Your last question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar.

Travis Miller
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Just want to confirm the cash flow and earnings mix here over the next couple of years. So do you hear it correctly, the ramp comes for this data center, the ramp comes next year. And then there's really no incremental capital that you would fund because they're funding the storage, right? So cash flow and earnings should be pretty close at least over the next 1 to 2 years as this data center contract ramps up. Is that correct?

David Ruud
Vice Chairman & CFO

Well, we're investing the storage -- to fund the storage assets. And then we'll be getting the cash flows from the ramp, which does ramp up really quick. But we will be investing in those storage assets. And that's why -- one of the reasons why we're pulling some of our capital forward and need some of this additional equity.

Travis Miller
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Okay. Okay. And that would be over a short period of time though, right?

David Ruud
Vice Chairman & CFO

Yes, short periods, very much.

Travis Miller
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Okay. And what size is the storage investment? Not dollars, but how many gigawatts or megawatts?

Joi Harris
President, CEO & Director

It's a gigawatt of storage, and then we're going to use tolling agreements. So in accordance with our IRP settlements, we are going to build 2/3 of the requirement, and then we're going to use tolling agreements for the other 1/3, which are -- we'll get the FCM on the tolling agreements.
