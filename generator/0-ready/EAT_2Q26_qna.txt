Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.

Dennis Geiger
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Congrats on the strong results. First, I just wanted to ask a little bit more on contributors to the strong traffic and sales growth in the quarter. You gave a lot of color. Beyond the Margarita campaign, just curious if any other notable shifts in contributors as we think about 3 For Me and where that was mixing, Triple Dipper mix, et cetera. Anything to call out there?

Mika Ware
Executive VP & CFO

You know, I'll start, Kevin -- go ahead.

Kevin Hochman
President, CEO & Director

Go ahead, Mika. Sorry, we're in different locations because of the ice storm. But go ahead, Mika.

Mika Ware
Executive VP & CFO

I'll start with some of the things, and Kevin, you can fill in some color. So as we've talked and we've guided all year, our pricing has been very stable kind of right in the middle of that 3% to 5% range. What I will say on mix is, yes, we were very, very happy with the performance of the Margarita of the Month. But overall, our mix was still positive. That was driven not only by the margaritas, but continued success in Triple Dippers.

They were up still year-over-year, even lapping the big numbers from prior year and some appetizer sales with the new Quesos out. So we're not seeing any huge changes. We're still really happy with how our menu is performing, how our sales are going. And again, our traffic, we were very pleased with the traffic. Throughout the quarter, we had positive traffic that before the storm was continuing on. So nothing huge, Dennis, that changed. Kevin, if you want to add in some color to that.

Kevin Hochman
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I was going to say the same thing with a little bit different angle. It's just more of the same. So we continue to streamline the menu. We continue to improve operations and make the needed investments to improve the overall guest experience. And then we see that in the internal metrics, and then that allows us to both attract new guests with things like the 3 For Me and the Margarita of the Month program that we did really well in November and December, but then also allow us to retain existing guests. So we don't see any frequency changes.

So we don't see frequency changes in existing guests, and we keep bringing new guests in and they start looking like existing guests pretty quickly in terms of frequency, that's how you sustainably grow over time. So like I shared the GWAP metric, guests with a problem continue to hit record lows. Our food grade scores went from 68% last year in Q2 to 74% this year. We also saw quarter-on-quarter improvements in food grade and same thing with intent to return was 72% last year, it's almost 78% this year. So you just look across the board, the internal metrics continue to get better.

And this is why I keep saying as long as we keep focusing on the fundamentals of casual dining, and we are honestly looking in the mirror saying, are we going to be better this year than last year, and we continue to have this world-class marketing, there's no reason why the comp won't continue to grow. So we're just going to -- it's going to be kind of a boring quarter when we say there are new drivers, and it's like, well, they're not new drivers, but there are new things we're doing to drive those drivers. And I couldn't be more proud of the team.

Dennis Geiger
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Great. Appreciate it, guys. And just one more. You guys both gave good color on sort of back half of the year revenue and comp expectations. And I think talked about a strong quarter-to-date even with a calendar shift pressure, I believe. Anything else on kind of the back half of the year as it relates to top line expectations? Anything embedded from a stimulus tax rebate perspective? Or Kevin, anything else to share on some of those big levers, which sound exciting for the back half of the year?

Mika Ware
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Dennis, so let me kind of talk about that. So we, like Kevin said, expect more of the same. So we're forecasting for Chili's solid mid-single-digit comps for the back half of the year. We've talked about pricing. I think, again, mix may moderate a little bit in the back half of the year just as we continue to lap those really big Triple Dipper numbers.

And then traffic, what I would say is prior to the storm, we would have expected traffic positive in both Q3 and Q4. We may have a little pressure with the storm and the holiday flip on traffic just because of those 2 events. It could be flat to slightly negative traffic in Q3, but we expect positive traffic in Q4. So really, it's more of the same, but that's some of the detailed color into what we expect the same-store sales to do over time.

Your next question is from Chris O'Cull with Stifel.

Christopher O'Cull
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Mika, I just want to follow up on that last question. Can you just maybe elaborate on, or level set us on the comp cadence that's embedded into the back half of the year guidance?

Mika Ware
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. No, it's going to be pretty steady as we go. So January will have the storm and the holiday flip. But after that, I expect it to be very steady mid-single digits. There's not a lot of flips in and out, and the quarters will be very similar to each other is what we expect.

Christopher O'Cull
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Perfect. And then, Kevin, you guys have successfully used the $10.99 anchor to drive the 43% 2-year comp. But the barbell strategy relies on guests eventually, I would think, trading up to premium items like the Triple Dipper and then maybe the new ribs. But as you lap these massive traffic gains, how do you prevent the $10.99 price point from becoming a structural ceiling on the pricing power? Is there any long-term risk that you're training your most loyal new guests or your new guest, I guess, to never leave that price point?

Kevin Hochman
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Well, it's something we've talked about for several years now. It's very important for our team to have offerings for all guests because if too much mix gets into the $10.99 price point, obviously, the math doesn't continue the math. So one of the first thing that we do is we have what we call the barbell strategy, which we've talked about, which is we have good, better, best price tiers because not every guest wants the cheapest thing on the menu, some want different benefits or different features and the things that they buy.

So like when we launch the chicken sandwich, the relaunch of the chicken sandwich, it's not just going to be a hot opening price point that we advertise on TV. We're going to have chicken sandwich with benefits. We're going to have more premium chicken sandwiches that can take you all the way up to the highest tiers, and then we're going to continue to manage that. So the outcome when you do this is that you keep the $10.99 sales mix constant.

You don't let it grow too much because that's when the margins can get out of whack. So as long as we continue to bring innovation, not just at the $10.99 price point, but at other price points that we keep other parts of the menu interesting and we hold the mix on all those parts of the menu, we shouldn't have any issue continuing to advertise $10.99. Now 5 years from now, I know we might be in a different position. It's hard to predict how -- what will happen with COGS inflation, et cetera.

But because we have such a varied menu and we've done a really good job merchandising and we continue to innovate on higher tiers like ribs and margaritas, et cetera, we're continuing to drive people into that mix. We don't see -- we don't have like specifics of detail. We don't see, in general, a lot of trading up and down the menu. So people kind of gravitate to what they want to gravitate to, and they stick with it.

So like the 3 For Me consumer tends to come more often. They actually spend more over the course of the year because they come more often versus higher-priced guests. They don't come as often, but they're worth a lot to us because they spend more when they're there. So -- but like -- I get asked a lot of questions about our people bounce all over the menu, and you just don't see that much of that.

Christopher O'Cull
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Makes sense. Congrats on the great quarter, guys.

Your next question for today is from David Palmer with Evercore ISI.

David Palmer
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I had a question on the reimaging. Is there any one of the prototypes that you're testing that is emerging as the most exciting, perhaps the one that you feel like has a very good odds of being the go-to-market option that can be rolled out quickly and with significant sales lifts? And if so, what can you tell us about the learnings from the reimaging?

Kevin Hochman
President, CEO & Director

David, thanks for the question. So there's 2 reasons why we're doing these first 4. One is to understand the levels of investment and which ones make the most sense. And then the second is to get operational learnings so that we don't make -- if there's any mistakes in the first, we don't make them as we roll them out to the balance of the system. And obviously, we'll continue to learn beyond just these first 4.

The first thing I would tell you is the guests, and the team members absolutely love all 4 of the reimage units. And there's a lot of clarity in our system to get that across the system. So that's good. It's too early to declare victory on sales lifts. The initial results look pretty good. We're pretty excited about that. But it's nothing that we would publish and that you could take to the bank. Obviously, we want to understand more and look at test versus control and all that good stuff.

So overall, the first thing is they look like completely different restaurants. And when all of you guys are here for our Investor Day later in the year, you'll be able to tour them. So we'll make sure we spend time where you can see them firsthand, those first 4 and get your eyes on them and see that's a marked difference. I mean basically, the comment I typically hear from the managers is like we have a new restaurant, which is really cool to hear because these are really old restaurants that haven't been touched a while.

The second thing that we've learned is that -- so each of the 4 have different elements to them. And the good news is the one that has actually the lowest cost is the one that everybody is gravitating towards is the best. So some of the ones that cost a little bit more, they had a little too much done on the inside and they're a little too busy. So we're learning like, hey, less is more in some of the interior units. But things like the bar part of the reimage has been phenomenal.

I mean it literally just makes the whole building feel different, not just the bar area that creates an energy and a vibe. And it is distinctly Chili's. I mean you go in and you're like, wow, it feels like I'm back in Chili's when it first started, but in a modern way. So that's the second thing we're learning is that we probably don't need all the bells and whistles. Like, for example, a couple of the restaurants have these oversized margarita shakers that we actually pulled from the old, old Chili's.

And it's something that just feels like it's clutter, it's not really adding versus some of the tile tables that we've added and some of the cheaper frills actually make a bigger impact. So we're going to be obviously focused on the things that make the biggest impact for the lowest cost. So that's a good learning. And then lastly, we're learning a lot about the operational opportunities with rolling them out. So for example, we're learning there's just a lot of extra dust and a lot of extra work that's coming in that construction.

So we got to do a better job of like masking and taping and tarping, and those are important things to know as we roll out further. We're learning about some of the tile work that we're putting by the bar is actually not needed and it adds additional expense that's not needed. So just using the tiles on the tabletops, on the exterior and on the size of the bar, but not the floor of the bar is making the maximum impact. And then we're also learning about some of the operational opportunities.

So like, for example, we're bringing back tile tables, but we're doing it in a smart way where they're much easier to clean. So like the old tile tables that were so cool are really difficult to clean the grout in between the tiles. And so we're basically doing is a printed tile table that looks 3-dimensional but then has an acrylic top on top of it. We're finding that those are a little hard to clean, not the tile, but because that's printed unit, but the actual plastic is starting to buckle under the heat of skillets.

So that's an example where we're just going to spend a little bit more time getting the right tabletop on that. So that's what we're learning from it. It's both operationally, how do we make sure it is sound. And then two, what is the right investments. But I will tell you, we are extremely bullish about this, and we can't wait for you guys to see what we've done.

Your next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.

John Ivankoe
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

It's actually a follow-up on the previous question. In terms of the remodels, which obviously you're planning to accelerate into '27, I think you said 60 to 80 but correct me on that. With potential further acceleration into...

Mika Ware
Executive VP & CFO

John, you're cutting out.

Operator

Looks like his line dropped. We'll take our next question from Jeff Farmer.

Jeffrey Farmer
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Just cutting through the weather and all the calendar shifts that the industry is facing, what is your read on casual dining segment trends in December and January? So ultimately, I'm trying to ask you guys if you think the demand backdrop is stable? Is it softening? Is it improving? Any color there would be helpful.

Kevin Hochman
President, CEO & Director

Well, it's just like what you guys are seeing, it's mixed, right? Like December was tougher for the industry, but then January looked really good and then the weather hit, which kind of stopped that trend. So -- I mean, candidly, it's a lot of mixed signals. What I've told our team is just continuing to focus on the things that we can control, which is food service and atmosphere, whether the economy gets better and the consumer gets better or worse, having a better experience is going to win trips, which is what's happened in the last couple of years for our business.

So if the macro gets better, that will be more tailwind for us. If the macro doesn't get better, we're going to continue to steal market share from those that aren't improving their food service and atmosphere. So -- but to answer your question directly, December didn't look great. January looked better. Weather stopped everything. We'll see what happens when we get out of -- fully out of the weather, whether the strength that we saw in January restarts. So -- but it's similar to what you're seeing.

Jeffrey Farmer
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Okay. And then, Mika, with the updated guidance, can you just sort of level set us on the restaurant level margin and G&A as a percent of revenue expectation for fiscal '26?

Mika Ware
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. So looking out into the back half of the year, what I would say is our restaurant level margin will probably decrease a little bit in the back half versus what we posted in P2 (sic) [ Q2 ] . And really, it's the line I think everyone should look at is make sure the cost of sales line is going to be pretty similar to what you saw in Q2, maybe a little bit higher. I talked about the kind of influx in commodity pricing in the back half.

That also -- that mid-single digit includes some of those investments we've made in things like bacon and ribs and some better cut chicken. But with that being said, they're going to be phenomenal margins in the back half, very steady, similar to what you saw in Q, maybe just a little bit less as some -- as we kind of wash through some of those lap's year-over-year.

Jeffrey Farmer
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

And then G&A real quick?

Mika Ware
Executive VP & CFO

G&A is going to be very similar to what you saw. We are 4.1% of total revenues in Q2. I expect similar numbers as you move through the fiscal year. Very similar to what you saw in Q2.

Your next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.

John Ivankoe
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Can you hear me?

Mika Ware
Executive VP & CFO

We can now.

John Ivankoe
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

All right. Super. You are talking about travel disruptions. I'm doing this from the airport, ask this big, long question and I was literally just talking to myself. So thank you for the patience on this. So the question is actually a follow-up to the remodel question. Obviously, remodel is an important part of the Chili's business. And I think I heard you say, and correct me if I'm wrong, that you're planning 60 to 80 remodels in '27 with a further...

Operator

Looks like we dropped his line again. We'll move on to John Tower with Citi.

Jon Tower
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Just a couple, if I may. Maybe starting off, I know obviously, you're launching [Technical Difficulty] in the chicken group in April with advertising. I believe there's a soft launch now or soon in stores. But curious if you're attacking the marketing side of the equation any bit differently than what you've done with the previous 2 product launches on 3 For Me, the 2 burgers. I know it's -- you don't want to -- if it's not broke, you might not [Technical Difficulty] but is there a different tack you might be taking this go around?

Kevin Hochman
President, CEO & Director

Well, we think that high prices are more relevant than ever. So every time we think we're -- the consumer is going to get bored of our messaging, like this keeps coming back up in social media and in the zeitgeist. So -- and I think you guys see it all the time that consumers are really frustrated with high pricing in lots of different areas, not just restaurants. And so the idea of continuing to attack that head on with unbeatable value and abundance continues to win for us. So there's no reason why we would change that.

Jon Tower
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then just maybe shifting to the store-level employees and specifically thinking about incentives over time. Obviously, you have a fairly ambitious goal to get to roughly $6 million AUVs across the Chili's store base over time. I'm just curious how you're thinking about store level incentives for the managers and where they sit today versus where you might optimally see them going over time?

Kevin Hochman
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's something we talk about a lot. We look at like the best-in-class competitor and they are masters at ownership at the general manager level. And part of that is their incentive structure. They do other things, too, that we're obviously studying. And right now, we're in the camp of let's get our managers trained so they can be true owners of the business. For years, we started pulling things off of their P&L in effort to make their bonuses more fair and control more of what happens in the restaurant.

And we've got to unravel some of that so that they actually understand the P&L, understand the areas that they can improve their bottom line and their top line and then start rewarding for them once they're trained and have the tools to do that. So the first step has been, #1, we're launching a new P&L tool as part of our overall Oracle upgrade. That's done, and they've been trained on that.

Secondly, we're teaching the principles of extreme ownership to our managers. We started with our directors of operation and above, and now we've been rolling that out over to the general managers and the management team inside the restaurants. We're going to do that for at least a year, maybe even a little bit longer before we actually change the incentive structure.

I do anticipate that we will change the -- some of the long-term -- I'm sorry, some of the bonus structure for the directors and above before that. So we'll try to roll that out to the directors first and make sure that we got their buy and their understanding before we would ever go to the manager level. But we're at least 1 to 2 years out from actually changing the incentive structure of the managers.

Operator

Your next question is from John Ivankoe.

John Ivankoe
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. We're blaming this on the ice storm. So I'm in the airport, and this one is not going to drop. So the question was on remodels. Remodel is obviously a very important part of your story in '27, '28. I think I heard you say 60 to 80 remodels in '27, followed by a greater increase in '28. So just confirm that. And secondly, as we think about new unit development into '28 and beyond, I mean, that is something that you're planning to accelerate in the Chili's business in '28.

And I'm not going to ask you for TAM at this point on this conference call, but what are we thinking in terms of percent unit growth that's kind of right for the Chili's brand at this part of the brand's life cycle in ' 28 that maybe can be established for a long term. And Mika, you know where I'm getting with this question is how we should just think about broad capital intensity of the business in '27 and '28 as this is such an important part of our model.

Mika Ware
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So John, let me start with a lot of pieces to your question. First, yes, I'll confirm we want to ramp up in '27 -- fiscal '27 with the 60 to 80 is our current plan. And then the goal in '28 is to get to about 10% of the system, which would get us a little bit over 100%. So you did hear that right and we're very excited about it. Okay, on the new unit growth. And so what I would say is next year, we -- this year has been pretty flat with what we've opened versus what we've -- some of the leases expiring, et cetera, what we've closed.

Next year, you're not going to see that much of a bump because remember, it's an 18- to 24-month cycle. So that's from 2 years ago when we weren't really leaning into new units. But what I can tell you, with all the progress we've made on building the team and all of the sites that we have at the front end of the funnel that we're putting in, I do feel like you're going to see a significant difference in F '28 in the new units that we're able to post for that year. So that is correct.

We haven't communicated an exact target of new unit growth. But it will be in the low single digits, I would say, is something that could be in the realm of expectations for what we can do. So again, that will be something that we go into more detail on when we get to that Investor Day and talk about what we think the universe of Chili's could be, what we think that new unit growth cadence will be over time.

But we do know that we can build more Chili's, and we're really excited about it, especially with the change in the business. The areas of opportunities have opened up for us because our business is so much stronger on where we can build in different areas, different locations. We've learned a ton. So we're really excited about it as we move forward. So I hope that's helpful.

John Ivankoe
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

It is. And I guess as we're thinking at this point, I mean, do we think that there might be an opportunity long, long term to maybe double the Chili's brand relative to what it is? Or am I may be getting ahead of myself in kind of the question is just thinking about what this brand can be now that it has the returns, the permission, the capital to once again start to expand this footprint again.

Mika Ware
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Again, no, I don't know that we're ready to say the numbers. I think double is quite aggressive. But yes, we think we can build more Chili's and again, more to come. The great news is the company has plenty of capital available to do it, too. So that's not a constraint for us to continue to invest in the business and return to the shareholders. So we feel really good about our capital allocation strategy over time and our ability to invest back in the new unit growth and grow some profitable Chili's.

John Ivankoe
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Well, I'm really looking forward to the event for you guys to highlight all of your opportunities, so look forward to that.

Your next question is from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.

Brian Harbour
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Mika, just so I'm clear on the food cost comments. Are you saying sort of tariffs is helpful, but look, there's some other things that sort of offset that. So you say you're not really changing your outlook for commodities.

Mika Ware
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. No, my outlook for commodities, we did have favorability in the tariffs. So it is more favorable than it was last quarter. But what I'm saying is I'm reiterating that the back half of the year is going to be in that mid-single digit. That does include some of the investments we've made in things such as ribs and bacon. We made some investments in poultry. And so we're -- I'm just trying to level set everybody on commodities have looked pretty favorable in the front half.

In the back half, it will be that mid-single digit. And then to help guide people on what does that mean, I was just trying to say, hey, you've seen our food and beverage cost in quarter 2. I think we'll have a similar number in quarter 3 as we move forward. So just trying to help people kind of understand what would that turn into within 10 to 20 basis points.

Brian Harbour
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And with sort of the chicken sandwich revamp, did you change any of the timing at all on sort of the soft launches that still as expected? Are you -- is it fair to say you're not kind of giving yourselves credit for that in your revenue comments? Or you sort of just view it as one of the drivers that have been ongoing?

Kevin Hochman
President, CEO & Director

Go ahead, Mika.

Mika Ware
Executive VP & CFO

I would just say the chicken sandwich, what's in the guidance is we have it in over 200 restaurants now where we're getting all the learnings. The real launch will be late in April, and that's when we'll go on TV. And that's really critical for the chicken sandwich because this is about driving traffic with a very appealing product that we have. And so that's the timing that's built into the guidance that we gave. Kevin, you can give more color on that.

Kevin Hochman
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean the thing to understand is in the 200 restaurants, when you don't advertise it, you're just basically going to be moving mix. You might get a little bit of repeat, but if it's only a 3- or 4-month period, it's not going to be a ton of repeat that you get. So you're really just trying to test for what are consumers saying about the sandwich, can we execute it with excellence given it's going to drive a lot of mix the way you merchandise it, what is the feedback that we're getting on the sandwich.

But you're really not going to see a major change in the business other than some mix shifts until you launch the TV advertising and start bringing people in with the sandwich. So I wouldn't read too much into the restaurants that we put in other than it's encouraging. When you see something mix significantly more and the feedback is really good, that's always a good sign that it's going to do even better when you go on TV.

Operator

Your next question for today is from Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James.

Brian Vaccaro
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Kevin, just back to chicken sandwich, could you remind us just the changes that you made to quality and the flavor profile and maybe level set us on where your existing chicken sandwich mix is and just kind of how you frame that potential opportunity? And then more broadly, just what's your latest thinking on the timing for other menu upgrades? Are you still thinking about steaks and salads maybe moving into fiscal '27? Just curious there.

Kevin Hochman
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So I'll let Mika answer the exact mix question while I give you the update on the platform. So the first thing is the base sandwich, and we had fixed the recipe on that about a year ago, where we went to a very focused build that you see in kind of the most popular or the biggest innovation in, I would say, in fast food history or modern history, which is the Popeyes Chicken Sandwich is a very basic build, and we wanted to look at that and learn from that. And so that's what we did about a year ago.

We basically have a brioche bun, a semi-cured pickle, mayonnaise and a very large hand-breaded chicken breast that we think is incredibly abundant in the category. I mean I don't have the exact data to say it's the biggest, but when you eat it, you might think it's the biggest. And so that was done. And then we're going to start bringing in some flavor updates to it, which I can't go into the details of, but there'll be a variety of sandwiches in different benefit spaces based on some of the signature flavors that we have as well as a new flavor that we don't have in the restaurants today that mixed really well when Popeyes launched the sandwich.

And then we're going to have a good, better, best tiering of those sandwiches. So we'll have a base sandwich at a hot price point. We'll have a sandwich with benefits at a medium price point, and then we'll have the super-premium that will have like bacon and produce and things that you expect in the super premium sandwich at the super premium tier.

And then we're also going to bring some additional sides innovation and dip cup innovation to that lineup to make it even more exciting and more distinctly Chili's. So it really will look like a completely new lineup to the guests. And it's in areas that we know that consumers are excited about chicken sandwiches, but done in a very unique Chili's way, not just in the flavor profiles, but the abundance and value that we think that you're going to get.

Mika Ware
Executive VP & CFO

And so I'll talk about the mix, right now, the mix is very low, Brian, because we aren't merchandising it on the menu, it's not on TV. So it's just one item on the menu in our handhelds section. So very low, but there are big plans for how we merchandise it, how it's going to be on TV. So we do know that there is big room for mix to grow there. And we do think, again, the chicken sandwich is designed to be a traffic driver.

Brian Vaccaro
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

All right. That's very helpful. I was going to ask one on the balance sheet as well. Mika, you only have $20 million left on the revolver, I think, and you've got the $350 million notes at 8.25%. Just how are you thinking about the refi opportunity on the notes through calendar '26? And is there an opportunity to maybe move those notes onto the revolver second half of calendar '26 and maybe shave off a few hundred bps on the interest rate?

Mika Ware
Executive VP & CFO

Brian, right now, we don't have that in the works, but we are watching it closely. So if the opportunity arises where we can take out the bonds early and it makes sense for the revolver and save us some money, we'd absolutely do that. Remember, there's just different aspects of when you do it and the fees you have to pay upfront, but it is something we're watching. So right now, I would say we don't have that planned, but we're going to continue to watch it.

Your next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.

Eric Gonzalez
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the strong results. I'm just curious about the timing of marketing investments this year. I know there was an uptick in spend in the second quarter. So if you could just confirm that you stayed in that range of $9 million to $10 million incremental advertising? And then how does that look as you get into 3Q and 4Q, particularly around the chicken sandwich launch?

Mika Ware
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. No, we did stay in that, Eric. So we had the biggest increase year-over-year in Q2. So that did happen, and we said that was about 2.9% of sales. I think the percent of sales will stay fairly stable as we move forward. The year-over-year increase isn't as much in 3 and 4, but exactly what we said did happen in Q2.

Eric Gonzalez
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then just quickly, just regarding the winter storm. I mean, how quickly do you expect to bounce back there? And what are your expectations in terms of how long the effects could linger?

Mika Ware
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. No, that is the big question. So it was quite a challenge to be -- we had to quantify the impact of the storm while the storm is still happening and unfolding. So that is why I was pretty purposeful in saying this is what we know as of Tuesday and what the impacts are. So that is what we have built into that guidance. We'll see there. Historically, we have had some bounce back when people get a little bit of cabin fever. Now on the flip side, a little caution. We lost a Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

We're in a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday when it bounces back. So there could be some upside. But what I will say is we don't have a ton of upside built in that we just kind of have all systems go from Wednesday on. So upside or downside on the storm could still be kind of playing out a little bit. But we think we got the bulk of the impact captured with what I communicated earlier and the $20 million decrease in revenue and the $0.15 to EPS.

Your next question is from Christine Cho with Goldman Sachs.

Hyun Jin Cho
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. In the last call, you mentioned that the under $60,000 income cohort was your fastest-growing group, contrary to kind of the broader industry trends. Have these trends continued into this quarter? And are there any other observations on spending across various consumer cohorts? And additionally, are you concerned at all that the QSR pricing growth continues to track below the casual dining average and how that would impact the overall category value perception?

Kevin Hochman
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So from an income cohort standpoint, we didn't see much shifting in the quarter, like the low-income cohort is no longer the fastest growing. So there was a little bit of shift down and a little bit of shift to the higher income cohorts, but it wasn't anything like that was so obvious that will be willing -- we should proactively highlight to you guys on the call. So -- but just a little bit. We haven't seen any kind of trade down, like mix has been pretty healthy.

So I would say not really made any major shifts or changes versus last quarter. I know that's a little bit of bucking the trend from what you see in the industry, but I also think that we do have industry-leading value, which is helping insulate us to some extent. As far as the QSR question that you -- the second part of your question, I'd say we still have industry-leading value on TV.

We still have -- when you look at casual dining having a renaissance and when you look at our -- I mentioned on my prepared comments, when you look at the PPA or per person average versus our casual dining competitive set, direct competitive set, we're $3 under them. We're $4 under the broader casual dining. So we don't really -- we feel like we're really positioned to win regardless of what happens with the macro between the operational improvements that we've made, where we've positioned ourselves and then our everyday value, which looks pretty darn good.

So I'm not particularly concerned. I think we get asked that every time a competitor from Chicago decides to put a $5 meal out there, and we just keep chugging along. And I think it's because when you look at the overall value for what you pay for what you get, it does feel superior to what's out there, and we're going to continue to deliver that.

Your next question for today is from Sara Senatore with Bank of America.

Sara Senatore
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just I guess, maybe a couple of clarifications. One, Mika, you pointed out that you had positive mix in terms of the check impact, but I think negative in terms of margins. Can you just talk about that? I mean, it didn't sound like there was a lot of shift in terms of consumption or guest kind of choice, but I don't know if that was maybe a little bit more on the value side. And then also, sorry if I missed it, but you lowered the CapEx guide. I don't think that's because of the lower kind of cost of remodels. It sounds like those are still in test, but just wanted to maybe understand that, too.

Mika Ware
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. Yes. Great, Sara. So first of all, we'll start with the mix. Yes, mix was positive and a little less positive. One reason that margins went down year-over-year was, if you remember last year, it was really about the lapping of last year when we accelerated our business, took a huge step change in the business. We weren't able to staff our labor as quickly as we needed to a year ago, October. So we kind of over-earned in quarter 2, which I caution people about as we were lapping that even coming into this year.

So I think that's probably what's in play with the margins more than just the overall health of the margins and the health of the business and the flow-through. So again, that's kind of the -- what kind of was built in the run rate. The same with the restaurant expense. As our restaurants got busier, it took us a little bit to ramp up and get those expenses caught up with kind of the new traffic levels. And we've continued to invest in the business, and now we're lapping some of that.

So I feel really good about the flow-through and the margin profile overall. So it's really strong and really healthy. And if I take a step back and just look at the full year, I guided that I think we can improve restaurant level margins 30 to 40 basis points. even with the impacts of the storm that could put a little pressure on us, I still feel very confident in that number on growing the margins over time.

So I feel like if there's any variability in the quarter-to-quarter, it's really back to some timing of expenses or investments and a little bit of seasonality, but I feel really good about margins overall. Great question about CapEx. Really just taking a look at it at the midpoint of the year, we realized it's not necessarily because reimages are less expensive. We're still finalizing the scope of that.

We are doing a few less than we originally planned. I think the bigger nugget in is there is we had a placeholder for maybe a potential new equipment rollout that now after the teams have moved down a little bit further on that, we realized we aren't going to have a new big equipment rollout. So we went ahead and updated that in our forecast and just tightened it up a little bit. So plenty of capital out there. We're just tightening up the forecast.

Sara Senatore
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the margin, I guess I was referring to COGS specifically. You had said it was, I think, 20 basis points unfavorable because of menu...

Mika Ware
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. So that is really what we're seeing is there's a lot of investments into the quality of the food that we're lapping. So ribs is very material investment. We talked about we were serving one-third ribs and two-thirds. We did the big shift from imported ribs to domestic ribs. So that's just an example of we put a lot more of quantity and quality into the cost of sales line. And so that's where I'm just saying, hey, you see kind of a new run rate in cost of sales.

It's a combination of we do have some more -- we still have commodity inflation in there, but then the investments we're making into that COGS line. And so that's kind of what's hitting there. And if you do mix into some more expensive items, which is fine, that puts a little pressure there. You always have higher penny profit, but if you're selling more of the more expensive one, there's some more cost of sales associated with that, too.

Your next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.

Jeffrey Bernstein
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Kevin, I was intrigued by your prior comments on the restaurant level leadership model. I think you mentioned that you have a peer that successfully operates with a market partner -- more of a market partner ownership model more akin to maybe a franchise model, which you know well from past days. So I'm wondering if you could just -- any more color conceptually about the pros and cons versus the more traditional company-operated manager model that most of the industry uses.

It does sound like maybe you're considering a shift. I know others have talked about the potential to benefit retention, engagement, compensation. Just wondering if there any more color in terms of how you would implement it. It would seem like that will be a material change to your economic model, but presumably more of an ownership structure for long-term further improvements. So any incremental color would be great.

Kevin Hochman
President, CEO & Director

So I think conceptually, all of the stakeholders are aligned that we want to do something here because like we believe that when we hear it from the managers, they want to have more of a stake and ownership in the company, especially when they see with how the company has performed. We believe that it would be a good thing for them to have more ownership over the results, both in terms of their personal compensation as well as just how they run the restaurants.

So I don't think anybody is really debating like should we do it? It's really the how. And the challenge for us is when you benchmark the model that you were talking about earlier, they tend to pay lower base salaries and then they put more into the variable comp. And that puts us in a difficult position because we're not going to lower base salaries and put it in the variable comp. That's not going to be received very well.

So we've really got to figure out what's the how to do this in a way that is going to work for everybody and not just hope that in the year that we make the change that people aren't upset about it because they would be because you're moving comp that you can be confident into something that's more variable. So we've got to figure out a way that wins for everybody and not just on 1 or 2 items. So that's what we're going to have to work through. At the same time, we've still got a couple of years where we just got to continue to build skills and capability in the ability to own the restaurants.

So that means building the best team, holding people accountable, making sure that you really are owning your restaurant and the facility. These are new muscles that, quite frankly, we haven't asked these guys to do in a while that we've got to build up over time before we change any incentive structure. So -- and I wish it was more simple and we could just flip a switch and kind of replicate the models that we see that works, but we're just starting from a different place.

Your next question is from Andrew Strelzik with BMO.

Andrew Strelzik
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

I was wondering if you're seeing the mix of traffic growth shift between new customers and increasing frequency. And I guess what I'm trying to think through is, as you brought back all these new customers over the last couple of years as you kind of work through the brand repositioning, is the opportunity mix between those 2 buckets evolving and kind of how you potentially evolve the strategy to address the 2 buckets as you move forward?

Kevin Hochman
President, CEO & Director

Andrew, it's Kevin. We don't see really a change in how we're doing this. It's pretty simple. It's like, #1, continue to have a great experience so that you don't leak guests. And so that's what we see on the frequency of existing guests that's not changing and then use our world-class marketing and great value offer and great new positioning to drive new guests in. And so if you're not leaking guests and you're bringing new guests in and then they quickly are starting to look like existing guests in terms of their frequency pattern, that's a recipe for sustainable growth.

So what I lean on my team is don't change that strategy, but we better have ideas every quarter to get better and better on the experience because that's the flywheel. We know the marketing guys can do it. They're doing it right now. They're continuing to just really reinvent the industry and what can be done with advertising and marketing and hats off to them. So as long as we continue to improve our experience over time, there's no reason why this run won't stop.

So I don't anticipate changing the strategy. It's just making sure that we continue to execute it quarter after quarter so we continue that because the key to this whole thing is having a great experience because that's going to both retain existing guests and stop the leak and be able to attract new guests because of the things that people are saying about our brand. And we're just going to continue to do that.

Andrew Strelzik
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. That's helpful. And one clarification. Last quarter, you talked about the earnings drag for Maggiano's. Can you share what that looks like through the back half of the year?

Mika Ware
Executive VP & CFO

Andrew, that's me. So really, just what I would say is in the guidance that I gave, we haven't changed the expectations for Maggiano's very much. And so what we're expecting is their same-store sales will probably be in the negative mid-single-digit range for the back half of the year. So probably just more of the same on that. So if we get some more green shoots out of Maggiano's, and I think we can start improving that, but they're still going to have a drag year-over-year in their margins.
