[Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Ankur Rudra from JPMorgan.

Ankur Rudra
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Good to see a nice print here. Just first couple of questions on the revenue and the demand side. The signs have been quite strong for the last couple of quarters, momentum has been quite strong as well. I'm just curious why the outlook -- the implied outlook for fourth quarter can't be stronger than it is. And secondly, I just want to confirm that your comment is for a growth acceleration in F '27 for the overall business and not for a segment alone? And are you seeing any signs of short-cycle projects or discretionary spending expanding beyond financial services and energy also, especially when you think about F '27?

Salil Parekh
MD, CEO & Director

Ankur, this is Salil. So first, on what we are seeing in terms of the momentum and the deals, all of that has led to the increase in the guidance keeping in mind the overall picture. So we mentioned -- Jayesh mentioned a little bit about financial services, about energy, utilities, the overall deal. And then if you look at some of our other sectors, we are still seeing those sectors starting to come up, but not at that level. So keeping all of that in mind, we've increased the guidance for what we see in Q4.

On the numbers for next year, so what we have shared today is in the 2 verticals, energy, utilities, resources and services, and in financial services, we see that the growth on financial year '27 to '26 will be good, and that is because of the deals we have won large and other deals and the AI where we have partners with 15 of the large -- of our large 25 clients. So those 2 things especially are giving us that view. We are not making a comment on the overall. We are not saying anything on the overall at this stage.

Jayesh Sanghrajka
Chief Financial Officer

Ankur, if I can just add to what Salil was saying on guidance and your question on why Q4 guidance cannot be elevated more. You should also remember that there is a lower working day calendar day impact in this quarter, which is usually seasonally there. So that is also a headwind from the guidance perspective.

Ankur Rudra
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Appreciate it. Just a question for you, Jayesh, as well on the margin side. Margins appear to be down 20 basis points if I adjust the gains from the sale -- property sale this time. Could you highlight if you're seeing any kind of pricing pressure? And also, how do you see the puts and takes going forward? Also, given a lot more disclosure on the AI side, which is appreciated, I'm curious if AI is a headwind or a tailwind on your margins when you do these 4,600 AI projects.

Jayesh Sanghrajka
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So you're right, there was a benefit that we got this quarter, and I did call that out that we that benefit was largely offset by the higher variable pay that we also provided in the financial statements this quarter. So that's the put and take of the margin. On the pricing, if you look at our consistent pricing commentary has been that our pricing is accretive. We have seen consistently our pricing going up on back of various factors, including AI, including Project Maximus. Newgen pricing is part of the Project Maximus, which includes how do you price these new AI projects, et cetera, of reagents, et cetera. So we don't really see an impact or a headwind coming because of the AI projects on pricing, especially.

Next question is from the line of Bryan from TD Cowen.

Bryan Bergin
TD Cowen, Research Division

I wanted to ask on North America. So just your comment on your view going forward here, at least in the coming quarters, you see it just dipped down to a contraction of minus 1% on a year-on-year basis. Was that due to any particular industries? And just how do you see that progressing here as you go through March and beyond?

Salil Parekh
MD, CEO & Director

So Bryan, this is what we had called out at the beginning of the year when we provided our original guidance that looking at the deals in the pipeline, looking at the projects that we have and the projects or large deals that were under execution, we expected this year, the third-party cost and therefore, the third-party revenue to be lower than the last year.

It's across segments. Of course, the impact of it by segment could vary, but the impact is across segments.

Bryan Bergin
TD Cowen, Research Division

Okay. Understood. And then just as it relates to the commentary on budgets going forward, can you just comment on the conversations you're having with enterprises now as it relates to their calendar '26 budgets. As you think about this right now versus this time last year, any key changes worth noting?

Salil Parekh
MD, CEO & Director

So this is Salil. I think what we see now is, first, the comment that we made earlier on energy, utilities, vertical and financial services. In financial services, we also see discretionary work that is more prevalent. And then we see much more activity on AI. And in the AI area, what we are starting to identify as the 6 value pools, areas where we can drive faster growth. We are seeing traction on that. And with some of the partnerships we've announced and some others that we're already working with companies on, we see good momentum. So those are the 2 things that we are seeing. Some of the discretionary in FS, good momentum in those 2 energy utilities and financial services. And then in AI, more activity, which is different from this time of last year.

Next question is from the line of Ashwin Mehta from AMBIT Capital.

Ashwin Mehta
AMBIT Capital Private Limited, Research Division

So just one question in terms of health care. It seems to have done pretty well this quarter, almost $44 million of incremental revenues, which is nearly double of our overall incremental revenues. So what is the driver of the health care growth? And secondly, was there any contribution from the NHS deal in this quarter?

Salil Parekh
MD, CEO & Director

Yes, Ashwin, Healthcare did benefit from the contribution from the NHS deal that we signed.

Ashwin Mehta
AMBIT Capital Private Limited, Research Division

And we expect residual contribution as you get into the next quarter or this is kind of scaled up?

Salil Parekh
MD, CEO & Director

Ashwin, we don't provide deal by deal the revenue estimates per se, right? But yes, health care did benefit from the NHS.

Ashwin Mehta
AMBIT Capital Private Limited, Research Division

Fair. And the second question is in terms of wage hikes. I missed the initial comments, but any decision in terms of the wage hikes? And are they expected in 4Q?

Salil Parekh
MD, CEO & Director

Yes. So on the wage hike, whenever we decide that we've always considered multiple factors; when was the last wage hike was done, what are the market scenarios, the inflation, et cetera, et cetera. If you look at this calendar, we've already done -- rolled out wage hikes in 2 stages, effective -- one part was effective January, the other one was effective April, like we always do. So we haven't decided the next cycle yet.

Next question is from the line of Abhishek Pathak from Motilal Oswal.

Abhishek Pathak
Motilal Oswal Securities Limited, Research Division

Congrats on a good quarter. So a couple of questions. Firstly, do you think this is the year when clients kind of move from the AI strategy being good to have to something of a necessity, right, which means that is this a year when foundational AI work starts getting taken seriously across verticals? That's the first one.

And secondly, on the Cognition deal being a very interesting sort of partnership. Sort of very curious to know how you're pricing this, how you're taking it to clients? I mean, is Devin kind of initially leading to a bit of cannibalization in revenues? And sort of how are those contracts structured? And over the next 1 to 2 years, how do you expect a typical deal with, let's say, an agent like Devin and yourself sort of structured? So those are 2 questions.

Salil Parekh
MD, CEO & Director

So on the first one, what we are seeing is there is more and more interest in AI work across different industries. So we will continue to see that going through the year. We will now watch and see because every quarter so far and especially in Q3, we have seen that interest, our pipeline, the number of projects, our penetration of our large 200 clients with AI work, all of that is going up, and it's across those different verticals. There is much more activity there, which we called out in financial services, but we also see that in telco. We see that in pharma, health care. We see that in energy utilities. We see a little bit in life sciences. So it's not like only one sector. But yes, in FS, it's quite a bit more.

On Cognition, the way that works is basically the Devon software agent and our work, we are doing joint work in clients already today. So what tends to happen is there are certain sets of activity. For example, we see some things on legacy modernization where in the past, that was a large long commitment for clients. With this sort of combination between a software agent and Infosys and our knowledge of the client landscape and of the industry, those things become much more addressable. And so those sorts of newer areas, those are the 6 value pools that I referenced earlier. This is one of them. Those are the new areas that start to come into play. And in this particular case with Devin, that's one example. There are others where that agent can be used in different places. And that's the type of growth we are seeing because that's new work that would ordinarily not have been done at all, but now can be attempted in a combination.

Next question is from the line of Jonathan Lee from Guggenheim Securities.

Yu Lee
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Can you speak to the level of visibility and certainty you have in your implied fiscal 4Q revenue growth relative to the visibility you've had in prior years around this time?

Jayesh Sanghrajka
Chief Financial Officer

Jonathan, this is Jayesh here. I mean, whenever we have looked at the guidance, we do take into account multiple factors, the deals that we have signed, the deals that are ramping up and the usual factors affecting the quarter like calendar days, working days, et cetera, et cetera. So I think that is what has gone into guidance this time as well. What I can tell you is at the lower end, we have baked in a higher amount of uncertainty. And at the higher end, we have baked in a better macro environment.

Yu Lee
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

That's good color. And a follow-up, can you help us reconcile what you're seeing around subcontractor usage in the quarter versus the downtick in utilization you're seeing? Is there a skills gap that you might be facing? And how should we think about that dynamic going forward?

Jayesh Sanghrajka
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So subcon historically, you're right, is always a factor of where the skill gaps are, where the skills that you need depending on the geography, depending on the tenure of the requirement, et cetera. And that is how the subcon uptick or downtick happens in the market in our scenario, and that is what has happened this quarter as well. There are some of the large deals, there are some of the deals which would have started ramping up and we would have -- we needed to dip into the subcontractors to fulfill those requirements, which is what is reflected in the uptick.

Next question is from the line of Vibhor Singhal from Nuvama.

Vibhor Singhal
Nuvama Wealth Management Limited, Research Division

Congrats on a solid performance. Salil, my question was on 2 key verticals, manufacturing and the High-Tech division. So manufacturing, just wanted to pick your brains on how are you seeing the traction in this vertical, given the kind of headwinds the auto companies are seeing globally in terms of their EV rollouts and the competition. How are different parts of the manufacturing vertical looking like at this point of time? And do you expect the momentum to pick up in that?

On the High-Tech vertical, just again, I think we saw a sharp drop in this quarter, might have been due to seasonality of furloughs. But anything that you're looking at? This vertical has been around $370 million, $380 million kind of run rate for us for quite a while now. What are you looking at in this vertical in terms of next drivers of growth? And are we seeing any momentum building up in this in the near future?

Salil Parekh
MD, CEO & Director

On manufacturing, as you mentioned, there is weakness in automotive and in some parts of industrial across Europe. We see some strength in some elements where the manufacturing, and this is partially in U.S., partially in Europe, is supplying capability, which is coming for the build-out of the data centers and so on. So there are some of those companies which are benefiting from that. But the automotive side, as you mentioned, we see that continuing to be weak. We are focused on expanding our base there. So we are looking at and have successfully worked now with multiple automotive companies. And we also see that going beyond automotive as the broader manufacturing, which is supplying capabilities to the boom in AI and data center activity, not the services is what is going to help us in manufacturing.

On High-tech, similarly, there's groups of companies which are strong. There are groups which need more attention, and we have a portfolio of those companies. Overall, there is still cost pressure in High-tech, and we will push. There is a lot of productivity activity that is going on there where clients are looking for productivity benefits. And they are also looking some of them for where they will get their growth into -- again, some of the companies which are supplying servers, et cetera, we are seeing those are doing pretty well with the AI boom. The others are looking for where are the growth elements that are going to come, and we are supporting that work. And high-tech also at this stage, we see some constraints in that industry.

Vibhor Singhal
Nuvama Wealth Management Limited, Research Division

But just to further on that. Do you see this vertical maybe picking up for us, not in immediate term, but let's say, in the medium to long term, given that the widespread adoption of AI should be -- and these companies should be at the -- some of these companies should be at the forefront of that. Do you think this vertical could be a good growth driver for us maybe sometime down the line?

Salil Parekh
MD, CEO & Director

So I think in the medium term or longer, my sense is high-tech is a good industry. We are very comfortable to be in it, as you pointed out, with different ways of AI impacting it across different value pools, they will also go through those changes.

But we have to make sure that we are providing them the services that they're looking for and in a way that they have a lot of cost pressures today that becomes manageable in their cost structure. But I mean, there's no time line in my mind. But yes, in the medium term or beyond, high-tech is a good industry for us.

Vibhor Singhal
Nuvama Wealth Management Limited, Research Division

Got it. Got it. Just one last question for Jayesh. Jayesh, as this quarter we took this exceptional item on the labor law impact. I would assume that the entire impact that we had to take has been taken. And for next quarter, there wouldn't be any exceptional item anymore. And what would be the recurring impact of this new labor laws on our P&L in terms of margins?

Jayesh Sanghrajka
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So whatever is known at this point in time on back of the regulation that has been -- that has changed is being taken this quarter. We don't expect -- unless, of course, there are changes in the regulation, we don't expect any further impact going forward as one-off. The recurring impact of this would be 15 basis points on an ongoing basis approximately.

Next question is from the line of Keith Bachman from BMO Capital.

Keith Bachman
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Could you speak to how you anticipate revenue per employee changing over the next couple of years? And the spirit of the question is driven by trying to better understand how you see emphasis in the industry. One of the core value propositions has been managing people and growing in terms of managing agents instead of managing people.

Salil Parekh
MD, CEO & Director

Yes. So Keith, it is similar to what we have seen in any other technology wave. If you are ahead of the curve, you will see an increase in your productivity because of the premium that you can keep with you. If you're behind the curve, then you probably will see a dip. The only measurement that would change here is the premium is measured now in terms of productivity. So if you are delivering better productivity, you would be able to keep some of that with you, which is -- which will get reflected in pricing, better pricing.

If you are behind the curve in delivering the productivity, you would see a dip in pricing. So that's how you will see in a traditional environment, the only change I would say is the pricing models per se are also changing and emerging. There are newer and newer pricing models are emerging, how do you price agents, how do you price the underlying platform, et cetera. But early days to say at this point in time, how will that reflect in terms of linearity or nonlinearity.

Keith Bachman
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. Okay. And the second one is more micro is could you speak to -- there's been some recent press reports about your relationship with Daimler in terms of maybe that moving away. Could you speak to anything you could comment on Daimler and/or is the Q4 guidance reflecting any attrition in contracts, large contracts? Or should we be thinking about if we look over the horizon into FY '27, should we be considering any major attrition -- any attrition from any major contracts? And that's it for me.

Salil Parekh
MD, CEO & Director

Yes. So Keith, our current contracts are valid till December end -- till December '26. So we don't really see any contracts within that expiring at this point in time. Beyond that, we don't really give a color on a client-specific or a project-specific details.

Next question is from the line of Gaurav Rateria from Morgan Stanley.

Gaurav Rateria
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

My question is on the deal renewal cycle. Any color that you can share on what has been the experience on your renewals in last several quarters? Specifically, you did mention about a comment that the legacy part of the business is seeing some compression on refresh because of the AI cycle. So any trend on which service lines are seeing that most visibly in your experience? And is that also -- does that also mean that your overall renewals may have a little bit higher leakage than usually that you used to have, let's say, in the past because of the whole narrative around AI deflation that is coming on the legacy services?

Salil Parekh
MD, CEO & Director

I'm sorry, Gaurav, we actually got dropped off. Would you be able to repeat the question, please?

Gaurav Rateria
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

My question is on the deal renewal cycle. Your comment did allude to significant productivity benefit on the legacy services. So anything that you could share from what you have seen on the renewals of your larger deals, specifically using some of the AI tools? What has been the learning there? Has there been some amount of leakage, which has been higher than usual?

Salil Parekh
MD, CEO & Director

Gaurav, this is Salil. So on the large deals, we are typically seeing whether it's renewals or also deals which are -- we are winning from other companies where we are beneficiaries of consolidation. Typically, across the board, there is a large expectation from clients on AI productivity benefits. What we have done is we have modeled in what we are seeing today and built a path to that because these are typically 3-, 5-year deals. But we are also not in a position where sometimes the client expectations over 5 years are very different.

So we have what we are seeing and there we can view what that sort of a benefit is that we can provide because these are multiyear sort of deals. Having said that, we don't see -- in fact, we are winning on large deals quite a lot. If you look at the numbers in the 3 quarters, we have done more than the full year of the previous year. And Q3 was already $4.8 billion. We've seen some net new deals, for example, NHS.

So yes, there is that productivity. But yes, we are also benefiting from consolidation and winning things across the board where my sense is we are gaining on the market share side.

Gaurav Rateria
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. My next question on your visibility for CY '26, fair to say that looks better than the last year because last year, you entered into the year where you had a big decline in the fourth quarter because of some specific issues. And this year, your guidance alludes to kind of a much better fourth quarter outlook. So your exit rate is much better than the last year. Does it mean that it gives you a little bit of a tailwind when you get into the FY '27 compared to last year when you got into FY '26?

Salil Parekh
MD, CEO & Director

I think the way you have described it, you have done the maths on that one because what we can see is -- our guidance for the full year, we have the range, which gives us a good traction on Q4 with a lot of the good deals that have come and what we saw in Q3. Then we are seeing the discretionary coming back in financial services. Then we are seeing energy, utilities and financial services looking better in the next financial year than this financial year. And then we are seeing in AI services, the 6 value pools where we see a good growth opportunity. So all in all, that gives us a good, let's say, good view of next year.

Next question is from the line of Sandeep Shah from Equirus Securities.

Sandeep Shah
Equirus Securities Private Limited, Research Division

Congrats on a good set of numbers. Salil, first question, are you witnessing the average size of AI-led deals are going up materially on a Y-o-Y basis across sectors? And just a follow-up, if answer to this is being yes, one can say clients are now in a state of mind where they don't fear in terms of modernization of legacy applications. And if that is true, can it lead to a better discretionary spend on that side of the services in CY '26 versus last year?

Salil Parekh
MD, CEO & Director

On the AI part, so there are 2 things. One is there are deals which are only AI. One is where AI is pervasive in every -- in a service we are offering. So it's difficult, therefore, to say the size of the deal. But in general, the usage of AI is much more across all our services. And the actual only AI, if you can call it like that, deals are also going better. So that's what's happening.

I think on that modernization, if I understood, yes, we are seeing that across the board because AI can open up that and make it a little bit more efficient for the client and therefore, more -- like they'll have a better return on that. And then will the discretionary come after that? That one, we don't know, meaning it depends on the industry situation also for that. Like what we see right now is in financial services, we are seeing it. But the other industries, we'll see how they play out as each one we've given some color. That will be different for different industries is what we think.

Sandeep Shah
Equirus Securities Private Limited, Research Division

Okay. Okay. And just a follow-up to this. Is there a traction in terms of number of deals below $50 million has now started increasing and this could be a trend to continue rather than volatile trend earlier? And just 2 questions to Jayesh. Is it fair to assume third-party items as their cost line as a percentage to revenue for this year, which we guided at the start of the year, may be stable here on or may further decline beyond FY '26. And Jayesh, this INR 165 crores profit on property, plant and equipment, will it be a headwind in the fourth quarter?

Salil Parekh
MD, CEO & Director

Let me start on the first piece. Typically, below that $50 million, we are not sharing because only the large deals data we are sharing externally. The only sort of comment we can share is, overall, our wins are looking good. And also we are doing work with smaller accounts, which is not to comment on the overall $50 million below deal, but on smaller accounts, there we are also seeing some good growth. And then Jayesh, on the other parts?

Jayesh Sanghrajka
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So Sandeep, this is Jayesh here. If you look at the third-party deals this year, beginning of the year, we had said we expect the third-party cost to be lower than the previous year on back of the deals that we signed in last year that were getting ramped up, the deals that we saw in the pipeline. So that's a combination that we need to look out for when we guide for that. We don't have all the details at this point in time for the next year. We will get into next year, and we will let you know on that at that point in time. So that was one.

You had a second question on the INR 165 crores. I didn't get the exact question on that, if you could repeat.

Sandeep Shah
Equirus Securities Private Limited, Research Division

Yes. What I meant is these kind of a line item may not reoccur every quarter. So is it fair to assume 35, 36 bps, which has been a benefit in this quarter could be a headwind in next quarter?

Jayesh Sanghrajka
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So there are always some one-offs, right, that you get some headwinds, some tailwinds. Sometimes it's in revenue line item, sometimes it's a cost line item for a company of this size. So that is always there. As I talked about in my margin walk also, this was largely offset by -- or more than offset by the increase in variable pay as well.

Operator

Next question is from the line of Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna International.

James Friedman
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

I had 2 questions. I'll just ask them upfront. Salil, it's great to see the improvement in discretionary and financial services. I was wondering if you have any comment as to whether you're seeing that or anticipating that expand into other verticals. And you mentioned Energy and Resources.

And then my second question is, in terms of your thinking about the journey between AI and agentification, it seems like your thinking has evolved more towards the agentification. If you could -- and I imagine you'll address this at the Analyst Day, but if you could think -- if you could describe how you are thinking about the productization of your AI initiatives relative to those 2 dimensions. So first, AI and then agentification?

Salil Parekh
MD, CEO & Director

So on the first, I think -- on financial services, we are absolutely seeing that, which we shared. On energy utilities, because of the deals and the fact that we are in the top 15 of 25 clients doing AI work, we see clearly next financial year will be growth over this financial year. We are looking in other places as that discretionary will start to come back. And as it does, we will absolutely share that. We do feel that overall, from what we see on AI, what we see with possibilities on the economic growth, GDP growth and so on in the U.S. that those signs will give us the clients the ability to spend on tech. But as we see it, we will share that for sure on the other industries.

On AI, so first, agents are very much in a big play today. So we are absolutely on the forefront of that. So what we have built within Topaz is fabric, Topaz Fabric, we call it, is a set of purpose-built agents, which work with many different native AI companies interfaces and can support a lot of different functions within clients, horizontal and vertical. So that suite is going to be our agent suite.

Then there are agents of the other companies, which we will integrate, implement, expand, make it work because we know the tech landscape of a client, and we know the industry depth. So there, we feel quite good that we are in a better position than many people to put that. In terms of productization, we have built 4 small language models. In our own product suite, in Finacle, we will be much more AI orientated. But we are not at today's stage planning to do large-scale foundational model work. We are going to do small language model work.

We will do other things, for example, there are a set of AI wrappers or orchestration modules that we can build, which will enable clients to switch between foundation models, switch between agents, do a selection of agents, but those are not -- so that's a different type of product platform, which is all in Topaz. So that is the way we are thinking about it today. We may, in the future, have something more, but that's like the current view.

Operator

So the line for the participant dropped. We move to the next participant. Next question is from the line of Dipesh Mehta from Emkay Global.

Dipesh Mehta
Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd., Research Division

Two questions. First about the 6 areas of AI services pool, which you referred to. Can you provide some sense about the potential growth opportunities? And where, let's say, Infosys is currently and how you expect it to evolve in maybe next 3 to 5 years? Maybe if you can share some participation metrics, how -- where we are and how you expect it to evolve?

Second question is on the CY '26 budget. If you can provide some early indication on how you expect it to shape up?

Salil Parekh
MD, CEO & Director

So on the first one, what we are thinking is in that 6 areas, today, we are starting to do work in many of those areas. But what we want to do is in our Investor Day, go into a little bit more depth. For example, we will share like in several industries, what we are doing in some of the areas. We will share like we have AI labs on campus, and we want to do a little walk through to show like actually the work that is going on. And we will also share like the scale of what we think that opportunity is and the possible growth dynamics in that. So that's our planning for that Investor Day.

And the second one, what did you ask?

Dipesh Mehta
Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd., Research Division

CY '26 budget...

Salil Parekh
MD, CEO & Director

So that we will come to it in the April time frame when we finish the year. We are now in the process of working on that. We will share that in that April call.

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, we'll take that as the last question. I'll now hand the conference over to the management for closing comments.

Salil Parekh
MD, CEO & Director

Okay. Thank you, everyone, for joining and for such a detailed and insightful set of questions. I just want to leave a few comments. First, we've had a strong quarter, good large deals, increase in our guidance. Our 9-month margin sits at 21%. We've actually done that after absorbing a very strong increase in our sales cost of 50 basis points and with some lower utilization, which we are building capacity for the future.

We also see a huge shift on AI, which we shared in some of the 6 areas plus some of the partnerships. We start to see discretionary coming back in financial services. And in energy, utilities and financial services, we start to see that next year looking better than this year. So overall, we feel good as we go into the fourth quarter with our increase in guidance. Thank you, everyone, and catch you at the next quarterly call.

Operator

Thank you very much. Thank you, members of the management.

Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Infosys Limited, that concludes this conference. Thank you all for joining us, and you may now disconnect your lines. Thank you.
