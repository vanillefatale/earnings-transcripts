[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.


Amit Daryanani
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Impressive set of results here despite the stock reaction today. Gio, I'm hoping you could just maybe help us understand the order uptick you're seeing that you're talking about today, up 60%. What is sort of driving this? And really, the part I would love to understand is when we see Oracle report at $300 billion-plus RPO number or OpenAI announced a 10-gigawatt deal with NVIDIA, what's the cadence for these big announcements to flow into orders and revenues for Vertiv? I suspect none of these multiple recent announcements have really made it to orders for the ecosystem yet. But I'd love to understand just a little bit on what's driving this order growth in September and the time frame for when these big headlines we're seeing start to become orders for the company?


Giordano Albertazzi
CEO & Director

So first of all, Amit, thank you for your question. So certainly, the drivers are a combination of things, a very good market, certainly the technology evolution in the market that goes in our direction. Certainly, an industry that trust the ability to scale that Vertiv is displaying. And what we have multiple times being vocal about our competitive advantages, our service, our technology, et cetera. So all things that certainly drive that demand combined with a reliable execution.

On the Oracle side, as an example, I don't want to go too specific. But in general, we see some of the players -- many of the players, the large players in this space that talk about backlog expansion that really has to do with their service agreements. So I don't want to go into details of what these customers and how they look and measure their backlog. But typically, those are a different type of backlog, different type of agreements.

And on the back of this, the back of these plans and facts and commercial situations, we have an infrastructure that is being built -- and that build-out is rapid, but gradual nonetheless. So the dynamics of the orders to Vertiv or to the likes of us relative to the dynamics of the order intake and the backlog of our customers can be very different, but there are 2 sides of the same very positive coin, if you will, but they beat to a slightly different drum, if you [indiscernible].

We now have the next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research.


Scott Davis
Melius Research LLC

Congrats on having a great year so far. Geo, since you emphasized it on Slide 5, kind of the services opportunity here, could you give us a little bit more color on perhaps the margin structure of services versus equipment, the growth rate? Is it outgrowing equipment? Or since we're in such a hypergrowth period for equipment, perhaps it's not, but it comes in later. Just a little bit more color about how that service opportunity kind of flows through the P&L over the next few years.


Giordano Albertazzi
CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks for the question, Scott. So the -- clearly, we love our service business a lot. We believe it's a unique competitive advantage, uniquely strong competitive -- competitive advantage. Certainly accretive. Now if you go to Page 5, you see there are various components to our services portfolio. We, of course, have different -- slightly different dynamics in the various components. But certainly, overall accretive to our business and certainly generating a lot of recurring revenue in everything that is linked to everything life cycle services optimization. It's a very robust business.

But in times where the product systems side of the business is growing at this pace, typically, and it's very normal that the service business lags. But again, it's a very strong flywheel that is catching up speed. So it's almost bound to happen. It's going to happen. We see it accelerating. We like the direction in which it is going. And quite frankly, I'm really, let's say, excited about the technology that we're bringing about. So it's really the combination of technology and capacity and presence and customer experiences. So expect that to continue to accelerate, that flywheel continue to accelerate. I think an important element is that the type of equipment that is being deployed, the density of technology that is being deployed nowadays new and newer data center is certainly conducive to more business service penetration.

Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.


C. Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just you guys had said, I think, in the release or maybe in the presentation that you're on track for -- I think it was the margins that are embedded in kind of the long-term outlook. I would assume that, that means that's more of -- that's kind of more of an absolute margin comment. So if revenues are looking better that we should assume that those margins are good, but that would obviously imply a bit lower decremental margin. I guess I'm just curious as to kind of the outlook for -- or sorry, incremental margin.

The outlook for incrementals. And once you get through these tariffs, can we kind of get back on the horse of 35%? Or are we now in a point where with the types of projects you're doing and all the modular work and things like that, that maybe a little bit less than more revenue, same margins, which is still very good, but not quite the incremental, same incremental.


David Fallon
Chief Financial Officer

No, I understand your question, Steve. This is David. I would say our path to the 25% long-term margin target in 2029 stays intact. I think we certainly had some noise this year, specifically as it relates to tariffs, not only with the tariffs themselves, but also some of the supply chain countermeasures to address those. Our long-term model that assumes incrementals in that 30% to 35% range. I think low 30s gets us to that 25% in '29. If we're at the upper end of that range, we could do it sooner.

But I would say everything that we see certainly based on Q3 and what we see shaping up for Q4 certainly keeps us on that path. The one variable, and we were very clear with this in both Investor Days is going to be the timing of growth investments, and they're investments. So you invest upfront, you get the return over time. But even with that, we would believe going into any given year, our expectation is to be in that 30% to 35% range. Maybe the one dynamic for next year is we certainly wouldn't anticipate a headwind from tariffs. They continue to remain volatile and uncertain, but that was probably the most significant headwind that got us below that 30% to 35% range in 2025.


Operator

We now have Chris Snyder with Morgan Stanley on the line.


Christopher Snyder
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I wanted to follow up on the prior margin commentary. The one thing that really stood out to me Q2 to Q3 was the sequential margins, operating profit up more than revenue sequentially. So I know margins are swinging around a lot with tariffs and how that's being phased in. But I guess kind of the question is, if we step back, do you think the price conversations or negotiations versus the customers have changed versus a year ago? Specifically, do you think they've gotten any harder? Or is this kind of still the same environment where they're paying for speed of supply and innovation of the technology?


Giordano Albertazzi
CEO & Director

Thank you for the question, Chris. So I'd say that first and foremost, we continue to be focused on and deliver on a price/cost positive type of performance. When it comes to the conversation with the customer, I think we have to be all very, very, very careful in the sense that I don't think we should think about as price conversations ever being easy.

I mean we have a very, very professional, knowledgeable, savvy customers, and they correctly behave as such. So the price that one can achieve is really on the back of the value that is being delivered to our customers. And very commercially savvy, technically savvy customers. I don't see a dramatic change in that respect. What is absolutely critical is really the innovation, but the innovation not in and of itself, but the innovation that enables additional value creation for them, for our customers. It is a service level. It is the quality you bring to the party. We think we're doing a very good job in that respect across all axes. But our customers more or less price sensitive. They're very business sensitive. They've always been very business sensitive. So it's up to us to deliver value to them that enables price to be achieved for us.

Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.


Jeffrey Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Two questions on my mind. I guess I'll ask one actually. Just curious on Europe, actually, your apparent confidence that it does, in fact, get better. The second half of 2026 sounds like a long way away. I mean, you watch in France, I think, is on their fourth government here in 12 months. So just your confidence that they get their act together. Do you actually see a product pipeline coming together there? And maybe just address a little bit, I guess, the restructuring you're doing to prepare for that eventual growth that you're expecting?


Giordano Albertazzi
CEO & Director

Sure. Well, Jeff, thanks a lot. So I probably have been more sanguine about the Europe reacceleration in the past that I've been now. So saying it is going to be a year from now -- I mean, a year from now when we sit around the same table and phone summarizing our '26 -- Q3 2026 performance. That means that we are building some wiggle room there for things to really come back. And I truly believe that they will come back because the market is in a bad need for capacity AI capacity.

And there are very stringent data sovereignty reasons why that capacity for inference needs to be in country, in region, in the EU or in the U.K., et cetera. So vacancy rates are extremely, extremely low. And oh, by the way, new technology data center design need to be built. Pipelines are encouraging in terms of the total size of the pipeline. But what I see different is there is a certain vibrancy in the conversation with customers that was not there to the same extent.

So one of the things I said in the past to say, hey, the people, our customers have many open fronts and the American front is so demanding that it's absorbing them a lot. While that continues to be the case, I think that they are making headroom, if you will, or, let's say, that dedicating to a few more brain cycles to the rest of the world and Europe is certainly one of those.

We are positive also about the Middle East landscape from a market standpoint. We will not go into the details of the restructuring for obvious reasons. But rest assured that it means making sure that as the markets accelerate in the direction of AI infrastructure build-out, we want to have an organization that from a delivery and execution and also go-to-market standpoint is exactly tailored to that. So I want to make sure that we do not miss any opportunity and certainly are agile enough for reacceleration. But I will not go too much into detail.


Operator

We now have Andrew Obin with Bank of America.


Andrew Obin
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just a question on services. It seems services is part of your moat being the industry leader. As you're gaining the strong equipment orders, could you just comment on your investment in services and specifically any KPIs you can give us on headcount? How are you scaling up your support function to keep up with the top line?


Giordano Albertazzi
CEO & Director

Yes. Well, certainly, those big orders and any orders in general infrastructure requires a service for sometimes installation, not always. But certainly, all the time, very often project management and commissioning and start-up. So very, very important. I agree with you that is a moat or as we like to call it, super power. When it comes to the headcount, we were talking about north of 4,000 engineers globally. I think we were on north of 4,400. So -- there we go. We are certainly accelerating and continue to invest.

The way we approach that is really when we do our SIOP for product demand, on the back of that, there is a SIOP for services. And SIOP for services has also a geographic dimension by which we have to understand where our backlog will land and where we will need to increase capacity. So it's, of course, much more disposed than the manufacturing capacity for obvious reasons, but they are all dimensions that we are taking into consideration. So if you think about that, call it, about 4,400, 4,500 field engineers, we expect that to continue to expand.

By the way, just like we talk about productivity in the manufacturing environment, there is productivity in the service environment. So we really look at services from a way we run it in terms of distributed supply chain, distributed factory. So we are very rigorous in terms of how we measure the performance in terms of the service level, in terms of time it takes to be on site relative to our contractual commitments, et cetera. Very, very, very experienced, mature and paranoid about our service level in field.


Operator

We now have Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.


Andrew Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Geo, can you give us a little more color into your capacity investments that you talked about that you're making, particularly in North America? You mentioned you're increasing R&D by 20% plus, but how do we think about CapEx growth in '26? And will you have enough capacity to keep up with your current backlog growth of 30% with the assumption that your revenue growth may not slow much, if at all, from, I think, high 20s this year?


Giordano Albertazzi
CEO & Director

So we will not be explicit when it comes to CapEx in 2026, Andy. But clearly, as usual, there are 2 things at play. One is more footprint and CapEx. The other is productivity and Vertiv operating system. So let's not get the second part because to us, it's very, very, very confident, but you're right. I mean the -- clearly, with the backlog expanding with the comments that I made, very encouraging comments on the pipelines, we clearly are expanding our capacity, and that's particularly true in North America.

The expansion, as we have said in other occasions, is predominantly expansion of existing sites. That's something that we like a lot in terms of the speed that it enables from the decision to having that capacity available and the ability to scale very experienced teams that are already running Vertiv plant. So that will continue. That is our philosophy. I don't rule out, of course, brand-new locations.

But in general, what we do and what we do well is grow the footprint 6 to 12 months ahead of when the footprint is needed. Now I think we do a very, very good job, never perfect. It's never perfect. There's always multiple product lines, multiple regions, but we're pretty satisfied with the direction of travel. And we believe it will well sustain our future trajectory. That's nothing else, Andy, that I can add.


Operator

We now have Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research on the line.


Nigel Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

I want to go back to margins. Obviously, a very impressive outcome in 3Q. Maybe, David, give us an update on sort of where we are on this plant reconfiguration, which I think was meant to be completed by the end of the year. And just on the 4Q margins, specifically, you did, I think, take it down by about maybe 1 point versus the original -- what was embedded in the 4Q plan.

Just wondering if that's tariff inflation, some of these secondary tariffs or whether there's an EMEA mix there? And I know I'm rambling a bit here. Can I just clarify the points about 2026 incrementals? Because tariff mitigation, maybe -- yes, do we think '26 can be above -- sorry, do we think '26 can be above the bar in terms of that incremental margin guidance?


David Fallon
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I would say you weren't rambling until the last 5 to 10 seconds. But I think all your questions are very much linked together. But looking at Q4 margins, we did take those down versus prior guidance about 100 basis points, as you mentioned. I would say half of that on the contribution margin side and certainly driven by the incremental tariffs that we saw post earnings last time.

In addition, and we're very proud of our operating leverage, but we're not afraid to invest in fixed costs. And we are planning to accelerate fixed cost investment into Q4 that were previously planned in the first half of next year. So if you put those 2 together, it's probably half related to contribution margin with tariffs and the other half related to operating leverage. And if you look at margins sequentially, relatively flat Q3 to Q4. Once again, we see benefit as it relates to addressing the operational challenges, but we do have the additional tariff headwinds.

Your question related to incrementals for 2026, probably premature to provide any specific numbers. But once again, we'll reiterate, we expect to be in that 30% to 35% range in any given year over the next 3 to 5 years that the 25% target is pertinent.

We're still evaluating the impact of tariffs, but we do anticipate to materially offset the tariffs that we have line of sight to today with countermeasures we're enacting with both pricing and also transitioning the supply chain. We expect to be materially offset exiting Q1, which would imply certainly, tariffs not being a headwind year-over-year.

And despite uncertainty, we would expect that actually to be somewhat of a tailwind. So once again, too soon to give any specific numbers as it relates to incrementals. But if you backtrack a year, there's nothing in particular that we're looking at, at 2026 that would be different than any other year as it pertains to incrementals.


Operator

We now have a question from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.


Nicole DeBlase
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

So I just wanted to ask on EMEA margins. I think, David, in the opening remarks, you kind of shared confidence that 3Q was kind of the low watermark for EMEA margins. So what is the path back to mid-20s? Can we get there without volume growth driven by what you're doing on restructuring? Or do we really need volumes to come back to kind of get back to where margins were within EMEA?


David Fallon
Chief Financial Officer

I would say a combination of both. And we did mention that we do anticipate, number one, a sales acceleration in EMEA in Q4. I think I mentioned in my comments, up mid-teens. That certainly facilitates improved operating leverage versus Q3. And I would say, overall that we do anticipate margins in Q4 in EMEA to be significantly higher than what we saw in Q3, including addressing operational inefficiencies.

So when we talk about the operational inefficiencies as we put in place to address some of the tariffs, we have a global supply chain and a lot of those actions have been put in place to address those inefficiencies in EMEA. And we would start to certainly see some definitive impact in Q4.


Operator

We now have a question from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.


Mark Delaney
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I was hoping to circle back to the order and pipeline topic. Gio, I think you said in your remarks that the backlog phasing is within typical levels for Vertiv at this point. And I think that implies backlog that is project related would typically be for shipments that are up to 12 to 18 months forward. And so when I take that comment on the phasing of your backlog, it would seem to imply that most of these bigger data center announcements that have come out in recent months and are often for projects that are over the next many years have not yet been fully booked by Vertiv. So one, is that right? And two, is that what's underpinning some of your comments about the pipeline being healthy?


Giordano Albertazzi
CEO & Director

Let me elaborate a little bit on this, Mark. Thank you for the question. So when we talk about the phasing of the backlog is if you take a snapshot now of the $9.5 billion backlog and you look at what is in the 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, whatever, and you look at the same picture for the backlog a year ago, you will see pretty much a similar shape, clearly bigger, 30% bigger, but similar shape. That means that our backlog has not grown by virtue of, let's say, elongation or overstretching. So that's good for us.

We believe that, that is good because that represents the way the industry works. Now clearly, we have seen a lot of very strong, very credible announcement and projects. And one would expect Vertiv to be involved in many of those. And that would probably be a very reasonable expectation, let's put it this way. But those projects are then deployed in phases.

And if we go back to our pretty maniacal -- let's say, sticking to -- maniacally sticking to the rule of only a PO is legally binding PO constitute backlog, then you'll see that, that backlog pretty much mimics the way and the speed at which deployments occur. So in that respect, there's certainly a lot of the more that will be done to fulfill those announcements in our pipeline. And as those projects mature, as those projects mature in terms they are ready for deployment, maybe the next 250 megawatts in a 1 gigawatt deployment, that's the time when orders start to flow in for the likes of us and hopefully for us. Hopefully, that addresses your question, Mark.


Operator

We now have Michael Elias with TD Securities.


Michael Elias
TD Cowen, Research Division

So Gio, on the ground, I'm seeing a massive acceleration in data center demand. I think in the third quarter, data run rate, data center demand is up close to 4x. So it's great to see you guys investing in production capacity. My question for you is that as you think about adding production capacity, could you help us understand from when you make the decision to expand capacity, how long does it take to have the first unit come off the line in that new production capacity? And as part of that, what's the earliest that you could book into that new production capacity? I only ask because I think you're going to need the equipment in a hurry.


Giordano Albertazzi
CEO & Director

Well, Mike, first of all, thank you for the question. We like the reinforcement about the market trajectory. We wholeheartedly agree on a very, very strong market. To the point of capacity, I wouldn't say I would -- there is one answer to that. A lot of our capacity expansion is used more, use that 25%, 30% of capacity that we have latent in the way we build things. If you think about our capacity build-out, do not please think of it in aggregate as one discrete step happening sometimes. That's been going on forever.

We continue to expand what we're saying expansion rate will accelerate, but expansion has always been going on. It depends, again, the time to first unit, let's say, the time to revenue for new capacity is -- it can vary from a few months for a line reconfiguration like 3, 4, 5 months to maybe 12 months for larger expansion that require building from scratch. But again, one thing that we like a lot, and that's why we like a lot is that if we just expand existing facilities, that is really the -- just a technical time to have the new equipment available.

But we have the systems, the people, the leadership, all ready to go and really expanding their volume of business, a lot of scale and a lot of speed. So think about something that can go from a few months to maybe a 9 to 15 months window. So we, of course, build on our backlog, but also on the visibility that we have in a pipeline. Hopefully, addressing your question, Mike.


Operator

We now have Amit Mehrotra with UBS.


Amit Mehrotra
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Gio, I wanted to maybe ask you to address the competitive environment across all your products. And the only reason I ask that, it seems like every 3 or 4 months, there's some announcement or some innovation that gets everybody to question the entire thesis around Vertiv's position in the market. There was obviously AWS In-Row Heat Exchanger, a few months ago, recently Microsoft, microfluidics and people are talking about 800-volt DC eliminating the need for PSUs.

Maybe address all of those, if you don't mind, obviously, not AWS, just microfluidics and the 800-volt DC dynamic and kind of how your content is evolving against that $3 million per megawatt? And maybe what your message is to folks when they -- on the receiving end of these innovations every 3 or 4 months that causes them to question the entire thesis.


Giordano Albertazzi
CEO & Director

Well, we will use the next 2 hours, [indiscernible] for this. This is a great question. But I'll try to be super concise here. We love the innovation intensity in the industry. We love it because we are at the center of it. If anything, we drive it. And that's exactly -- we go back to one of the questions we had, how to make sure that the price equation, I think it was Chris, the price equation stays favorable. That's exactly what innovation does.

And being ahead in the innovation curve enables us to continue down that path. So very important. That's why we relentlessly invest more and more in innovation. That's why we nurture our relationships so intensely, as you know, we do. When it comes to specific examples, take microfluidics, take 800-volt DC, different stories. For example, take microfluidics and you say, oh, if anything, this is exactly direct-to-chip -- direct-to-chip liquid cooling just done with other means than a cold plate. It preserve everything thermal chain versus the thermal chain absolutely intact, if anything.

You would have probably smaller micro channels and more pressure drop and more cleanliness needs in the system. So let's not be afraid of innovation. Innovation is absolutely our friend. Our friend certainly is the 800-volt DC, leveraging our decades-long DC power and AC power experience in DC Power specifically. So being at the forefront as our Page 12, I think it was explained at the forefront of it is a competitive advantage.

When we think about our TAM per megawatt, we start to see really a range that goes from 3 to 3.5 megawatts -- sorry, million per megawatt. So if you will, narrowing a little bit on the upper end of the spectrum that we have given you in the past. And that's a good thing. Again, it's because of the technology. Clearly, the industry is becoming more interesting to many players.

But also we think a better -- we see a better delineation of the competitive landscape. If we compare, for example, everything thermal and liquid cooling now compared to what it was a year and 1.5 years ago. So that is in the direction of more consolidated, more rational players, not bad. And again, we continue to hold true to our competitive advantages and reinforce them, service, innovation, ability to scale, all the things that you heard from us. So absolutely intact. If anything, we love this environment, this innovation-intense environment.

This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back over to Gio Albertazzi for any closing remarks.


Giordano Albertazzi
CEO & Director

Brika, thanks a lot, and thanks, everyone, for your questions and time today. But before I wrap up, I want to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to David Fallon, our CFO, who will be retiring. So it's been kind of 12 earnings calls together, probably 12 plus 1. I was kind of a semi in the role. So a big thank you. David has been instrumental in our success, bringing great financial leadership and strategic insight during a period of significant well, transformation and acceleration and growth.

So David, thank you wholeheartedly for your partnership and for your dedication. I'm absolutely excited to welcome Craig Chamberlin as our incoming CFO. Craig brings strong experience and capabilities that will help drive Vertiv's next phase of growth. I couldn't be more excited about our future. We continue to demonstrate our ability to execute and adapt in an ever-evolving market.

While our progress has been strong, we stay focused on doing more. Opportunities ahead are extraordinary. With our technology leadership, global scale and deep customer partnership, Vertiv is uniquely positioned for the future. A big thank you to team Vertiv constantly focused on delivering value for our customers and investors. And with that, thank you, and have a great rest of your day.
