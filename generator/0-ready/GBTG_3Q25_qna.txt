Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions]. First question comes from Lee Horowitz with Deutsche Bank.

Lee Horowitz
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Two if I could. Maybe as it relates to your 2026 outlook, I wonder what you're hearing from your customers in terms of their expectations on what the big beautiful bill could mean for corporate spending broadly and how that perhaps informs your preliminary outlook?

And then maybe one on the new SAP Concur relationship strikes is quite interesting. I wonder how you're thinking these tools may serve to help unlock the unmanaged segment in SME more greatly so that we could see that part of your business continue to come online and take share there.

Paul Abbott
CEO & Director

Well, thanks, Lee. Thanks for the questions. First of all, in terms of the outlook for 2026, the most recent survey that we did, showed either the same or moderate improvements in terms of the travel budgets for 2026. So I would say we're cautiously optimistic about a slight uptick in organic growth in 2026. We're also seeing a noticeable increase in the number of Meetings and Events. I know I've mentioned before, Lee, that that's an area of our business where we get a longer-term view given the booking patterns for Meetings and Events.

And in the last quarter, we've actually seen a double-digit increase in the number of forward bookings for Meetings and Events into 2026. So again, that's an encouraging sign as well. So we'll provide more details on the '26 outlook when we give formal guidance in February. But I would say that we are cautiously optimistic about a moderate improvement in organic growth in 2026.

Yes, on the SAP Concur partnership, I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks that 80% of the SAP customer base are actually SME customers and we have over 100 million users. And so with this new flagship solution that we are co-developing with SAP Concur, we will have the ability to market that solution into the SAP customer base, which obviously, as I said, a very, very large established SME customer base. So we do think that, that's going to really help us to accelerate SME growth.

And then secondly, Egencia has been our primary product for bringing customers in within the SME segment and also more specifically the unmanaged segment and the ability to integrate now Egencia into Concur Expense, so that it becomes a seamless all-in-one travel and expense solution for those 100 million users is also a significant step forward in terms of our value proposition in that segment. So both those developments should help us to accelerate our SME new wins in 2026 and beyond.

We now turn to Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercose ISI.

Duane Pfennigwerth
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

You touched on it with your comments just now. But can you comment maybe just on where we are in the underlying macro for business travel? We were having a pretty vigorous recovery in the U.S. off of the tariff shocks into the government shutdown. Now it appears the clouds are maybe parting on that front. How would you characterize business travel demand trends now versus maybe the lows of this year back in April or May, and I'm not sure if you agree with that as a trough period.

Paul Abbott
CEO & Director

Yes. I think we said last quarter that we were expecting to see an improvement in demand into Q3, and that's frankly exactly what we saw. And you see that in the numbers that we've just shared. If you look at our sort of guide for Q4, we're also expecting to see some improvement in the organic growth rate into Q4. So I think what we signaled last quarter in terms of an improvement in the demand environment is exactly what we have seen.

Duane Pfennigwerth
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then on CWT, obviously, you're acquiring customers, a deeper presence in some industries and a significant synergy opportunity. But I wonder if you could just remind us, is there anything on the technology front or on the software front where you feel like they may have had a relative advantage?

Paul Abbott
CEO & Director

I think there are some areas of the business, particularly in the hotel space and also some of the traveler care, travel counselor tools that we are looking at that we think are interesting and that may help us to create more value for customers and also help us to improve productivity in our servicing teams.

But when you look at the software solutions, obviously, the main software solutions that we will be going to market with, will be the Egencia solution, which, of course, now will have full integration into SAP Concur Expense, the Neo suite of solutions and of course, now the flagship product that we are developing with SAP Concur, which is complete, which again will be an integrated travel and expense solution. So those will remain the 3 core software solutions in addition to, of course, third-party software that we integrate with as well.

Duane Pfennigwerth
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And then just on Concur, I'll sneak one more in. Sorry about that. Just on Concur, obviously, you've worked with Concur for some time. Can you just maybe highlight what is different now about this partnership?

Paul Abbott
CEO & Director

Yes, sure. So I think what's different about this is that we are now actually co-developing a new flagship solution that will lead the industry for travel and expense. We have teams that are working together to fully integrate the solutions. And that is going to mean improved content for customers. It's going to mean improved savings for customers, and it's without question, going to be an improved experience. We're bringing the expertise of both teams together in travel and expense to create a more integrated experience for the user. That experience will be AI-powered. It will be more integrated across travel and expense. There will be one app essentially for everything.

And there will be an improved [ UX and improved ] retailing experience for both travel and expense. So those are the key changes that customers can expect going forward on the Complete product. And then, of course, what's also new is Egencia will have that integration into Concur Expense.

Our Egencia customers really likes the user experience on Egencia, the content, the AI-powered experience. But some customers that are operating in that SAP environment want full integration into SAP Concur Expense, and that's what we're going to give them going forward.

We now turn to James Goodall with Rothschild and Co-Redburn.

James Goodall
Rothschild & Co Redburn, Research Division

So firstly, just coming back to the SAP Complete and Egencia T&E solutions. What are the key metrics or milestones that you'll be watching and hoping to achieve as these products roll out to the market?

Paul Abbott
CEO & Director

I am sorry, would you repeat the question? I think we lost you at the beginning.

James Goodall
Rothschild & Co Redburn, Research Division

Sorry, sorry. So just coming back to the SAP Complete and Egencia T&E solution. What are the key metrics or milestones that you guys are going to be watching and hoping to achieve as these products roll out to the market?

Paul Abbott
CEO & Director

Yes. I think what we're expecting, frankly, from the new strategic alliance with SAP is to accelerate our growth. And we're going to have a flagship product that gives us competitive advantage. And therefore, we're expecting that to accelerate the growth of our business. We're obviously going to be cross-selling both the Complete product and the Egencia product into the SAP customer base. So again, we'll be looking for increased growth.

We'll also be looking for improved customer retention because we're going to be able to deliver customers with a better experience. We're also going to be bringing more content to customers and more savings. So looking at the savings that we're delivering to customers as well, will be an important metric to track.

And then, of course, it tracks very much to the overall digitization of the business and continuing to increase the share of digital transactions, which we referenced in the presentation is now at 82%. And obviously, we expect that metric to continue to grow. And that ultimately feeds into improved gross margin and overall margin expansion for the business. So those are the key metrics that you should expect us to track and report.

James Goodall
Rothschild & Co Redburn, Research Division

Great. And then just secondly, just thinking about the synergy number of $155 million. I mean that number hasn't now changed for 2 years, I guess, since you first almost 2 years since you outlined the acquisition. But now that you've got a bit more under the numbers with CWT, I mean, do you see any potential for incremental synergies to be unlocked, whether that's incremental cost savings or revenue synergies as well?

Paul Abbott
CEO & Director

Well, I think what we've been able to do really post close is to obviously pressure test that synergy number in more detail. And when you own and operate the business, you have the ability to do that. And so we now have just a very high confidence level of delivering that $155 million of synergies. That, just as a reminder, is 100% cost synergies. So that is a net cost synergy number.

There, of course, can be opportunities to increase revenues, and we're certainly looking to cross-sell our products and services into the CWT customer base, but we have not baked any of those revenue synergies into our business case or our outlook. But we absolutely have a very high confidence level on $155 million of synergies. And as Karen mentioned in her remarks, $55 million of that, we already have been able to identify an action. And of course, $100 million in additions still ahead of us.

[Operator Instructions]. We now turn to Stephen Ju with UBS.

Stephen Ju
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So on the Egencia TTV disclosure, I think, trailing 12 months of about $8 billion, has this segment more or less recovered back to the pre-pandemic levels? And I think secondarily, at the same time, the $8 billion of TTV is on potentially an addressable market of $800 billion plus. I mean that's just 1% of the market. So availability of online and software solutions for travel is something that's probably not lost on anybody. So I mean, between Egencia and competitors, we're probably still at less than 10% penetration. So what do you think the unlock here is to get the SMBs onboarded and using Egencia?

Paul Abbott
CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Stephen. Good question. And it's worth remembering that Egencia is a very important part of our SME segment, but our SME segment is approximately 50% of our overall SME volume. So our SME volumes are also on other solutions outside of Egencia.

But your point is absolutely correct. There is a significant runway for growth in the SME segment. The investments that we're making in Egencia to evolve that product into a travel and expense solution will obviously, I think, be an opportunity for us to accelerate growth in the SME segment.

If you look at the partnership that we just announced with SAP Concur, that gives us the ability to sell our solutions into that SAP customer base that I mentioned earlier. So we expect both of those developments to help us accelerate growth. But look, your point is absolutely valid. There is a huge opportunity to grow in what is still a very, very large and very fragmented segment.

Stephen Ju
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. And secondarily, I get that there's probably a relatively higher failure rate among SMEs, but has Egencia and indeed your entire portfolio now, has there been any signs that you've been able to hold on to some of these SMEs as they grow and continue to become bigger companies?

Paul Abbott
CEO & Director

Yes, absolutely. You're right, there is more churn in the SME customer base. Our retention is around 94% in SME versus global multinational is around 98%, which obviously brings us to our average, which has been tracking around 95%, 96%. So you're always going to have more churn within the SME customer base. But our retention rates are very high. And I think what we did see at the back end of last year and the beginning of this year is we did see some softening in the organic performance, the same-store sales in SME. And I think it's been well documented that, that's driven primarily by macroeconomic conditions.

And I'm pleased to say that we have seen a steady improvement in that organic performance as we've gone through 2025. So again, we're cautiously optimistic about Q4 and into 2026, continuing to see an improvement in the organic performance, but also the investments we're making in our sales and marketing channels, plus the investments we're making in Complete and the investments in Egencia set us up to accelerate our growth in the SME segment.

We now turn to Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.

Toni Kaplan
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And thanks for your comments on the AI stuff in the prepared remarks. We've been seeing some new platforms in the space. And we're wondering where do you see the place for sort of those platforms in the market versus -- and I know that you have AI embedded in yours as well. But do you expect that the AI platforms will be more sort of targeted in the SME part of the market? And what type of customer would benefit from using a platform that is like essentially AI forward versus Egencia, for example?

Paul Abbott
CEO & Director

Well, I think what's really exciting about where we are now on AI and our digitization program is that we're seeing real results, both in terms of revenue performance and cost performance, and I referenced some of those results in my prepared remarks. We're seeing an impact to revenue and conversion through the AI-enabled features that we have in Egencia.

We're also seeing cost reduction from the AI solutions that we're implementing across our servicing channels. And so I think AI is very much a tailwind for us in both improving revenue and conversion, improving the customer experience and also taking cost out of the business. And as I said, I think we are starting to see results and real P&L impact on both fronts.

In terms of how the broader competitive environment is going to evolve, we are already developing our own Agentic AI capabilities and also working with third-party Agentic solutions, and what we're seeing is that Agentic AI is definitely going to start to become an important channel. But it's going to be one of, I think, many channels that customers use, and they're going to want Agentic AI to be integrated into whether it's chat, whether it's voice and all of the other channels that those customers use to interact with us. And it's going to be important for all of those channels to make sure that they are connected up to the same marketplace and the same content, the same traveler data and traveler preferences, the same company data and company policy data.

And what we're finding is that the fact that we essentially orchestrate all of that end-to-end, and we are the ones that actually hold and manage all of that data that it's actually our technology stack and data that is incredibly important in order to actually make that Agentic experience work, whether it's our Agentic AI experience or third-party Agentic AI.

So I think you're going to see it grow as a channel. I think you're going to see many different versions of Agentic AI that are powering that channel. But I think you're going to see that effectively all integrate into the technology stack and data that we have, so that customers have a fully integrated and entirely consistent experience across all channels.

Toni Kaplan
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. And just thinking about -- you shared preliminary expectations for 2026. The adjusted EBITDA growth there, are you embedding cost savings from AI in that number? And could you actually do better than that? It's a nice number, but can you do better than that if you are able to find even more AI efficiencies next year?

Karen Williams
Chief Financial Officer

So thanks for the question, Toni. We've given the preliminary expectations based upon what we see today. And there is margin improvement along with obviously then the synergies embedded in them that we've mentioned from a CWT perspective. So it is based upon everything that we feel confident about at this point.
