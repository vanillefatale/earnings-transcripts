Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Kelly Motta with KBW.

Kelly Motta
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Maybe kicking it off on deposits. I appreciate the updated margin guidance -- or the new margin guidance for 2026. It looks like you did a pretty nice job lowering interest-bearing deposit costs here. Can you speak more in terms of what you're assuming for deposit betas embedded in that NIM outlook here? And just any market commentary as to the level of competitiveness now at this stage.

Heng Chen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. I think we're assuming deposit betas in the 60% range or so. And in terms of market competition, I think it's about the same. Yes, we haven't -- it's pretty rational in Q4.

Chang Liu
CEO, President & Director

So Kelly, kind of for me looking forward for 2026, I think the local L.A. and New York landscape is still pretty competitive. I mean we have about nearly $4 billion of maturing CDs in the first quarter with an average yield of about 3.8%. We'll run our -- the Lunar New Year campaign and likely if we can price somewhat below that, that's kind of the goal, but we're going to be sensitive about defending that base that we have, while we try to transition some of that into noninterest-bearing.

Kelly Motta
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And just a point of clarification on that beta hang that 60%, is that for interest-bearing or total deposits?

Heng Chen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Interest bearing.

Kelly Motta
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then maybe on -- it was nice to see the NPA improvement, and it seems like you had both a payoff and a resolution there. As we kind of look ahead, what are you seeing in terms of credit and any migration into criticized and overall trends?

Chang Liu
CEO, President & Director

So maybe some of that I can help with this is some of the migrations into special mention, we don't see any particular trends in particular, 3 of the 5 that we were talking about the top 3, they're different in their own nature. One, for example, is a project in New York. It's a mixed-use project. It's completed. It's fully occupied. The ownership is just waiting for a lower property tax status approval to get through. And once that status approval gets through, then they'll be back up to compliance with sort of the debt coverage with that one.

Another one is a multifamily mixed use, primarily in the Pacific Northwest. They have a new commercial tenant coming in, not quite there yet. And so that's contributing to the -- not being able to meet the covenant requirement and as well as some of the more competition in the area. So it's -- they're finding some more challenges, but they're going to return that back to stabilization and it's got a great guarantor support and they're paying us as agreed. And then lastly, it's a bit of a C&I story, and it's a distributor of exercise equipment and their own warehouse and they got some quarterly -- not being able to meet the quarterly financial requirements. But overall, for the year, they're expecting a full year on a positive note.

So once we get the CPA financials, we hope to be able to upgrade that if they can show a full year profit.

[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Andrew Terrell with Stephens.

Andrew Terrell
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Maybe just on the margin quickly. The loan yield performance this quarter was also a decent amount better than I kind of was expecting. Was there any level of interest recovery in the loan yields this quarter, just looking at some of the NPL reduction?

Heng Chen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. It was 5 basis points to the NIM versus 4 basis points in Q3.

Andrew Terrell
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Got it. Okay. So relatively close to the baseline amount?

Heng Chen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Right, yes.

Andrew Terrell
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Okay. And I appreciate all the color on the deposit and kind of cost dynamics in the market right now. What about on the lending side? Have you seen an elevated level of competition for incremental loan growth? And just what's the kind of status of the market on the lending side?

Chang Liu
CEO, President & Director

Yes. So surprisingly, I looked at those numbers for 3 segments. On the residential mortgage, believe it or not, we had a pretty strong growth last year in '25 and the rates of the entire portfolio actually held up pretty nicely. As a matter of fact, I think improved by a couple of bps there. On the CRE side, I think there's still pretty strong competition for the right type of assets and loans. So that declined by, don't quote me on this, about 15, 20 bps on the entire portfolio there. I think the most amount of competition we saw probably was on the C&I side. I think the C&I side, we're still trying to push for growth and find some new lenders, new relationship kind of teams and those kind of things. But our existing portfolio on the C&I side, that we saw probably the most amount of competition there, and that rate declined steeper than the other 2 segments.

Andrew Terrell
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Got it. Okay. If I could just sneak one more in. Do you have the amount of the expected amortization in 2026?

Heng Chen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

For low income housing, it's probably $11 million a quarter, Andrew.
