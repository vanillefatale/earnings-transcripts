Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Seth Seifman at JPMorgan.

Seth Seifman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I wanted to start off asking maybe about aerospace profitability and if you think about the margin path from here through the [ phase of ] transition to 700 and 800 and 600 [indiscernible] away. There's some market expense for this year...

Phebe Novakovic
Chairperson & CEO

Seth, you're breaking up a bit. Are you asking about margins...

Seth Seifman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. Sorry, can you hear me a little bit better now?

Phebe Novakovic
Chairperson & CEO

Yes, that's better. Thank you. If you can say it again because we got every other word.

Seth Seifman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Cool. Aerospace profitability, I guess, now that we're through the product transitions, there's some improvement expected in '26 here, but I think the hope is that those margins become more robust. And so how do you think about getting there? And is it the supply chain that's the chief impediment as we're seeing in some other places as well? And what are the plans to mitigate that?

Danny Deep
President

Yes, I can take that. This is Danny here. Yes, look, we think margins are going to continue to improve. As you said, we're up about 70 basis points in '26 versus '24. I think we'll see some improved pricing, improved efficiency, some lower overheads and some lower research and development costs. So that will be helpful.

I think right now, we have headwinds around tariffs. Some of the cost increases that we've incurred in the supply chain happened before we're able to reflect them in our increased pricing. And we do have the opportunity to increase pricing, but that's often in periods subsequent to when the cost increase has been incurred from the supply chain, but we continue to expect improvement there.

Seth Seifman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Right. Okay. Okay. Great. And then maybe if you can update us on your expectations for future submarine contracts for both Columbia and Virginia, that would be great in terms of maybe timing and in terms of how they are different than in the past.

Phebe Novakovic
Chairperson & CEO

So to be quite honest, we don't know. We know that both of those contracts are out there. The demand is there, and it's simply up to the government when they come to us. So we don't know very much. But when we do, we'll tell you.

Operator

We'll move next to Doug Harned at Bernstein.

Douglas Harned
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

Staying on Marine. The revenues look great. The -- clearly, it appears your throughput is going way up. The Navy has been pushing so long to get throughput up, get back -- get to the 2 Virginia class per year rate. And how would you describe Marine now in terms of kind of closing that gap on where the Navy ultimately wants to be here, given that you've got so much money in the budget right now?

Phebe Novakovic
Chairperson & CEO

So I'd say we are continuing to improve efficiency, retention at Electric Boat. Our throughput, as you know, is up and proficiency is really key as is retention. The supply chain remains the gating item. And we have seen significant improvement in some areas, but we still have some suppliers and parts of the supply chain that are at risk.

The government has been heavily investing in the supply chain, which is why we've seen some improvement, but we need to focus and do more, particularly with respect to sole source suppliers where they are bottlenecks.

So as the supply chain begins to improve and increase their productivity -- and by the way, the quality still remains high. It's not an issue. It's simply really about the constraints that they have in capacity and getting their throughput up. But once they do, that will improve -- that will be the next big step in improving our productivity and throughput and the ability to further accelerate deliveries to the customer.

Douglas Harned
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

And then on combat, I mean the backlog story was really strong. And clearly, European demand is very high. And our assumption would be that, that kind of demand growth would continue. When you look at the scale of the backlog increase you're seeing there, how long will it take? Or what are your expectations in the ability to convert that to revenue growth over time?

Phebe Novakovic
Chairperson & CEO

So we'll see some increase in revenue growth this year and accelerating into '27 when we begin to move into production of some of these programs in Europe. This year will be largely planning and engineering R&D work and then as we move into production. So we have a pretty smooth path. We believe, to transition from our engineering work into production. And now we've got the resources, property, plant and equipment personnel to execute.

Operator

We'll go next to Gautam Khanna at TD Cowen.

Gautam Khanna
TD Cowen, Research Division

Dan, you made a reference to a tariff impact at Gulfstream at Aero. I was wondering how much you guys absorbed in '25? And what are you expecting in '26, if you could frame that for us and...

Danny Deep
President

Yes. Sure. So the impact of tariffs in 2025 was $41 million. But let me help you a little bit with tariff as best as I can. So there's a cash outlay when the tariff is imposed when the material is coming into the country. And -- but the cost to earnings happens at a different point. As you know, we recognize revenue and earnings when we actually deliver the plane, and that's also when we recognize the tariff impact.

And so there's an other element where how much of that can we get back in terms of some sort of reimbursement, and that's difficult to predict. So the tariffs that we are going to see in 2026 are largely based on cash that we expended in 2025. It will be higher than in 2025, so higher than the $41 million, but those tariffs are contemplated in our 2026 margins.

Gautam Khanna
TD Cowen, Research Division

Got you. That's helpful. And if we could just shift to Marine, the increase in 18% sequentially. How much is that at the yard itself in terms of productivity versus in the supply chain? Because historically, you guys have called out the supply chain kind of being a constraint. I'm just wondering how that has improved relative to before.

Danny Deep
President

Yes. Look, I mean, I don't know how to apportion both of those impacts, but they're both impactful on the margins. I think as Phebe said, when we get the supply chain operating at a full cadence and at full efficiency, that will have an impact on margins.

And then equally so, our own productivity and focus on execution as we continue to improve and we're on that path, we should expect to see improvements in margins. And we think those improvements will be durable and steady as you've seen from 2024 to 2025, we'll see continued strength there and increases.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Scott Deuschle at Deutsche Bank.

Scott Deuschle
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Kim, can you walk us through what drives free cash flow conversion to the 100% range in '26 despite the big step-up in CapEx?

Kimberly Kuryea
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, sure. So we're really looking at basically strong operating performance out of the business units, and that's the major driver. Obviously, we are increasing CapEx to a significant extent, but that's factored in. And we -- our goal is to be at 100%, and that's what we're targeting for 2026 and quite frankly, into the next couple of years.

Scott Deuschle
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And just to clarify, is the Navy offering some working capital support for the Navy CapEx?

Phebe Novakovic
Chairperson & CEO

Not at this point. Not to our knowledge.

Scott Deuschle
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And then, Danny, given the strong orders and demand at Gulfstream as well as the strength on the production and supply chain side, I guess, why wouldn't the delivery growth in 2026 be higher than this 1% increase? To ask another way, what's the limiting factor on delivery growth at Gulfstream?

Phebe Novakovic
Chairperson & CEO

So, let me take that on. We have provided you with the deliveries that we are quite comfortable at the moment that we can execute. Completion, final test delivery tend to be the long poles in the tent, but we are working to expand our completion capacity through increased efficiency and where necessary, additional tooling and fixtures.

But let's just put this in some perspective. In '24, we had a 30.5% increase in revenues. And from -- in '25, we had a 16.5%. That's in the hard-to-do category. So what we're doing right now is working to absorb that growth while increasing margins. So we believe this is a prudent plan. It's focused on meeting our obligations to our customers and expanding our productivity.

Operator

We'll move next to Sheila Kahyaoglu at Jefferies.

Sheila Kahyaoglu
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great quarter. Maybe just on your last comments, given we're on aviation, the order momentum has been super. Can you talk a little bit about what's driving that, maybe by geography? Was it bonus depreciation? Or is it the new model introductions you have going in?

Phebe Novakovic
Chairperson & CEO

I think a number of factors have driven the increased demand. Certainly, our new products have. The 800 led the demand, followed by the 700 and the 600. I suspect bonus depreciation was a factor as is the strength of various economies. I would also tell you that the pipeline is active and growing, and we have good activity. So we like what we see on the demand side.

Sheila Kahyaoglu
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. And if I could follow up maybe on the capital deployment comments. How do we think about GD Combat and what's going on there? There's been a lot of press about capacity in munitions and [ FMO ]. How are you thinking about capacity coming online for Combat and how that factors into the 3.5% of CapEx to sales ratio over the next few years?

Phebe Novakovic
Chairperson & CEO

So the majority of or half at least of the CapEx for this coming year is at Electric Boat. We have been investing in Combat Systems across the portfolio, and we'll continue to do so.

On the munition side, we have capacity and have executed that capacity up in Northeast Pennsylvania at 36 rounds a month for the last 12 months. We've increased the load pack and established a load pack and assembly facility and with the capacity of 50,000 rounds a month. And we've increased our propellant capacity. So all in all, we are -- we see some instances of need for additional investment, and we'll make that accordingly.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Matt Akers at BNP.

Matthew Akers
BNP Paribas, Research Division

I guess, Phebe, historically, you guys have usually guided ex capital deployment, and I think probably a lot of us just go ahead and stick it in our models anyway. But just I guess, given some of the pressure we've seen on the industry on buybacks, I guess could you comment on maybe whether we should be a little bit more cautious on assuming that this year?

Phebe Novakovic
Chairperson & CEO

So our capital deployment strategy for the last number of years has been to continue to invest in our growing business. That's resulted in increased backlog. So we think we believe and plan on additional investments in our portfolio to ensure that we're able to efficiently execute that backlog and provide for the demands and needs of our customer.

We have -- let's -- on the dividend, we paid a dividend for over 25 years. And every year in March, the Board decides the extent of any increase, but we're committed to the dividend, and we never comment on share repurchase. I'd note that it's not particularly popular right now. So our habit and pension for not commenting on share repurchases, I believe appropriate. But I think it's -- our strategy remains heavily invest in the business because it's justified given the demand and the backlog.

Matthew Akers
BNP Paribas, Research Division

Got it. And then I guess just one more on kind of the CapEx with the step this year, I mean should we think of this as kind of a multiyear investment that needs to be made? Or is this more something that will kind of revert to more normalized levels in '27 and beyond?

Phebe Novakovic
Chairperson & CEO

We'll continue to invest year-over-year in our businesses because we have the long-term growth there, and it's embedded in our backlog. We believe that, that's appropriate. So the investments year-over-year in CapEx may vary a bit, but you should expect that strategy going forward.

Operator

We'll move next to Myles Walton at Wolfe Research.

Myles Walton
Wolfe Research, LLC

You've previously given medium-term margin expansion sort of color for Aerospace. I was curious if you could maybe update those margin outlook targets.

Phebe Novakovic
Chairperson & CEO

We believe there's margin improvement headroom at Gulfstream, and we'll continue to pursue that. It's not about necessarily pursuing growth that's in our backlog, but it's about execution, execution, execution. That's throughout the whole company. It's really a strategy. Gulfstream and Jet Aviation are no different. So we will continue to push margin, and we see high probability of improved margins over time.

Myles Walton
Wolfe Research, LLC

Is mid- to high teens still reasonable for '27?

Phebe Novakovic
Chairperson & CEO

Look, we'll -- I think as we execute this backlog, we'll continue to push margins. We've got lots of puts and takes in this business, as you well know, and how all of the costs and the pricing opportunities play out over the next couple of years will drive it. But you should expect significant and consistent margin improvement over time throughout our plan period.

Myles Walton
Wolfe Research, LLC

And is the combat growth in '26 absorbing much of any headwind on the AJAX program, if you could size that.

Phebe Novakovic
Chairperson & CEO

I wouldn't say there's any headwind on the AJAX program. We have a pause in the fielding, but we are highly, highly confident in this vehicle. It has been tested for tens of thousands of miles, and we have great confidence in it.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Robert Stallard at Vertical Research.

Robert Stallard
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Phebe, given some of the geopolitical activities over the last few weeks, I was wondering if you've seen any change in the conversation with your European customers with regards to buying U.S.-sourced equipment rather than stuff you actually make in Europe?

Phebe Novakovic
Chairperson & CEO

We have not. But let me remind you that the biggest source of business that we have in Europe are European-based and almost fully sourced European businesses. They're indigenous businesses that we've had for, in some cases, over 25 years. And they are manned, run, led and sourced in Europe.

Robert Stallard
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Okay. And then secondly, on the aerospace side, there's been concerns over the last few months perhaps over this AI bubble. I was wondering if there has been any notable change in your backlog here and whether there has been any increase in AI-related orders over the last, say, 6 to 12 months?

Phebe Novakovic
Chairperson & CEO

You mean a Gulfstream, AI-driven from AI-driven companies. We haven't seen any of that. I'd say the demand is across the portfolio, very heavy in the Fortune 500, high net worth and -- Fortune 500 companies, high net worth individuals. But there's no one particular segment that jumps out or is anomalous.

Operator

We'll go next to Ron Epstein at Bank of America.

Ronald Epstein
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just a couple of quick ones here for you, Phebe. Battleships, how do you think about battleships, Battleships [ Gold Run ]? I mean that's a lot of stuff going on. How do you think about that with your ship business?

Phebe Novakovic
Chairperson & CEO

Bath is participating in the design with other industry partners on that battleship that's just recently announced. So I think it will be quite some time in playing out. But it really is at its beginning design phases. So really too soon to project anything in terms of timing.

Ronald Epstein
BofA Securities, Research Division

Is there like going to be a down select? Have they boarded it? I mean is it -- I don't know how to think about it. Is it going to be like a typical...

Phebe Novakovic
Chairperson & CEO

I don't believe we know the competition strategy right now.

Ronald Epstein
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. Okay. Fair enough. And then is this too simple of a way to think about Gulfstream. So let me just -- everybody has been asking the bizjet question. So sorry, apologies for new one. But in kind of really simple terms, you guys have brought to market sort of a refreshed fleet of kit, right? So a bunch of new airplanes. That's driving demand, right, because you got the newest stuff out there.

It's early days in many of these programs. So as you go down the learning curve, naturally, you should get some margin expansion. So as we walk out over the next several years, naturally, shouldn't we just see margins improve because you just get better at building the new airplanes and presumably, not to put words in anybody's mouth, not going to launch anything immediately. So you've got this stuff maturing, margins go up and demand stays good because you've got a new product out there. Is that too simple a way to think about it?

Phebe Novakovic
Chairperson & CEO

I think you have quite eloquently defined and expressed our strategy. Our new airplanes are driving demand. We continue to come down our learning curve. The supply chain is improving, has a way to go, but it's definitely better than it was. And all of that will drive additional margin improvement measured over time.

But the investments we made years ago in these new products are coming to fruition and the market is benefiting from this whole new family of clean sheet airplanes. Nobody else has anything like it. So we worked hard. We earned it. This isn't something that just happened overnight. There's a lot of long, thoughtful targeted R&D and capital investments.

Ronald Epstein
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. Got it. And then maybe if I could just slip in one last one. You've been running the company for a while and you've been on the hill and been all over. How do you think about some of the stuff coming out of the administration directing defense companies on what -- how to deploy capital? I mean, as a leader of an organization that's deployed capital arguably pretty prudently over the years, how do you think about that?

Phebe Novakovic
Chairperson & CEO

Well, our strategy over the last several years is aligned with the administration's commitment to an intent to increase production, and we are an increased -- the demand signals are very strong. So we have been investing in our business, and we'll continue to do so. I think that's the best way to think about it.

Operator

We'll take our next question from John Godyn at Citi.

John Godyn
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I wanted to keep digging into the trend in munitions. You had so many positive call-outs in the prepared remarks. Obviously, we've seen a lot of growth in the weapon systems and munitions subsegment within Combat Systems. And I get a lot of questions on how long that strength might last, where production rates and run rate revenue can go over multiple years and what incremental margins on munitions revenue look like versus overall Combat Systems margins. So I know you might not want to give all that detail, but I was hoping we could just dialogue a bit about the trajectory just to get a better handle on the shape of the business over the coming years.

Phebe Novakovic
Chairperson & CEO

We have a good business in munitions. We are a supplier to many of the missile companies. So we expect the demand signals that the administration and outside the U.S. have been issuing are manifesting in contracts. We expect that to continue.

Stores and inventories are low, and those inventories need to be replaced. So we are well positioned. We'll continue to work our margins as we always do. This is a business that tends to be in the 14% to 15% margin range. We expect that to continue with some variability. It's all about their operating leverage and their ability to come down their learning curves and control their costs.

John Godyn
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's very helpful. And if I could just ask one more on supply chain and Gulfstream. And I know there's been some dialogue on that already on the call. But specifically, with commercial aerospace production volumes ramping, do you think there's any knock-on impact on bizjet supply chain, whether it's demand for materials, subcomponents, labor, et cetera? Anything there to think through?

Phebe Novakovic
Chairperson & CEO

Well, labor is not a problem. Are you asking whether we see material issues in the supply chain?

John Godyn
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

With Boeing ramping production dramatically, Airbus as well, these are not one of that in case that...

Phebe Novakovic
Chairperson & CEO

Well, let me answer this. I'd say that some of the suppliers have ramped more successfully than others. We know the ones who still have some work to go. They're committed to making the investments to increase their capacity. So it's really about capacity throughput. And the causes for that constrained environment in some of those suppliers is really just about the investment in capacity, training a workforce, but quality remains good, which is critical.

Nicole Shelton
Vice President of Investor Relations

So Audra, I think we have time for one more question.

Operator

That question comes from Andre Madrid at BTIG.

Andre Madrid
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to really nail down into international a bit. Could you maybe tell us what the book-to-bill was for the quarter and for the year? And I mean, how are you thinking about demand moving into '26? I know we've talked about it in each of the individual segments. But is it fair to say that growth in international will probably outpace the broader business in the next year?

Phebe Novakovic
Chairperson & CEO

Are you talking about Combat Systems primarily because there is none in Marine Group. Gulfstream...

Andre Madrid
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Yes. Yes.

Danny Deep
President

Yes. I can answer that. Yes. So I think, as Kim said, we had a book-to-bill in the fourth quarter at specifically at European Land Systems of over 4:1, so that was by far the biggest impact. And I think as you think about it in the context of Combat, which is where the bulk of our international activity is, European Land Systems will be the fastest grower by far. And so we expect to see really, really positive growth over the planned period. And you'll start to see the real acceleration, as Phebe said earlier, in '27 and beyond. Some of these are long-cycle programs. But certainly, at European Land Systems, we expect to grow quickly.

Andre Madrid
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then if I could squeeze one more in. I know back at [ AUS Day ] in October, you highlighted some of the demand that you're seeing around UGVs. We've seen them being used to extreme effect in Eastern Europe right now. What do you think the market looks like for unmanned ground? I mean is that something that might be much more tangible in the years to come? Is there like kind of a benchmark that you guys are setting for how that business might perform?

Phebe Novakovic
Chairperson & CEO

We're not setting a particular benchmark, but I would say that the U.S. Army is in a period of transition where they move to the most advanced technologically capable systems, both in their unmanned systems, the mobile protected firepower communications in GPS environment. So we're seeing really a transition as the U.S. Army modernizes its forces.

And we don't have any particular benchmarks with respect to some of the smaller areas of investment for us, but we've made those investments to support that growth, and we're quite confident that we are well positioned to support them going forward.

Nicole Shelton
Vice President of Investor Relations

All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. Please refer to the General Dynamics website for the fourth quarter earnings release and highlights presentation. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at (703) 876-3152.

Operator

And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.
