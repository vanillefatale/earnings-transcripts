[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.

Matthew Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats on another really nice quarter. So Jason, maybe to kick off, could you elaborate on the further acceleration and momentum into 2026 that you cited? And just larger picture, how do you see your portfolio differentiated today relative to that $2 trillion total vacation market with the opportunity to capture additional market share from here?

Jason Liberty
CEO & Chairman

Well, thanks, Matt. I hope you're doing well. One, I think that, obviously, our business is growing. Our capacity is growing 6.7% this year. And one of the things that we just see coming into this year, and we saw this even during the Black Friday and Cyber sale activities that we've seen an acceleration in demand, which, of course, more than matches the capacity that we have coming on.

So we continue to see a very strong consumer who is really attracted to our incredible brands and the experiences that they're delivering. We're also seeing additional tailwind, and you can see that in our -- just in terms of on the loyalty side, we're seeing an increase in the percentage of our guests that are loyalists.

So our loyalty programs and now with that coming with Point Choice, we're seeing more and more high-quality demand for our guests. And of course, with loyalty, you're able to personalize more and put a very effective package in front of them in terms of what they're looking to achieve with their friends and family that they're sailing with.

As we look at the business, and you've heard me say this in the past, we really do look at that $2 trillion plus. I mean it's growing now. It's even over $2 trillion leisure space for us to grab more share of. And when you get into why are we so focused on -- obviously, there's many reasons to do that to close that gap and focus less on our cruise competitors is that we think that we're able to increase our margins by putting a product in place that is really attracted to our guests.

And so what you're seeing us do commercially first is we're making sure that we are personalizing, putting things in front of our guests that they're attracted to and taking friction out of how they book their activities each and every day. On the product standpoint, we listen very closely to what our guests are looking for. And so you're seeing us on the new ships that we deliver. You're seeing it on the modernization activities we're doing and also the changes we're making on the ship to how do we close the gap to what our guests are looking to, not just for a cruise vacation, but for a broader vacation experience.

And then on the destination side, you're seeing us invest in enhancing the guest experience. And when you look at, for example, I think Santorini is a great example of this. We're not looking to take guests out of the key cities of Santorini. What we're looking to do is help them maximize their day and spend time in our private destination of the Royal Beach Club that will be there as well as in the key cities of Santorini.

So all this is really focused on how do we enhance the experience -- and when we find when we're doing that, we're building more trust, and we're also enhancing the overall guest experience, and we see that just through the change in the Net Promoter Score. Then when you get into the ecosystem, we think about what are our guests doing when they're not with us. And so one way you grab share of that $2 trillion marketplace is you expand your offering.

And so that's one of the things that historically, we would expand our offering by add more destinations. Here, we see that when our guests are not with us or some of our guests when they're not with us, they're taking an additional vacation on River. And that's why we feel so passionate about getting deeper and deeper into that business. And what we see is we're closing gaps to Orlando. We're closing gaps to Vegas. We're closing gaps to other vacation all-inclusive experiences, which get higher APDs than us, probably at least 15% higher on APDs.

And so we're trying to close that gap. We think we deliver a higher value proposition than what happens on land. And that collectively, you tie that together with great loyalty, personalization is resulting in, I think, what you see is outperformance.

Naftali Holtz
Chief Financial Officer

Just to add one more thing to what Jason said. So all these things that we're doing, as you can see this year, we're growing both capacity and yield. And as we look at it, we feel that this is a differentiation within the vacation marketplace. And that leads really to winning more share from the consumers in that $2 trillion market.

So we feel very passionate that we'll continue to innovate and that sets us -- so continue to innovate and add more experiences like River, and that sets us very well to continue to win that share from that $2 trillion, which is obviously a very big market.

Your next question comes from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel.

Steven Wieczynski
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Congrats on a strong 2025. So they want me to ask one question. I'm going to do that, but it's going to be 2 different parts. So I'm going to -- so Jason, obviously, there's a lot of concern in the market about Caribbean capacity and what that means in terms of taking price action, especially on the close-in side of things. So if you could, could you walk us through maybe what you're seeing today in the Caribbean, maybe more so whether it's by brand, whether it's by itinerary, whether it's by specific product?

And I guess what I'm trying to understand is what is doing well in the Caribbean, what might be lagging? And then I would assume that you guys are probably taking a conservative approach to what close-in pricing is going to look like in the Caribbean, given the industry capacity increases?

And then second part of my question would be, Jason, if you think about your 2026 yield guidance, 2.5% at the midpoint, just wondering if that 2.5% fits with your company tagline, meaning you guys talked about moderate yield growth. And I'm just wondering if 2.5% fits that profile? Or is this a year where yield growth might be more hampered given what's happening in the Caribbean?

Jason Liberty
CEO & Chairman

Okay. Well, thanks, Steve.

Steven Wieczynski
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Sorry.

Jason Liberty
CEO & Chairman

Okay. Well, thanks, Steve. I think there were more than 2 questions in that. But I think first off, just talking about the Caribbean and certainly my colleagues here can chime in as well. Of course, we read what everybody else is putting out there in terms of points of view on the Caribbean. I think first, what I think we need to point out is I think when you have the best ships and you have the best destinations and you have brands that have incredible loyalty and trust with their guests, that equates to, which is what we're seeing is very similar demand trends for the Caribbean as we're seeing in other parts of the world.

Now there is a significant level of demand for Europe, which is great, but it's also not a place where we have over half of our capacity. But you're seeing very good trends in the Caribbean across all 3 brands. So if you want to get into -- are we concerned about [indiscernible] or too much supply, we're seeing it, whether it's on the Royal Caribbean brand or celebrity or Silversea, we're seeing high demand wanting to go to the Caribbean.

And so as Naf commented, we're not only seeing good volume, but our pricing is higher in the Caribbean than it was last year. And I know that may not feed into what maybe some groups want to hear, but that is a reality that we continue to see strong demand for the Caribbean, and we continue to see strong demand for our broader organization.

And that leads us when we think about 2026, yes, I mean, there are a few things that we did not expect, for example, with some of the redeployments we've had to make around China. And that also resulted in a little bit more of our deployment in locations that are a little bit lower yielding, doesn't mean they're less margin or less profit. They just may not have the same price point as something else.

And that's why we're seeing strong earnings growth coming out of all of this. But when you think about a company that our capacity is growing 6.7% this year. Our total revenue was up double digits. I think it's up almost 88% versus '19 total revenue. And so we're growing our business. We're going to continue to grow our business moderately. And the yield, I mean, typically, we think about moderate yield growth somewhere between 2% to 4%, we're in that 2% to 4%, probably be a little bit better if it wasn't for China.

But besides that, we're seeing people who are willing to pay more money than they did last year. They're willing to spend more money on the ships than they did last year. We're getting the volumes that are more than what our capacity increases. And we're benefiting from a lot of the investments that we've made around AI and loyalty and so forth. The last comment I just want to make about -- the comment I just made about that our total revenue is growing double digits in 2026. The Caribbean total revenue is growing by double digits in 2026.

Your next question comes from James Hardiman with Citi.

James Hardiman
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I actually just wanted to continue down that same line of thinking. Maybe if you could help us think about your business sort of organic versus inorganic. Obviously, you've got another Icon Class ship coming on. You've got some calendar benefits from last year's Icon and celebrity ships. And then you've got the Royal Beach Club coming on.

I don't think you're going to get any benefit from the second one in Cosmo, but at least that first one. And so when I just think about the inorganic stuff, it sort of feels like you could get maybe north of 2% on that alone. So how should I think about the organic business and then maybe specifically the organic business in Caribbean, just given the idea that, that seems to be if there's going to be more capacity coming to the Caribbean those older ships, the older tonnage probably is taking on the brunt of that -- the competitive environment that you're seeing from one of your peers?

Jason Liberty
CEO & Chairman

Well, thanks, James, for the question. And I think first, as we look at our yield profile for this year, about half of it is going to come from new hardware. By the way, as we add new hardware into our environment, just because the denominator is bigger, it has less of effect on our yield improvement. So half of it is going to come from new hardware or new -- and the other half is coming from like-for-like.

I'll have Michael talk for a second here in a minute on the Royal Beach Club. But historically, if you look at when we launched Perfect Day, we started very slow in the buildup of that business. And we do that very intently to make sure that we have mastered the experience and Michael and his team are masters at doing that before we kind of ramp up to more significant levels.

But when you think about our business, like that's typically the tailwinds that we see. We see like-for-like yield growth, by the way, that also includes the Caribbean. And you're also seeing the benefits of the new hardware as it comes on. Sometimes in quarters, it's a little bit when some of the new ships are coming in, some of the deployment changes, especially even when like new ships come in, like a ship might have been in on a Saturday, now it goes out on a Friday, that can sometimes play a little bit of a mix in that.

Michael Bayley
President & CEO of Royal Caribbean International

James, it's Michael. Just to comment on Jason's commentary regarding the Royal Beach Club and the opening. We typically start all of these new products slowly. We have capacity restraints when we open up just to make sure that we've got the product absolutely perfect, and that's exactly what we've done with the Royal Beach Club. The great news is that within 4 weeks, the Royal Beach Club has already become the #1 top-rated experience in the Nassau for our cruise guests, and it's already outperformed all other products that are available in the market. That's exactly where we want to be.

So we're pushing it now to get to exactly the same level of satisfaction as Perfect Day. Our latest results show it about 0.81% behind Perfect Day for a satisfaction delivery, which means that the NPS is really stunning. So we're moving towards that goal of making sure that we've got the perfect product and the demand now is really starting to ramp up, and we feel like we're going to have a huge success with the product.

Naftali Holtz
Chief Financial Officer

Just one other thing about the yields and the like-for-like. Obviously, the yield is just one part of the equation. We also look at the profitability of the ships. So if you kind of look at the way we are expecting margins to grow this year and of course, earnings, there is also the ability to not only benefit from new ships, efficiency and scale and just better margins, but we also make -- even if we make those deployment changes, we find ways to also run them more efficiently and deliver the guest experience in a better way. So the profitability is also growing on both, not just the yield.

Your next question comes from Lizzie Dove with Goldman Sachs.

Elizabeth Dove
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Congrats on a great year. I guess thinking more -- you gave a lot of great color in terms of some of the cadence for the year and the factors on the dry dock side of things and deployment, islands, et cetera.

Could you maybe share a little more in terms of how you're thinking about that net yield cadence for the year, I guess, in terms of the ramp of what's factored into your guidance and I suppose specifically for 2Q, given you kind of called out on the dry dock side?

Naftali Holtz
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. We're not -- I'm not going to comment specifically about Q2, more about the first half and the second half. But as I said in the prepared remarks, there are really a couple of things that are driving that cadence. One is dry dock timing. So we do have more dry docks than last year. And I've talked about them being more in the second quarter versus the first quarter and of course, towards the end of the year.

One thing that is a little unique in this year is that we have also larger ships going into modernization or dry docks. And so those come obviously with higher yields. So the year-over-year comparison is different. And then we have also more Silversea ships significantly in the last year. And so those are, of course, also high yielding. So this is more about how the comps work and year-over-year cadence.

The second one is the ramp-up of the Royal Beach Club, Michael talked about. We want to get the experience right. We're doing great, and we'll just make it better. And so there's a little bit of impact that. And then some of the deployment and mixes and the timing of new ships that we have every year. And so that's really the main impact of the cadence throughout the year.

Your next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS Financial.

Robin Farley
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I wanted to ask about the new ship order, the Discovery class. There's not a ton of detail, but the industry chatter is that it's going to be much smaller than the Icon Oasis, a lot of other ships you've done. And so I wonder if you could talk a little bit about -- I assume that means you can put them in higher-yielding destinations or just kind of what's the trade-off between maybe those ships not being as much capacity growth versus pricing?

And then I'm just going to squeeze in a part 2, I won't make it, but just on net cruise costs, just this is like year 2 here of just incredibly low net cruise cost. Is this due to just the timing of 2 years in a row of dry dock days, something related? Or is this actually like a sustainable rate of net cruise cost growth that we would think about longer term?

Michael Bayley
President & CEO of Royal Caribbean International

Robin, it's Michael. I'll talk a little bit about Discovery. Actually, I'm really not going to talk about Discovery. We've been working on Discovery for the last couple of years. And from the business perspective, we are really excited with the innovation, creativity and the kind of product that we've now created with Discovery. It really is going to be a game changer.

Just as Icon was introduced and kind of changed the game, Discovery is going to do exactly the same thing. We are really looking forward to sharing more details about Discovery with the marketplace, but we're not planning on saying much about it today or in the next couple of months. We have a promotional campaign that will be ready to go soon, and we'll be very excited to visit multiple cities and start talking about Discovery.

I can tell you that it really is going to be a game changer. Many of the assumptions that are currently out there in social media, et cetera, in terms of size, capacity, et cetera, et cetera, are probably, it's fair to say, inaccurate. So we're looking forward to introducing it. It's going to be a big deal, and we'll make sure that you get an invitation.

Naftali Holtz
Chief Financial Officer

Okay. And Robin, I'll cover the cost. So I think for -- you know our formula, and we do subscribe to it. And that's the way we run the business. And so we want to always have that spread between yield growth and cost growth, and we believe that that's the right way to do that. And so that's going to follow our formula, right? And this year, it follows that formula.

I think the first thing to really -- that is really important, we're very proud of how our teams not only growing the commercial aspects of it and revenue, but how they are also delivering the experience and the cost that management when we do that. And what's very, very important to us is we are not compromising on the product, because for us, it's really important that we continue to deliver the best vacation experiences.

And Jason talked a lot about how that will carry us and allow us to grow sustainably into the future and win share. The other thing that is -- the 2 other things that are kind of helping us in terms of how we manage costs. First, our capacity growth this year is 6.7%. And so you should expect from us, and we expect from ourselves that we can leverage the scale of this business. We're now going to be $8 billion company that as we continue to grow the capacity, right, there comes some economies of scale on the cost side as well. That's one.

And the second one is that we're finding more and more ways, and Jason talked about it in his prepared remarks, about how do we more sustainably and smartly run the business, utilizing all the disruptive technology that's out there, including AI and GenAI. And we talked a little bit about how we're doing that on large commercial activities, but it's really infused in everything that we do day-to-day, and the teams are really working through that and utilizing it to find better ways to run the business.

Jason Liberty
CEO & Chairman

Yes. And I just want to -- just to add on, on the AI side because I think a lot of times, it's attributed to people like you're going to have less people. I think we look at AI as really allowing us to do more higher purpose activities to enhance the experience for our guests. And our business, especially because of the scale of our business, you just -- you can think about supply chain, you think about how our ships get from point A to point B, you think about how we yield manage or just being able to get people to start kind of further up the chain in their -- in the activity that they do, that yields not only a better experience for our guests, a better experience for our employees, but also then provides the cost opportunities for us.

And so we see it as a huge commercial enhancer. It's a significant guest experience enhancer. We see it as really tooling our employees to make their experience better and for them to provide higher value. And it's less about what I think sometimes we think that there's just like less people. We actually see it as more as it creates a lot of new things that we could be doing that's going to drive higher margins into our business.

Your next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays.

Brandt Montour
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

So we spent a lot of time on the supply situation in the Caribbean. My question is more about how maybe industry participants away from you have reacted to that. Does it feel -- I mean, Jason, you've been watching this industry for a long time. Does it feel like a little bit more or less rational than maybe what this type of environment would have engendered in the past?

And sitting here halfway through Wave with industry volumes so far seemingly pretty strong across the board. Are we at a point now where maybe things can improve or sort of still wait and see?

Jason Liberty
CEO & Chairman

Well, it's only been 20 years. But I've seen a lot and Michael, for sure, has seen a lot over the 20 years in terms of all the different kind of promotional activities. For sure, this industry is so much more rational, so much more about price integrity. And there's always promotions in the market. And -- but those promotions in the market are, we would say, very similar to what we saw last year or 2 years ago and similar to what we saw in 2017, '18, '19, et cetera.

Now there's -- if you go back probably a decade ago, you saw some irrational activity. But I think overall, we would say that it's rational. There's a lot of price integrity. Our travel partners are doing such an exceptional job in generating high-quality demand as well as our other channels as we're for sure, a channel of choice.

And so I think collectively, from what I can see, there's a lot of rational activities. And that, by the way, also expands into really have a look at our true competitive set, which includes land-based vacations. And when we -- and I think somewhat the cruise side of this is a little bit insulated because of the price gap to land-based, but we're certainly chasing to see how we can go about and close that.

Operator

Your next question comes from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research.

Conor Cunningham
Melius Research LLC

Just maybe a comment around the close-in booking strength. I was just hoping you could talk about your skewed itineraries that are moving more towards 3 to 4 days versus 7 plus. It's not in the context of like you having less visibility. It's more in the idea of close-in demand has the opportunity to move yields a lot more. So just can you talk a little bit about that and how -- I think it was 20% in 2025. So if you could just maybe correct that number, but also give your thought process around '26 and beyond.

Jason Liberty
CEO & Chairman

Yes. Well, first, Conor, I think that coming in -- obviously, over the past, call it, 3 or 4 years, we certainly have made it a priority to bring more short product to the market. And that is to really match how guests or certain segments you want to go out in vacation. They want more vacation experiences. They want them more often. They want them shorter duration. That's not everybody, but there are certain segments that want that great weekend getaway.

And so we certainly have added that into this. But we haven't -- we're now kind of in a more mature state with those short products. But as you pointed out, it is closer in business. But the reason why I want to combine those 2 thoughts about it's closer in business and we've kind of -- we've reached kind of a good level of scale, not that there's not more growth. It's just that it's not going from single digits into something that's more material into our business.

So those thoughts are important to bring together is that our yield management models, right, do catch up, right? I mean they are AI-based. They do learn. And so when we think about close-in, and you could see this in the fourth quarter, we did see better demand, but it's not -- it doesn't necessarily mean that, that better demand is going to result in what we saw in previous quarters with close-in booking.

I think we have a pretty good handle now on close-in demand, how we market it, how we price it, how it comes in. And our yield management and our forecasting is informed by all of that. I think the other point I want to say on the short product side that I think Michael and Laura have really -- on the Celebrity side have done an exceptional job is they have really elevated the experience.

Our guests walk away with having the best vacation weekend certainly of the year. And of course, we wanted to be at the lifetime, but certainly of the year. And I think that when you're delivering that experience and you're building that trust, it's an incredible feeder for our broader part of our business, especially new-to-cruise because now they're hooked on the vacation experience. And that's also yielding more reps we're getting out of our guests, and that's resulting in achieving that goal of delivering a lifetime of vacations.

Michael Bayley
President & CEO of Royal Caribbean International

And Conor, just to add to Jason's comments. I mean, for Royal, we've got -- now we've got 2 Oasis class ships, one out of Port Canaveral, one out of Miami moving twice a week, carrying around 12,000 people per ship per week. So that's 24,000 a week going to Perfect Day in CocoCay. And now, of course, with the Royal Beach Club and they're also going to the Royal Beach Club.

So when you think about the proposition in the marketplace to the customer, the fact that you can get on these incredible ships, just pack full of activities and entertainment features, multiple restaurants, then wake up in the morning and take the kids to Perfect Day at CocoCay and then have a great show in the evening and the next day, get to the Royal Beach Club and be back in work on Monday morning, it's really a fantastic proposition. And we've seen the demand for those products really accelerating. And of course, the kind of the margins that we generate on those products are really quite significant.

The other comment is the simplicity of booking, the ease of being able to get on board these ships. It's become increasingly easier. And then with all of the investments that we've made over time in the pre-cruise planning and the ability to start communicating with our guests about opportunities to book and buy products before they come on board.

All of that is really combined to make this a very seamless, easy product to buy, and that's exactly what we're seeing. And so in many ways, it does encourage people to wait a little longer before they book because they know how simple it is, and they also know what a great time they're going to have.

Your next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies.

David Katz
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Can you just talk about what information or inputs you have with respect to River that are driving the increased commitment there? And the degree to which you believe you can induce trial of your current customer base versus taking share from existing River cruise companies? An update there would be great.

Jason Liberty
CEO & Chairman

Sure. Well, obviously, we are very excited about River. Of course, when we announced River and we announced the first 10 ships, I also, at the same time, I said this was not going to be a hobby. And so we are -- this is another, I think, point of evidence that this is not a hobby for us. And we feel -- well, obviously, we've done a lot of research before even announcing this or getting into this about the trust that we've built with our customers, how loyalty affects them and that really their desire for an elevated River experience.

And so, we felt very strongly just based off -- we have 9.5 million guests a year. This year, we'll have over 10 million guests sailing with us. We have a massive database of loyalists that our ability to generate high-quality demand is, I think, very strong. That really availed itself when we began to tease it and build waiting lists and so forth that you immediately saw specifically from our loyalty guests, not just with the celebrity brand, but across our 3 brands, a strong desire to take a vacation on River with us.

And of course, that -- we see that every day in terms of the demand from -- we hear from the trade and from our customers for any open spot that they can possibly get. So we feel very good about it. And I think we always just need to remember that these are not 20 -- 7,500 passenger ships. These are sub-200 passenger ships, and we're very excited. And we think that Europe is just one area of the world where our guests want to go on River.

Naftali Holtz
Chief Financial Officer

Just one -- 2 other things to add is as we were opening for sale, obviously, the demand actually exceeded our expectations. So that gave us a lot of confidence also as well. And that's both on the volume, but also on the price. And then one other maybe data point that really was encouraging to us because this is what we thought is going to happen is that roughly 80% of the people that booked are actually existing customers, but they've never experienced River Cruise before.

And so they're very excited because they trust the Celebrity brand to actually experience another different vacation with the celebrity brand. And that tells you that we can have an opportunity not only to attract other River Cruisers, but also expand the market.
