Question-and-Answer Session

Ryan Weispfenning
VP & Head of Investor Relations

Sure, Geoff. [Operator Instructions] Finally, please be advised that this Q&A session is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Okay, let's take the first question from Patrick Wood at Morgan Stanley.

Patrick Wood
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I'll keep it to one, of course. I'd love to start with Symplicity. You mentioned the commercial discussions happening faster than kind of expected. Obviously, without diving into any individual payer, how are those reflective relative to the NCD? Like are there restrictions being put on? What is the sort of tone of the conversation? And how are the commercial payers looking to introduce this within their patient pool?

Geoffrey Martha
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. Thanks for the question, Patrick. The commercial payers, like I mentioned in the commentary, they are coming online faster than I believe we anticipated. They're getting a lot of push from patients as well. In terms of restrictions, first of all, I'd say, look, the Medicare NCD is broad, and it's better than we anticipated. It's better than the proposal. So we're comparing it to that.

The one area that I've heard, in addition, on NCD, they've incorporated physician -- for lack of a better word, physician discretion, patient discretion on, hey, as a patient, can I tolerate these meds? Or does the physician feel like the patient cannot tolerate the meds? That gives them that avenue to move to RDN, to Symplicity.

In the commercial payers, we're seeing where there is one difference that I know of is around the medication, so more of an emphasis on being on a few medications for a while. So that's the one area that I'm aware of, Patrick, and we'll keep everyone posted as we get more commercial payers online.

Ryan Weispfenning
VP & Head of Investor Relations

We'll take the next question from Travis Steed at BofA Global Securities.

Travis Steed
BofA Securities, Research Division

Congrats on a good quarter. I guess, first of all, the implied second half guide around 6%, and kind of think about it in 2 buckets, the pipeline and then kind of the base business. And maybe talk about kind of what you're assuming on RDN in the second half, and then also the base business, why confident in the slight rebound in MedSurg and kind of the confidence to keep the base business humming?

And then on the margins in the second half, this quarter, we didn't see quite as much margin flow through. Just assuming that changes in the second half, the revenue upside leads to more margin upside in the second half?

Geoffrey Martha
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Do you want to take that one?

Thierry Pieton
Executive VP & CFO

So maybe I'll start with the margin. Travis, thanks for the question. Look, we described the momentum that we had from a commercial perspective in the second quarter. And pretty early on in the quarter, we saw the order intake being pretty strong. We also saw that we were going to have a little bit of upside from a tax perspective, even though that's timing, but we did see it coming early on in the quarter. And so we just made a decision to go invest in the places that are going to drive the growth going forward.

So we made some significant investments in the mappers structure, for example, in Cardiac Ablation. We started to build up the capability from a direct marketing on the Symplicity side. So we took the opportunity that we were going to see upside on revenue and a little bit on the tax line just to lean into the investment to make sure we fully capture the opportunities that are ahead of us.

And so you saw that in R&D. It's the second quarter where we have R&D growth that's pretty significantly higher than the revenue growth. And this quarter, specifically, you saw it on the SG&A line, where we put, as I said, quite a bit of investment, especially in sales and marketing, while keeping the G&A line pretty constrained. So going forward into the rest of the year, we'll keep investing in these growth areas.

You'll see R&D continue to ramp up. As you know, we're targeting to get over time to roughly about 10% of our revenue on the R&D line. On SG&A, though, you should expect to see leverage in the second half. So SG&A together. So we'll start seeing a lift there. And so ex tariffs, we'll have gross margin and operating margin leverage in the second half. But we'll have to contend with the tariff impact.

So all in all, on a full year basis, you'll see gross margin slightly up before tariffs, down about 50 basis points post tariffs. And at the operating margin level, you'll see operating margin roughly flat year-over-year ex tariffs and slightly down with the impact of tariffs. So look, it's all about capitalizing on the opportunities that we've got ahead of us, and that's what we'll keep doing. But again, second half leverage on both those lines.

Geoffrey Martha
Chairman of the Board & CEO

So on the revenue, as you see from the guidance, we're looking at a back half ramp here that will extend into '27. And the way I'd break it down, I mean a big piece of that, is these growth drivers that are kicking in, these multibillion-dollar opportunities. In terms of the back half, though, most of that is really coming from PFA. So -- in terms of the new big ones, right? When you think about PFA, Symplicity, Altaviva and we have Hugo coming, those, we would say, are big multibillion-dollar upmarket opportunities. In the back half, the contribution will be more from PMA in that category. PFA, I mean, is cranking right now. We've got a lot of momentum there.

When it comes to Symplicity -- obviously, Symplicity and Altaviva are approved in the U.S. On Symplicity, I'd say we're going to see it start to tick up in the back half of the year and then ramp in the quarters following that. Like I said, between the NCD and the commercial payers coming online, this market is really a best case scenario. It's as big as what we said it is. It's not about if or even how big, like it's as big as we said, it's really how fast. And we're measuring that speed of adoption in quarters, not years.

Altaviva, again, just approved, a lot of great leading indicators. Physician training is overbooked, and we can talk more about that if I get questions on why we're so excited. Again, it will start to contribute in the back half a little bit. And then Hugo, we don't have too much on, but we do still expect the approval in the back half of our year.

Then there's another -- getting to the base business, Diabetes pops back up as our new sensors are available. Neuromodulation continues to be strong. CST will continue to be strong. CRM had a really good Q2. I don't know if we're going to have that same level of growth there, but still a strong growth there. And then you've got two other businesses that will, I'll call it, tick up, incrementally increase their growth rate, Peripheral Vascular with the carotid stent, mechanical thrombectomy coming. And then Neurovascular, again, it's also selling that carotid stent. Got some hemorrhagic products coming. And they're just lapping some issues, a recall and then lapping VVP here. So the base business is a big contributor. PFA is a big contributor. And then you're going to start to see Symplicity, Altaviva and a little bit of Hugo.

Ryan Weispfenning
VP & Head of Investor Relations

Next, we'll go to the line of Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI.

Vijay Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Congrats on a nice sprint here. I had maybe a new product question, a 2-parter, if you will. One on Affera, Geoff, do you feel like we have enough mappers now? And is supply in a place enough where you can hit the $2 billion? How are you thinking about supply and mapping?

And then on tibial, we've got some good feedback on cannibalization of -- whether tibial could cannibalize BOTOX procedures. Could tibial be a $1 billion product for you guys down the road?

Geoffrey Martha
Chairman of the Board & CEO

So I'll start with the PFA questions. On the supply, that's not holding us back. So supply is in a good spot. And then on the mappers, the mapper hiring is going well, right? We're staying ahead, but I wish the buffer a little bit more, because the growth is tremendous. But we are staying ahead on the mappers and the supply is not an issue. And like I said, our PFA business is really humming.

I was just with a big customer yesterday. They've got 2 systems. They laid out 3 more that they're going to buy. And just talking about once they put -- especially Affera, once they put that in one of their hospitals, how it kind of takes all the market share or the majority of the market share there for all types of cases. There's just all these benefits there. So feeling really good about that. And again, this mapper hiring has been a Medtronic, not just our Cardiac Ablation business, but a Medtronic effort, and our HR team is doing a hell of a job there.

And then on tibial. Look, tibial is something I think everyone needs to invest a little bit of time in here. It's a huge market, 46 million people in the U.S. with overactive bladder and of that 16 million with urinary urge incontinence, where this really shines. And it takes the therapy versus sacral, which works really well. It's been a great market for us. There's been some channel disruption in the market lately, but it's still a great market and works really well for patients. But it does take weeks or months to get that therapy to a patient from when they start versus tibial is less than a day. So what you're seeing here is, with tibial, right, you have to do -- I mean, with the sacral nerve, you have to do a trial, then you have to go in for the implant, then the patient leaves without the therapy turned on, has to come back to get it activated, versus tibial, this all happens in a day and the procedure is easier.

And when patients, to get to the core of your question, when they're presented with options, all of their options, sacral nerve, tibial, BOTOX, they tend to choose the tibial. So we do think it will take share from BOTOX. And I would emphasize that this, we believe -- look, there's a very strong place for sacral nerve. This is an incremental opportunity on top of our sacral business. And so sacral combined with tibial, given that it's going to be incremental, this is going to make that business, that Pelvic Health business, a growth driver for the company. That's what I'll say about that. It's going to meaningfully improve the growth rate of that business.

Ryan Weispfenning
VP & Head of Investor Relations

Next, let's go to the line of Robbie Marcus at JPMorgan.

Robert Marcus
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Nice quarter. Thierry, I wanted to ask, you talked about strategically reinvesting into SG&A and, over time, materially increasing R&D, I think, up to 200 basis points. How are you thinking about where those dollars are going? How soon should we be thinking about that? And just help us think about the cadence and the ability to still grow operating margin in the face of higher investment.

Thierry Pieton
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Robbie, thanks for the question. So first, where the dollars are going? So there are really 2 different categories, I would say. One is, as I said, to capitalize to the maximum extent possible on the growth drivers that are ahead of us. So there's a significant amount of investment that's going to CAS, to RDN, to Altaviva and, obviously, to Hugo with a profile that's a little bit more long term. There are other growth drivers that we're funding at the same time such as Structural Heart and Neuromodulation, for example.

The second category of where we're putting investment is to make sure that we keep the leading edge from a technology perspective in the key franchises that are our bread and butter. So there's overinvestment compared to the average of the business in CRM, for example, in next generation of Micra. And there's significant investment going in CST to continue to develop the ecosystem that, that business has created around AiBLE that has enabled us to make the CST business more sticky with the customers from a device perspective and gradually improve the margin. So it's really those 2 areas, capitalize on the growth drivers on one hand and keep the edge on innovation in the key franchises on the other side.

From a sequence perspective, look, I would say third quarter, we made a pretty deliberate strong investment because we saw the upside coming. You'll see a bit less of that already in the second half. So as I said, you should see leverage on the SG&A line in the second half of the year already. But maybe going into the longer term, look, we've tried to give as much clarity as possible on the gross margin line so that you see the dynamics. If you look at what happened this quarter, we had about 40 basis points of pricing and about 30 basis points or 40 basis points of cost out. That's been sort of a recurring performance over the last quarters, and we expect that to continue over time, right? So we're generating, between those 2 lines, 70 to 80 basis points of gross margin improvement, right?

And this quarter, you had about 80 basis points of negative mix and 20 basis points of tariffs, and that was offset with FX. Going forward, we expect that negative mix to start getting better towards the second half of '27. So for the rest of the year, it's still going to be a pretty significant headwind as CAS and Diabetes continue to accelerate. And in the second half of '27, Diabetes will be deconsolidated. And then on the CAS side, we'll start seeing the shift between the capital equipment and the catheters, which will make that an accretive business as opposed to being dilutive. So what you're going to see there is the 70 to 80 basis points of gross margin improvement operationally start to show up more as the mix becomes a gradually smaller and a positive effect over time.

And then outside of that, we've got some external factors. So we have to contend with the tariffs. So for second half, we've got about 90% of that $185 million of tariffs that's going to show up in the income statement. The bigger portion is in Q3. And then we'll have a carryover of tariffs going into '27. And we expect foreign exchange, which is the last item there to be a slight tailwind going into '27.

So if you go -- it's a long answer, apologies, but I think it's important that you understand the algorithm. Going into '27, we'll keep investing in R&D to get to the 10% over time. But you should expect to see leverage on the SG&A line in '27. So look, we're confident that with the growth, with what we're doing from a gross margin performance in a sustainable fashion in COGS and pricing and the leverage on the overhead, we'll have a leverage P&L on the operating profit line in 2027. And that's why we hold on our commitment to have high single-digit EPS growth going into next year.

Geoffrey Martha
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. And just to add to that, there's more oxygen here to create for the investment. It's begun to see the improved pricing. And as we go forward, we're not assuming much incremental pricing, but at least holding the improved position that we have. But there's more oxygen in our cost down. There's opportunities in scrap, obsolescence and, over time, continuing to optimize our network. So these are areas, I think there's incremental opportunity and cost down.

And Robbie, I've read some of your stuff in the past that you don't think there's much to do for us on SG&A, but there's more. There's more to go on SG&A for the company, and that's where the scale of the company should benefit us here. And it's not going to be easy on the company, but there's opportunities there, and we're committed to doing what it takes to fund these growth drivers, because what we're seeing out there with patients on these different growth drivers and what we're hearing from clinicians, the impact on them and their staff, this is a big opportunity for the company we haven't seen in decades, and we're going to make it happen, right? And so there's still room to go on SG&A as well and, like I said, COGS to make this happen.

Robert Marcus
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. That was a fantastic answer. Maybe just one quick follow-up. Geoff and Thierry, I know even since the beginning of this year, you've talked more and more about tuck-in M&A. How are you thinking about the environment today? Do you see a lot of opportunities? And any areas you see more interesting than others to help flesh out the portfolio?

Geoffrey Martha
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. No, look, we're very focused on the tuck-in M&A. I don't want to tip our hat in terms of exact segments, but we definitely are prioritizing some of the -- again, it's tuck-in. We're prioritizing these higher-growth segments. A lot of that is in Cardiology, some in Neuroscience as well. We like that Affera profile, right, where you're close to market or just you're on the market. Early stage or close to market would be ideal. Not afraid to make the investment that it takes to get those type of companies.

But as Thierry said on your earlier question on like where is the R&D going, the tuck-in M&A, I wouldn't rule out some of our other key franchises that may need to augment their R&D with a little M&A. But we are more focused on these higher-growth segments. And then the Board committees we've set up help with the speed and enable us to move faster. So we'll see where it goes, but it's definitely a big focus.

Thierry Pieton
Executive VP & CFO

One thing that we don't communicate a lot about it, but we've got a pretty active ventures arm, and that arm has been pretty active. So it's got over 50 companies in which we have a stake right now. And we like to use that arm to make investments in sort of early-stage companies, and it helps with some of the dilution, et cetera. Typically, we always make these venture investments with a view of going higher into the capital over time. So it's never venture for venture. And again, it's been -- the pipeline there is pretty strong, and we'll keep working that angle, too, because it's helpful to feed the pipeline for future M&A.

Geoffrey Martha
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes.

Ryan Weispfenning
VP & Head of Investor Relations

Looking at the clock here, I think we've got time for about 3 more questions. So next, we'll go to the line of Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo Securities.

Larry Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Congrats on a nice sprint here. So Geoff, I wanted to ask about the ramp of RDN because as you said, it's a question of how fast. So I'm hoping you can add some precision to your earlier comments. I think at our conference in September, I asked if U.S. RDN sales could replicate the U.S. WATCHMAN ramp, which was about $400 million in year 5. And I believe you said you'd be disappointed if your U.S. RDN sales didn't achieve $400 million by, I believe, year 3. So how does the exclusion of isolated systolic hypertension and the NCD impact how you think about the ramp? And do you still believe you can achieve $400 million U.S. sales by around fiscal 2028, which I think would be year 3? And just confirm, Geoff, that the current run rate in the U.S. is about $50 million.

Geoffrey Martha
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Well, look, let me start by saying, yes, I would be disappointed if we're at year 5, whatever you said, at $400 million. We think it would go faster than that. And the final NCD won't hold us back. And like I said, we believe it's an improvement on the proposed NCD. Maybe this is a good time, because I know there was -- on that NCD, like I said, it's an improvement to the proposed NCD. And if you go back a year, it's better than what we thought a year ago. If you go back 5 years, and you asked us if we thought we would get this type of NCD, we'd say that's the best case scenario.

So this market, like I said, is as big as we said it's going to be. And we believe that this final NCD, as you dig into and really understand how hypertension today is treated, it actually reduces the requirements for patients to get this therapy and it reduces the time. And maybe this is a good time that we have our Chief Scientific and Medical Officer on the line, knowing that there'd be -- Dr. Laura Mauri, who's also an interventional cardiologist, knowing that there'd be maybe some questions on this, on the treatment pathways. Maybe I'll ask Laura to comment since you mentioned that one systolic question -- or diastolic question.

Laura, can you maybe provide some context here?

Laura Mauri
Senior VP and Chief Scientific & Medical Officer

Sure. Larry, specific to your question about isolated systolic hypertension, those are patients who don't have an elevation of their diastolic or the lower number of their blood pressure. It's only the top one. And Geoff said, we're continuing to study those patients. But I think the important thing to note is that this population is actually pretty small for us overall. If you look at recent studies, people with hypertension over age 60, it's less than 15% of patients who have ISH or this condition. And for patients who are younger than 60, who are half of our patients in trials and then also in practice, it's really very unusual.

So as Geoff said, out the gate with the NCD, if you just look at that topic, we would estimate that it would be less than 10% that would be affected by isolated systolic hypertension or not meet those criteria. And then overall, just to reiterate what Geoff said is that the overall -- the final NCD makes access more practical for patients with less time delays to treatment, less restrictions. And the couple of things that they've talked about screening for are really things that are done in standard practice by general practitioners or internists.

And I think the other part just to mention is that in their response, CMS really reiterated that quality of life is a really important consideration for patients, because lifestyle changes and being on many medications can be really difficult. And so they specifically said the good faith attempts are reasonable before referral rather than specifying some like mandatory minimum doses or a number of medications. So overall -- whether it's ISH or, overall, the workflow for patients to get into, referral for Symplicity is really not restricted.

Ryan Weispfenning
VP & Head of Investor Relations

Next, we'll go to the line of Shagun Singh at RBC Capital Markets.

Shagun Singh Chadha
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Great. I wanted to touch on the financial algorithm. A key message was growth acceleration. How should we think about the base business? Is it mid-single digits? The $1 billion incremental PFA sales is about 300 basis points. And then RDN, I don't know if you could put a finer point there in terms of the growth contribution. But as you think about growth acceleration, should we think about Medtronic moving towards that high single digit on the top line? And then on portfolio management, I was just wondering how you're thinking about or should we expect portfolio pruning beyond Diabetes?

Geoffrey Martha
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Shagun, thanks for the question. I'll start with the last part of it on the portfolio management. And look, this is an ongoing focus for the company. And it's really making sure that beyond Diabetes, right -- first of all, that deal is tracking and it's on track and going well. But beyond Diabetes, we just want to make sure that the whole portfolio fits together. We're getting the right amount of synergies, and we can provide the right amount of focus on these generational enterprise growth drivers like PFA, like RDN, like Altaviva and Hugo when it comes to the U.S. and others. And so it's still -- it remains a focus, and it remains a focus of like one of the Board committees that we set up, and we're meeting frequently on this and looking at it. And that's what I'll say there. And then I'll have Thierry answer...

Thierry Pieton
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Look, overall, if you think about the guidance that we just gave, 5.5% on the full year, we were at 5.2% at the end of the first half, we're guiding at 5.5% in the third quarter. So you can do the math for what fourth quarter looks like, and we don't want to slow down from there. And look, what I would say is it's pretty clear that CAS represents a sizable opportunity. We reiterate the incremental $1 billion coming shortly, probably in the beginning of fiscal year '27 for us.

And RDN, we have all these discussions about the speed, et cetera, but I think it's important to keep in mind that 1% of market share in that population is sort of almost $3 billion of revenue for us. So it's a pretty significant opportunity. And we talked about the size of the Altaviva opportunity as well. It's 20 million patients overall. So those come in increment to the rest of the business, and the rest of the business is not standing still. So Specialty Therapies is getting better. You saw first sign in this quarter, and it's going to keep going with the product activity that we've got in Neurovascular with Altaviva and Pelvic.

And the key franchises, look, CRM had a great quarter. It's going to continue to perform for the rest of the year and beyond. We're investing in that business to keep the technology lead. So we don't intend to go backwards. CST has been improving on the back of the AiBLE ecosystem that the team has created. So look, we're positive about the opportunities of the company going forward, and we'll keep you posted when we give next year's guidance at the end of Q4.

Ryan Weispfenning
VP & Head of Investor Relations

We've got time for one more question, and I apologize to the analysts that we weren't able to get to. If you've got additional questions, feel free to reach out to me during the day. So we'll go to our last question, Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank.

Pito Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I have sort of 2 product questions, so I'll ask them upfront. The first one is, as AF ablations move into the ASC setting, can you talk about how you are positioned in ASC in terms of mappers and Affera placements? And on TAVR, can you talk about what you saw in the U.S., Europe and Japan, and how market share is looking in those markets?

Geoffrey Martha
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Well, thanks, Pito. Look, for PFA and ASCs, over time, we do see that as an incremental opportunity for market expansion there. There will be a bit of a shift outside of the tertiary centers to the ASCs over time, but it will also be a market expansion opportunity for us. It is a focus for us. We have been hiring across the company, quite frankly, particularly in Neuroscience and in Cardiovascular, folks that are specifically focused on market development in the ASCs for us and what our strategy is and how our product portfolio fits there and the resources we need, including mappers. So this definitely is in the calculus for Medtronic, not just our Cardiac Ablation business. Like I said, I think this will represent an incremental growth opportunity for us there.

And then on TAVR, what I'll say is we had a decent Q2 here, growing high single digits on a global basis. Internationally, we're executing particularly well and getting more than our fair share of that Boston exit. As we move forward in PFA (sic) [ TAVR ], I think Q3, we may see a deceleration there.

Thierry Pieton
Executive VP & CFO

In TAVR.

Geoffrey Martha
Chairman of the Board & CEO

TAVR. What did I say?

Thierry Pieton
Executive VP & CFO

PFA.

Geoffrey Martha
Chairman of the Board & CEO

PFA, I'm sorry. In TAVR, a little bit of a deceleration in Q3, but then it will pop back up in Q4. Due to a phasing, we've seen this in prior quarters as well. I don't know if you want to add anything to that?

Thierry Pieton
Executive VP & CFO

No, that's right. We saw the Q4, Q1 effect and Q2, Q3 looks kind of similar, a little bit slower in Q3, but with a pickup in the fourth quarter.

Geoffrey Martha
Chairman of the Board & CEO

And just for clarity, PFA, will continue to grow off the 71% and it will accelerate in Q3 and beyond.

Ryan Weispfenning
VP & Head of Investor Relations

Geoff, if you want to go ahead with your closing remarks?

Geoffrey Martha
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Sure. So thank you for joining and all your thoughtful questions this morning. And like Ryan said, I apologize to the analysts we didn't get to. We certainly appreciate your support and your interest in Medtronic. Please join us again for our Q3 earnings broadcast for more updates, and there'll be more on our continued progress and on the long-term strategies. And we expect to hold this on Tuesday, February 17. And for those of you in the U.S., I wish you and your families a very happy Thanksgiving next week. I can't believe Thanksgiving is next week.

With that, enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.
