[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Chappell with Evercore ISI.

Jonathan Chappell
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Jim, I'm going to give you a break and go to Jennifer first today. Jennifer, I know there's a lot of moving parts and you got to know, where you end up in '25 in a different manner than you expected 12 months ago. But just help us understand a little bit. You said price may not be a driver of improving margins in '26, given the accelerated inflation. You talked about 4% on the comp per employee. You're not expecting a macro recovery. So how do you get to OR improvement in '26? Is this a function of headcount, productivity? And if there's any way to frame the magnitude based on what you see today and what Kenny laid out from a macro standpoint, that would be helpful.

Jennifer Hamann
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks for that question, Jonathan. So you heard that right in terms of -- from what we're expecting today, at least as we sit here from a price standpoint that while we absolutely believe that we will and have a plan to improve our operating ratio in 2026, we don't think that we're going to get any help from price. Of course, that's an early look.

And really, it's a function of a couple of things. We definitely benefited in 2025 from natural gas prices and strong coal pricing. While that may hold, we're just not going to have that as a tailwind for us in 2026. And then you still have a pretty weak domestic intermodal market. And those two things really are what's reflected in that pricing commentary.

In terms of productivity, Eric and his team did a fantastic job in 2025, driving productivity, driving efficiency, and we have more ahead of us in 2026. And so that definitely will be a continued tailwind for us as we move into 2026. And that's going to be supportive of improving our margins.

And then the last thing I'll mention is the business mix. It should be a more favorable business mix for us in 2026 than in 2025. Now we were a little off in '25. I thought it was going to be a better mix in 2025 than it ended up being. But you still saw us make margin improvement. So that's where I think just the way that we're running and executing today, it's a huge benefit for us. We are moving every available carload there is, and I anticipate we'll continue to do that in 2026. So that's really how we're looking at it.

Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.

Andrzej Tomczyk
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

It's Andrzej on for Jordan. I was just curious if you could dig a little more in on the $2 billion of targeted net revenue gains from the expected merger. I think about $4.2 billion of the increased traffic gains are being offset by $2.2 billion of costs associated with handling that traffic. The question is how variable can that $4 billion gross traffic number be based on your planning assumptions?

And then could you just discuss a little more related to how you project the associated costs of taking on that new traffic, which altogether, I think it implies a pretty healthy EBITDA margin for the potential new traffic coming on board.

Vincenzo Vena
CEO & Director

So if I have your question right, you're asking us when we put the merger application in, we talked about growth in the number of -- the carload growth. And you want to know if that's conservative, or not, or where the market is. And you also want to understand whether -- how we're going to handle that business.

So let's split that up in two pieces. We had experts -- we looked at it before, of course, before we decided to cross the bridge and merge with Norfolk Southern, we did our own analysis of the traffic that's available both long-haul, intermodal that today, we have a lower percentage than the mid-length intermodal business just because of the handoff of what happens when you have to hand off from one railroad to the other and it just does not open the market and penetrate it as well. So we're very comfortable that, that $2 million that we put into the application is there.

And in fact, we are and always have been, just like when we talked about price before, we're conservative. If anybody thinks we're going to let Kenny get away with being conservative internally than dream on and you don't know who I am, okay? So the same thing with this. We're very comfortable.

And then we had experts look at the market, and they wrote in their best guesstimate or estimate at this point on what we're going to do. Any time you increase business, you get the added on the trains that you have and what you need to do. So it's always much more efficient than running traffic that is in a decreasing position where you have to try to figure out how to adjust your network. So bottom line is, I'm very comfortable that the business is out there.

Now there has been some talk about this business. It's $2 million and my God, how much is that. Well, if you do the math, it's just -- it's around 38,000 carloads. You have to remember the way we -- all of us count intermodal. So you can just about cut some of that in half because there's two containers at least on a railcar. And for us, we load up our trains. Also, we don't run 10,000-foot trains. We run our intermodal package because we have built the system to be able to do that somewhere between 14,000 and 18,000 feet. And we do that every day, and we've been doing it for now the last few years. So the total number of additional movements that we're going to have on the railroad, that impact what capital we need to require is not as large as people think, and we know that it's not that large.

Let me take one more step down if you take a look at the way we operate. The way we operate is, this morning, when I looked, okay, like I do every morning, we have over 2,000 movements, foreign railroad, local trains running on our network. So if we add 10 more trains a day, or 15 or 14 more trains a day, it's a pretty small rounding error on the impact to the network. So I'm very comfortable that when the merger gets finalized, which it will, just because of the enhanced product that we're offering our customers. And just an end-to-end railroad from one end of the country to the other is enhanced all by itself. We're going to be able to provide seamless, faster service to our customers, let alone in the watershed.

So Eric, do you have anything more to talk about how the network is going to handle this little bit of business that we're going to bring on that we hopefully is more than $2 million.

Eric Gehringer
Executive Vice President of Operations

Yes, let's build on that where you started. So really, we're talking about a 6% increase in our operating inventory and at the combined entity. And I want everybody to make sure you hear that 6%. So you have three things you do.

Number one, you rely on the buffer of capacity we already have, right? We've talked all the time internally and externally about the fact that we keep a buffer of resources for locomotives and cars. But we also do that for terminal capacity and mainline capacity. We don't run terminals up to 100% capacity. Heck, when we get to about 80%, we're already making investments.

Second thing, when you look at the application, the base year is 2023. So we've made capacity investments. And independently, NS has made capacity investments as well in '23, '24 and '25, and those are all tailwinds for us to utilize. And then Jim hit the last one. I got to be honest with you, I totally agree with Jim, when -- I don't remember what railroad said it, but something about 10,000 feet. And I had a hard time computing that because we don't run trains at 10,000 feet. Here at Union Pacific, we've invested in our people and the technology that allows us to safely and reliably operate those trains to the length Jim mentioned.

So I'm very comfortable with it. We're working through the integration process, and it will be the most thoroughly planned and executed integration of two railroads.

Vincenzo Vena
CEO & Director

Listen, sorry for the long answer. We'll try to be shorter. So this thing doesn't go too long, but great question. Thank you very much.

The next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.

Ken Hoexter
BofA Securities, Research Division

Great job on the ops. I guess just a quick one, just to clarify, the base rate for your mid-single-digit growth, is that the $11.98 reported? Or is it the normalized? I'm just get of a lot of questions on that.

And then premerger, you're now building to low single digit, mid-single digit into 2027. Maybe you can just kind of -- are we really ramping that up for the '27 outlook? And kind of what should expectations? I know it's 1 year or 2 years ahead, but just because you've reiterated that target, I just want to understand your thoughts there, in the face of $3.8 billion down to $3.3 billion CapEx. So why the reduction and what's getting pulled out?

Jennifer Hamann
Executive VP & CFO

Well, for one question, Ken, you managed to hit a lot of points there. Let me see if I can hit them all.

So our guide of mid-single digits is off of the $11.98. Our reported EPS, which was up 8% year-over-year in 2025. You also asked in terms of the CapEx piece at the end there. We are sizing our CapEx relative to what the network needs. And Jim has talked about this before. CapEx isn't just a snapshot in time. It's not a single year. These are multiyear investments. Eric mentioned some of the investments that we're making in and around Houston. That's over $300 million in total, but that's going to be over many years. So we're looking ahead. We're looking at what we have ahead of us in terms of what we need, and we feel very comfortable with that.

What was your middle question? I missed that one.

Ken Hoexter
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just the -- sorry, the middle part of it was the ramp into the low, mid-single digit into 2027.

Vincenzo Vena
CEO & Director

Conservative for this year.

Jennifer Hamann
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean, you're right, mathematically, that does put a lot of pressure on 2027. Again, we're sitting here on January 27. It's tough to know exactly what's going to happen. The economic indicators don't look great, but if that's different, we're positioned. We have the resources, and we're going to capitalize on that, absolutely. The market is not telling us that's available today, but the market is often wrong. And seeing ahead to 2027, again, continue to run well, and we feel very comfortable with the guide, even though that does mean if we're right in the mid-single digits for 2026, that puts a big lift on 2027 for us.

Vincenzo Vena
CEO & Director

And we stopped the share buyback of $4 billion to $5 billion, right? $ 4 billion, $4.5 billion this year. So just because we're making sure that we have the cash, as Jennifer spoke about. And Ken, you should know me by now and you should know this team, we'd rather be a little conservative in what we -- how we look at it and make sure that we over deliver on what we have, and that's our challenge all the time. So Ken, good question. Thank you very much.

Your next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein.

David Vernon
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

So a bigger picture question for you around some of the access issues. Obviously, the regulator came out with the decision to maybe change some of the rules around switching. I'm not going to call it reciprocal because it's only reciprocal if two parties are involved. But if you think about the switching sort of regulation moving away from maybe the Midtec Paper precedent, how does that change your perspective on the business? Or what kind of impact do you expect that to have as we think about a future either with or without the merger, if we're going to maybe make it a little bit easier for shippers to petition for a switch, how does that change the UP business? We've been getting a lot of questions on that from investors. I'd love to get your thoughts on it.

Vincenzo Vena
CEO & Director

Yes. Listen, I think it's a timely question, David. I appreciate it. Anybody who's heard me for the last son of a gun, okay? I was at CN 10 years ago. So I was on calls 12, 13 years ago. I've been very consistent, and I haven't changed. I'm all about competition, and that's what I love about this merger, it's going to make everybody more competitive, and it's going to drive better results for our customers. But on that issue, I am not afraid to compete. And I think customers should have optionality.

In general, the devil is in the details, okay? With what they've put out, and we have to work through. But I am very supportive of if you can't deliver for your customers, then customers should have optionality. And I have no issue with that. Now it needs to be across the whole industry, not just, okay, Union Pacific. It has to be for everybody. I would love to compete with some customers that are not getting the service level we're providing in the Western U.S., and when we have the merger in the Eastern U.S., or with the Canadian railroads that are running north-south, okay, through and into Iowa. We'd love to compete against them, and we have no issue opening some of our customers up or all of them up as long as everybody does.

So that's where I'm at with it. The devil is in the details. And let's make sure that whatever happens actually improves the customer experience. The worst thing you can do is have a system in place that is complicated, no one understands how the customer can win. If you increase touch points and you make it complicated, then the customer actually sees a deterioration. They're going to have to carry more inventory and more assets to try to move through it. So as long as we protect the investments that we've made, okay, to provide service to our customers. Just in Inglewood, hundreds of millions of dollars to have the buffer in there to be able to recover as fast as we have.

So I'm all for it. I like it. Let's get through the details. And I've told everybody, the regulators that wanted to listen to me, long before anybody put anything out and this last one that I would be supportive. Now I don't think everybody is on the same page. But if they are, it should be an easy fix to go ahead and get it done. I'm ready and Union Pacific is ready to challenge ourselves. And the cream rises to the top when you have more competition.

So David, hopefully, I helped you with that answer, and you're clear about where we are on it.

David Vernon
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

You absolutely did. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. Do you have a date for when the application is going to be resubmitted. I'm not sure if that filing has been in yet, but I think the STB had asked you guys to let them know when the resubmit was going on?

Vincenzo Vena
CEO & Director

Okay. I've been having an exciting morning watching the railroad recover. Then you ask me a question like that. I'm telling you we got experts working on stuff, and trying to get all these experts to give me all the detail. We're working on sort of a sliding scale right now. I don't like it. I wish it was in tomorrow, but they're working hard, and this is weeks.

And this was why we started with trying to get the application in way before the full 6 months because I was absolutely sure even though we thought we had done a good job that the STB was going to find something that they wanted us to look at it again. And I understand why. This is a big combination. This needs to be done right. And I give the STB credit that they're going to look at it. I think the 3 members plus all the people at the STB, they have a responsibility to make sure that what we're doing is positive.

They're going to come to the same conclusion as I have and the entire team here in Norfolk Southern has that it is positive. It is positive for customers, for our employees, for America, taking trucks off the road. But at the end of the day, it's a process, frustrating as it is, okay? Once in a while, I go home and I have a nice Irish whiskey to calm myself down before I go to bed, just to say, okay, I'm good with this. But stay tuned.

As soon as we know exactly the date, I'll be the first one to announce it. I think we'll put a press release out that says that in March on whatever date it's going to come out. So sorry, I can't give you a definitive one this morning, but you know I'm pushing them hard to get this thing done.

The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo.

Christian Wetherbee
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I guess, maybe as it relates to the merger and the competitive landscape, obviously, there's a lot of customer relationships that need to be addressed as you go through this process. I know it's relatively early, but with the application in, people have had a chance to look at it, get a sense of how you're thinking about it, you'll have obviously more comments to come as you just noted, Jim. I guess maybe specifically on the intermodal side, can you talk to us about how that sort of discussion is developing. There's obviously some big partners that are not on your railroad in the West, but maybe would be on the combined railroad in the East. I just kind of get a sense of maybe how that discussion sort of looks right now and maybe how we should think about those relationships evolving in 2026? What's embedded in your outlook on volume?

Vincenzo Vena
CEO & Director

Let me pass it over to Kenny here in 1 minute, but let me just say this. We've had discussions with customers from bulk customers, from customers that are single car movers, customers that are chemical, customers that are moving industrial products that need to move. And every one of the customers that I've spoken with have, they understand it. They see the benefit. Are they concerned? What they're always concerned about is, will Union Pacific? And they should be, okay? That should be a question they ask and they've asked me that question is, are you going to be able to keep the service level up with the combined railroad, and are you going to impact me? Because they remember Canadian Pacific's shemozzle with their IT system. And I tell them that, listen, with net control, what we did was -- it's the fundamental base of everything that feeds into the railroad. We did it and it was a non-event.

I've also been railroading for 47 years. And at the end of the day, it's really important and for me, it's real important. Whether it was when I was in Vancouver, and we were getting rid of those 4-hour quits that people were having, we did it in a way so that customers don't see the impact. So that's really important to me.

And with that, I think the feedback is, if you can provide me good service, they see the benefit and they see the pressure. This is going to put on the other railroads to compete. And Chris, it's pretty simple, if you can't compete on service, if you can't win and be faster across the country, and across when we extend by 200 to 300 miles, customers on the east side of the Mississippi and customers on the west side of the Mississippi that can get further into the Ohio Valley, or people from the east can get into Texas easier or into California easier, they're going to have to compete on price. So I think the pressure is not going to be on customers, they're going to see much more competition as we move ahead.

But Kenny, you've had lots of discussions with people, and why don't you give Chris a little bit of more background and color.

Kenny Rocker
Executive Vice President of Marketing & Sales

Yes, Chris, I think Jim hit it across the board. All of our customers not just intermodal, but let's talk about intermodal, and we're pretty excited about it. As you know, Hub has come out, Swift has come out, ONE has come out. And what those intermodal customers see are the investments that Eric and this management team have made, we've talked about them with Inland Empire, Phoenix, Twin Cities. The service is strong. I talked about it in my results today, wow, we're coming from a place of strength being able to have our best-ever domestic intermodal business. And we talked about it in all 2025, over-the-road wins with Uber, over-the-road wins in Phoenix, over-the-road wins in the Kansas City. So we're coming from a position of strength, and we're excited about it.

Christian Wetherbee
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Shemozzle is a pretty good one, Jim.

Vincenzo Vena
CEO & Director

I don't know how the hell you spell that, I'll leave it to you, Chris.

Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets.

Walter Spracklin
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

So if I start on operating ratio, if I look at your operating metrics, Jim, they look really good. I mean lengths like Eric highlighted, are at record levels, velocity record levels. When I see that kind of operating performance, my inclination is to kind of improve your operating ratio fairly not by a little bit, maybe 100 basis points or more. But I'm curious as to Jennifer made some comments about pricing and -- or sorry, inflation and how pricing won't be a contributor. Do you need pricing? Do you need volume to get north of 100 basis points? Or can you do that through those metrics that you're hitting right now without help from macro or price?

Vincenzo Vena
CEO & Director

Walter, you are a smart guy. You've been around for a long time and you understand this. You need -- you use a whole bunch of levers when we look at operating ratio, and that's a result of everything that we do. So we will continue to look at how we can operate better and how we can operate more efficiently. And you could see the work that was done by Eric and the entire operating team on productivity.

Some things are given to us. Whether I liked it or not, when I showed up this time came back to work, we signed a collective agreement that increased wages substantially for our employees. And then this time, okay, one of the parties went out fast and signed a pattern agreement that we've had to live with. Now we have agreements with everybody, but that includes a 4% wage increase, okay, first year. So at the end of the day, that's the pressure we have. Now Kenny needs to deliver on price, okay? We're talking about price and saying where it is right now, but it's unacceptable if Kenny and the marketing team think that their job is to -- for the value we give customers to understand the marketplace and price it properly.

So Walter, I'm very comfortable that we're going to be able to improve our OR this year. Jennifer is always much more conservative than me. And that's okay. That's where she should be, okay? She's the person that puts it all on paper and gives us the numbers. If I gave you my number, it would be scary, but I'm not going to give it to you. But I think I'm very comfortable where we are, Walter. And Walter, I got to say it, like thank God, I'm not in Winnipeg. When I saw minus 38, I was thinking of, like I felt bad for those people at Canadian National. Like let me tell you, they are tough. But hopefully, I answered your question.

Operator

The next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen.

Elliot Alper
TD Cowen, Research Division

This is Elliot Alper on for Jason Seidl. I wanted to ask about the 2026 outlook. Can you speak to the volume and pricing assumptions within your guidance? I know you're pricing in excess of that 4% inflation number. But can you speak to maybe how customers are absorbing new contracts given the muted customer demand you're seeing and kind of the expectations for the year?

Jennifer Hamann
Executive VP & CFO

Kenny, can give you the color, but let me just remind you what I said exactly. And we're not giving specific numbers as to volumes other than that we do plan to outperform the markets. On the price side, we said that our price dollars in an absolute basis will exceed our inflation dollars. So that's an important nuance. We are not talking about it in percentages, it's absolute dollars. So Kenny take it away.

Kenny Rocker
Executive Vice President of Marketing & Sales

Yes. So last year around this time, we laid out macroeconomic indicators. And we said at that time, they were mixed. And then in 2025, we put up a record year in freight revenue. So I just want to say that. So we know we can win in a difficult environment. And we know we have some commodities that are going to -- we'll have to really go after like forest and lumber. We'll see how that plays out. Automotive, we'll see how that plays out. But you look across the board in construction, as the weather was good, we had a banner-remarkable year. Plastics banner-remarkable year. Industrial chemicals banner-remarkable year. Grain products banner-remarkable year.

So in all three phases, we've been able to grow in a difficult environment. We're committed to that. We've got a strong service product. And so with that, we're going to gather the demand that's out there, maximize the price based on the service that we have, and we'll see where that lands us.

Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.

Scott Group
Wolfe Research, LLC

So Jim, we've got the STB decision on the application. They sort of had a comment, "Hey, if you want to improve the overall application, go for it." We've got a lots of other comments from other rails, some other stakeholders. I guess, has your degree of confidence in approval here changed in any way? And ultimately, what is giving you so much confidence in approval here?

Vincenzo Vena
CEO & Director

So Scott, if this was a bad deal, if this truly was not better for our customers, better for our employees, then you know what, you'd be speaking, but no one would listen and no one would see the facts. This combination is compelling. It changes the dynamic and the competition. And remember, fundamentally, railroads, the other railroads can say what they have to say, and they're very vocal about it, but they're complaining because they're worried about competing against us because no business would ever, ever complain if somebody in their marketplace was doing something stupid.

If you were offering really bad coffee across the street, you go over there and try it out, you check out all their business processes, you check and see how their app is, you check and see how their payment is, and you can check and see how there is. And if they were really bad, I don't know, maybe the rest of them wouldn't do that in our industry, but I would tell the owner of that coffee shop across the street from my coffee shop, I'm telling you your coffee is the best, okay? I wouldn't complain.

I'd only complain, and I'd go back worried if the product they had was better than mine. And I have to do what I have to do. So bottom line is that's why I'm very confident. And it's not just Jim Vena that's confident. It's speaking to the people in Norfolk Southern, they see the benefit. They understand it. And that's good to have because we're going to be merging these two companies together. So I'm very confident that at the end of the day, going through this process, and is it painful? If this was the Jim Vena's STB, I would get that decision done by my birthday, okay, this summer. But this is not Jim Vena's, okay, STB, we need to go through the process. We knew it was going to be long and thorough and so be it, okay? I wish it was thorough and shorter, but you know what, it is what it is. So we'll deal with that as we go.

So Scott, very comfortable with it. And we're going in to answer the questions that they asked us when they gave us the response. One of the things they asked us to do is give our red line of where we're going to -- where we have, and any big deal has that optionality to say to the buyer, the company that's going to spend $85 billion in stock and cash, at what point you could actually walk away. And we never thought that was material in looking at the merits of the business and whether it made sense to put the railroads together, and we didn't provide it. The STB wants it, we'll give it. I have no idea what the other railroads are going to do with it. Maybe they'll scurry home and take a look at it and see what they can do to figure out how they can get close to that number where our walk away is, but I don't understand it against the merits.

So we'll answer the key questions. We'll make sure we do it right. And if we have more information, and we can add something in the merger as we put in the refreshed merger application, we'll do that. But that's where we are with it, Scott.

Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS.

Thomas Wadewitz
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So I wanted to ask you about your thought process, while we're in this approval phase. You talked about maybe first half of '27. It might be like maybe implied more even for what happens with Norfolk, but I would guess you have maybe some thoughts on kind of combined strategy. So how do you approach volume? I think Norfolk had seen some volume shift over to CSX on J.B. Hunt. I don't know if there's any risk to your volume. But do you think volume as you're in this kind of broader approval phase before you can run the railroad combined? Do you say, hey, we got to be aggressive on volume and kind of win volume back, or get as much volume as we can? Or is this like, hey, we don't need to be too aggressive because when we got the combined railroad, then we're going to really go out there and win.

Vincenzo Vena
CEO & Director

Listen, I can't tell Norfolk Southern what to do, okay? And I'm not going to say it publicly because I just can't. And it would be illegal for me to tell them what to do. But I'll tell you what we're doing at Union Pacific. We are looking to grow our business, and that's what we're going to do in 2026. We're looking for every opportunity. When you serve a customer that gives you 30 railcars and they're served also by another railroad in Texas, we want -- if our service level is high and our pricing is so good, then we would expect them to give us 32 cars and 33 cars. So we're going out to grow our business.

And if you take a look at the way we handled the Canadian Pacific merger with Kansas City, I think we've done an excellent job of growing our business in and out of Mexico, even though they have a seamless railroad going in. The true numbers are, we've done a spectacular job with FXE and with Canadian Pacific. We still ship with Canadian Pacific into Mexico, and we ship with the FXE into Mexico, both northbound and southbound, so that's the way I look at it, Tom, is this year, the merger is one thing, but the fundamental of what we need to do to operate the railroad and grow our business and increase price for the value we're giving and looking at the markets and what we have to do and what's possible.

And sometimes, we've got to drop price, and we've done that this year with some of our commodities. That are single served because of the marketplace and what they were competing on. And I've mentioned it publicly, we've had to do that with the soda ash is because of what's happening with our competitors that are from China with synthetic soda ash. So at the end of the day, that's where we are. I expect Kenny to grow the freaking business. Otherwise, why do I need a marketing department? I expect Eric to deliver improvements in productivity. Otherwise, why do I need a freaking operating department headed up by Eric.

And he's doing a good job. Gentlemen, you guys are doing good, don't get me wrong. This is not me putting you on the hot seat. And Jennifer, you better freaking deliver too, okay? So at the end of it, that's where we are, okay? So hopefully, I gave you a clear view of the way I look at it.

Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Jim, I guess, can you put in context the proposed rule-making change the STB made on reciprocal switching and dropping the requirement to prove anticompetitive behavior. And especially in the context of like your open access gateway proposal and the merger as well. Appreciate it.

Vincenzo Vena
CEO & Director

Okay. Well, listen, I need to get these guys into it also a little bit. And Kenny, why don't you tell people what our position is on reciprocal switching or some open access, okay?

Kenny Rocker
Executive Vice President of Marketing & Sales

Yes. I think you hit it up early in the question. I think Jonathan Chappell asked it, but when you look at our service product being the way it is, we're not afraid to compete. I said that in our words, we've been able to grow again. We want to expand the pie. We're not looking at just rail-to-rail competition. We're trying to go after over the road. We've been emphasizing that. I've shared earlier, best-ever domestic intermodal, growth on the international side on the over-the-road from some of the ports going back east.

We're looking at expanding the pie and we're doing that through the investments. We've invested in Twin Cities. We've invested in Kansas City. We've invested in the Gulf Coast also on the carload business. You've seen us show optionality, Jim and also Brandon, and where we normally might have gone to the West Coast or PNW on the grain business, we pivoted down to Mexico. So we're looking to go out there and compete regardless.

There was another part of the question in terms of the gateways and keeping those open. Our customers demand optionality. We want our customers to have optionality. There's no case where we go out, and we would not want to provide optionality for our customers.

Vincenzo Vena
CEO & Director

So Eric, are you afraid of competing if we had reciprocal switching or some sort of access as long as it's fair, as long as the details work to make the customer better. If we don't deliver, somebody else should. So how is your feeling on that?

Eric Gehringer
Executive Vice President of Operations

No fear at all, but I'm going to focus on the back half of what you said. And Brandon, we talked about this to Kenny's point a little bit earlier. When you start thinking about reciprocal switching, what you have to be really cognizant of is what is the experience the customer is going to have. And you can horribilize it, and I'm not going to horribilize it. But even in your average scenario, if it's not designed properly, that car or that collection of cars that the second carrier is now handling, they're going to be in a terminal at least for 1 day or 2. And so now you've added somewhere between, say, 20 and 50 hours of dwell to that car.

That's not what customers want. At least that's not what our customers want. Our customers want us to seamlessly pick up the car, take it to our terminal, process through it quickly, like our record dwell in the fourth quarter of 19.8 hours and get it an outbound train. So how we design this, in fact, specifically how the STB designs this, we need to make sure that we're really cognizant of is it achieving the ultimate goal of our customers, which is to be able to deliver the transit time that they promised their customers.

Vincenzo Vena
CEO & Director

And if I can add one thing is -- and we've done it. So we've worked with customers to build in. And in fact, we have two places that we're going through the process to get three places. Jennifer, that's right. You're right. Three places that we are in the process of going through the regulatory environment to be able to build in, where customers are single-served, and we're willing to spend our money.

And that's the way it should be. Business should not be, you get a freebie from somebody else. Like, I don't know, I'd have a hard time if I had a coffee shop, and I love coffee. And I'm short of coffee this morning. I need a double espresso. But at the end of the day, if I had a coffee shop and somebody wants to set up in my coffee shop to sell their coffee. If you want to have a freaking coffee shop, build one across the street, build the next door to me, do whatever. So at the end of the day, I'm not afraid to compete. We're -- in fact, I think it would be an advantage for Union Pacific and the merged Norfolk Southern Union Pacific to have open access. We even put more pressure on our competitors, okay? To be able to win in the marketplace. If we can have a real high level of service, which we have.

But on top of that, if we need to spend money, son of a gun, some of the railroads, our competitors have huge amount of money put aside. They could build into just about anywhere if they wanted to. So that's the way I look at it. It's about competition. This is not your grandmother's railroad that's afraid and protective. Somebody wants to go through New Orleans because that's the quickest way to get to the Southeast and into Florida. We want to go there. If you don't, what you end up doing is you lose the business. Eventually, somebody comes from overseas to take that market away from you. And we've seen that in places where people get protectionists. We're not protectionist.

But I'm telling you, we didn't like the last time the STB came up with a way to do service and access. It was so freaking complicated. All we were going to do was hire lawyers to try to figure out how to do that. And I I've got this love-hate relationship with lawyers, okay? I love them somethings and some of the times they bother the heck out of me. But at the end of the day, we're here to compete, and I have no problem if we have something that provides service, higher service for our customers, and we'll win. And they'll pay us for that service if we provide the service that makes them better and they can win in the marketplace. We need to partner with more and more of them as we go.

So listen, gentlemen, thank you very much. Sorry again for the long answer, but you got me going on, on this issue. So thank you.

Brandon Oglenski
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Thanks, Jim. Sorry if it was a duplicate question.

Vincenzo Vena
CEO & Director

Oh, don't worry about it. I love it because you need to reinforce things 10 times. So that was not a shot against you about the question. I loved it. We probably weren't clear the first time. So don't worry about that at all, okay?

Next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies.

Stephanie Benjamin Moore
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Well, being based in Nashville here, we're pretty iced in. So if UNP is back up and running by Thursday, then I hope you can say the same for my household. So that's pretty impressive.

But I did want to return -- yes. No, it's pretty impressive. I did want to maybe return to the pricing conversation. Look, considering how strong the network is performing and the value you are providing for customers, can you talk a little bit about the pricing opportunity going forward for you guys? I mean, is there something that needs to happen from an industry standpoint to bolster pricing? Is this just a function of an improving freight backdrop? And then how is UNP specifically positioned post merger as well?

Kenny Rocker
Executive Vice President of Marketing & Sales

Stephanie, I'm glad that you asked the question. So we've got two structural things that are going on and Jennifer talk to both of them. On the coal side, we've got some mechanisms in the contract that helped us out a little bit in 2025, and we see that as -- we'll see what happens with that going forward. And then the same thing we've talked about this now, we're talking 3 years in terms of domestic intermodal and where the rates are from that level, and we haven't seen the pricing uplift there.

Now I get to make this pretty crystal clear. We have the mindset with this service product that we are pricing to those levels. We have the mindset that has not -- we haven't backed away or changed anything on how we're looking at the pricing. We have those two structural things that we talked about. Outside of those, the teams are doing a very good job, sitting down with customers, sharing the service product that they have and talking about opening up new markets for growth and/or on the renewal. So there is no change whatsoever. I need to make sure we're all on the same page on that.

Vincenzo Vena
CEO & Director

And service drives price.

Kenny Rocker
Executive Vice President of Marketing & Sales

Service drives price. And I said that we're consistent with that.

Vincenzo Vena
CEO & Director

So hurry up.

Jennifer Hamann
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And rail is still more price competitive than truck.

Vincenzo Vena
CEO & Director

And rail is more price competitive than truck. Yes. Thank you very much. Thanks for the question.

The next question is from the line of Ariel Rosa with Citigroup.

Ariel Rosa
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

So I know a number of people have asked about reciprocal switching, but I actually wanted to broaden the question out a little bit more. Just if we could talk about the relationship between the Class 1s and the STB, I don't know if you would agree with this. I know you've been railroading a long time. It seems to me that over the last 20, 25 years or so, the STB has been relatively hands off with the rails as long as service has been pretty good. But now as we think about kind of transcontinental mergers, just the scale of the rails post-UPNS, assuming it goes through, is there anything that concerns you where the STB might say just given the size of the railroads in that scenario that the STB says, we need to be more proactive. We need to be more aggressive in our regulatory approach and how we think about protecting customer interests.

And I guess, is there anything -- I know you said, obviously, competition doesn't concern you, but is there anything that would concern you where you would say, okay, that's a step too far, or that's something that the STB could do that would kind of impede our ability to hit our synergy targets or that would erode margins kind of structurally over the long term?

Vincenzo Vena
CEO & Director

The answer is no, but let me give you a little bit more feedback. So Ari, and I know you set me up to help me with this question, and I think it's a wonderful question. People think about the railroad and the regulatory environment, and they're thinking back to the 1890s, okay? 1900 when there was no highway system. There was -- vehicles were just starting to be manufactured. There was some trucks. So the competition was railroad against railroad was the key way and boats using water to be able to move products. If you actually move to today, we have -- if you look only in the railroad, you could say that we have x amount of business. But if you actually look at all the business, everything that's moved, railroads have a pretty small percentage of the total business that's out there that's being moved.

So our competitor is trucks and vessels and international vessels coming in with competition. It is Brazil, moving products into the largest soybean crushing facility, which is in Ragasa, okay, which is in Mexico, and that's our competition. So at the end of the day, we have to stop thinking about the railroads. And if we end up with 38% or 40% of the total market, and we hope to grow it. But if that's where we end up, it's a small piece.

The other thing is, and this is real philosophically, real important. Listen, the other railroads, we're going back and forth lots. They're smart people that operate those other railroads, okay? I know a lot of people in the other railroads, and they're smart people, and we should be proud as a nation that with all the regulations and everything that we do from safety and everything else, we would -- I would put the railroads in the United States of America up against and in North America up against anybody. No one has a railroad that can move a product at the price we move it and how safe we move it as an industry.

So we can go back and forth. That's just normal business. I don't know why it's part of the railroad business. I don't know why they're doing it now because they're afraid to compete against us. We're going to have a stronger competitor. But at the end of the day, I think the regulators know they can't wreck this industry. If they wreck this industry by over -- by making it overcomplicated, trucks are getting more efficient. They know ifs, ands, or buts, and I use Waymo as an example, but there's trucks out there running right now to see how they can automate and have less people with more products in a truck, okay, or multiple trucks. That's our true competition, and that's where we have to win.

So STB are bright people, okay? I've got to know Patrick a little bit. I can't talk to them very much anymore just because of they're going through this merger plus the other two, okay? Michelle and Karen. But at the end of the day, they're smart. They know they don't want to wreck the industry, but we also have to look forward and quick looking backwards to 1890 or a merger that happened in 1995, okay? I had black curly hair, big mustache, I look cool back then, okay? Not so cool anymore.

But at the end of the day, technology has moved ahead, how we operate, information flow, how fast we can get information, okay? Using AI, and it tells us exactly I knew what was happening on the railroad 5 minutes after I got up. I didn't have to phone anybody, okay? So I sent Eric, a little note to thanking him and the team on how well they're doing on recovering real fast. But at the end of the day, that's where we are. So the answer to get back to the first simplified non-AI-generated answer. The answer is no. I'm not worried.

Our next question is from the line of Richa Harnain with Deutsche Bank.

Megan Makini

This is Megan on for Richa. My question is for Jennifer. You laid out the full year expectation for compensation per employee to be up 4% to 5% year-over-year, and mentioned opportunities to offset the increasing wage and benefit inflation through a few things like process improvements and technology. Could you just clarify if that 4% to 5% increase includes your offsetting efforts? Or do those represent potential upside improving costs? And any color that you're willing to share on opportunities that you've already identified would be really helpful.

Jennifer Hamann
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. So yes, the 4% to 5% that we say is what I'll call that the net compensation per employees. So that already takes into consideration what we're planning to do. And when you think about the drivers of that inflation this year, it's really three things. It's the new agreements that we've signed and the wage inflation. It increases to health and welfare, so higher benefit cost as well as higher payroll taxes as they raise the limits every year in terms of what's taxable on a Tier 1 and Tier 2 basis. So those are the three main drivers.

In terms of what we're doing to offset that, it's really across the board. And Eric's team is certainly a big part of that, doing more with RCL, taking more car touches out so that you need fewer people working in the yards, doing more in terms of automating our switch operations.

Eric, do you want to go into a little bit more of that?

Eric Gehringer
Executive Vice President of Operations

Yes, you hit three of the really important ones. The other one that really stress is how we operate the railroad. When I look at other railroads, I see them take on initiatives where they've got some spend, say, $70 million on something, and they set a goal to reduce it by 2%. That's not how we do it here. Here at Union Pacific, we look at the fundamental. What is the thing that we have to do or the collection of things that ultimately result in the railroad running even better. And then we like to say the cost falls out. And so when you see our record number on car velocity, 9% above a record quarter last fourth quarter, when you see our locomotive productivity that's what I would encourage you to focus on. Watch as we continue.

And it's tough work. And when you put up as many gains as we put up, right, getting the next percent, it's tough. But as I tell my team all the time, we're in the business of doing hard. And my team's -- our team, excuse me, has delivered on that, and we'll continue to deliver that in '26.

Jennifer Hamann
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And that's where you see the continued gains on the workforce productivity, right?

Vincenzo Vena
CEO & Director

Exactly. So less people, even though the cost per employee might be up, right, the total cost for the company is in a different place just because of the productivity gains that we will continue to see. And you can see that from where our head count direction has been over the last few years.

Jennifer Hamann
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, up 2% volume in 2025 in total was down 3.5% on the workforce.

Vincenzo Vena
CEO & Director

Exactly. And let's not miss that because that's how you take care of the inflationary cost per employee as you need less employees to do the same amount of work, okay? Good question. Thank you very much.

The next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan.

Brian Ossenbeck
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I don't want to keep you too much longer from that double espresso. Probably...

Vincenzo Vena
CEO & Director

Brian, don't worry about me. I got nothing else to do today, okay? This is the most important thing I need to do today is make sure that people understand what we're doing. So I appreciate that you hanging on.

Brian Ossenbeck
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

All right. So just two kind of follow-up ones really. Eric, you just mentioned you're in the business of doing hard. It's hard to miss all the records you've been setting, but you're still expected to reset the bar and push higher. You gave a few comments about how you do that, but I just wanted to hear maybe a little bit more, especially I think you have 0 furloughs. So also maybe you can address sort of the resource buffer from the labor side. If we do get some positive upside or at least there'll be some uncertainty we're not thinking of right now.

And then Jim, just to wrap up maybe the M&A stuff. It doesn't sound like you're really thinking about addressing some other comments from the rails, just focused on the three main from the STB and also doesn't seem like you're too concerned about the whole red line and having to provide that publicly. So maybe if you can give some color on that to wrap up. Appreciate it.

Eric Gehringer
Executive Vice President of Operations

Yes, I'll start. So you brought up headcount, and I'll translate that into hiring. Now as we think about our hiring plan for 2026, remember a couple of things. First thing we look at is attrition, right? To maintain our buffer of resources, one of which is our crews. We've got to make sure that we cover attrition.

And then to the person's question, a few questions ago, we then do the puts and takes. So if we sign an agreement with the union, right, that may add heads, we don't expect that in 2026. But then we go through all of our technology initiatives, we go through the fundamentals that I was talking about, and we make adjustments to that.

Now a lot of people start on the labor side and they should. But we also are just as focused on the nonlabor side. So when you think about the work that we've done over the last 3 years on fuel, whether it's modernizing locomotives, the expansion of our energy management system, our program for where do we partial fill, full fill, that saved us tens of millions of dollars and that trend will continue. Even when we think about modernizations alone, that's a 5% fuel savings per unit that we modernize. So I'm telling you, we can go through the whole portfolio because that's how we manage it here. We come into the year with specific initiatives. There are dozens and dozens and dozens of them, and we work tirelessly to execute. And you saw the results in '25, and I expect that we'll be just as successful in '26.

Vincenzo Vena
CEO & Director

And Brian, if I can just add one thing on that is what you don't see is we are carrying extra people, but we don't have them furloughed. We actually have guarantee payments, just the way the collective agreements are that we -- and they're actually -- that buffer is built that way that we have some guaranteed payments. We try to structure the number of employees in the right place, and Eric and team do a fantastic job of driving that to be at the right place, so that we don't get behind. But we also are paying some guarantees that nobody would see outside of us internally. So that's where the excess that buffer is situated.

On the merger, listen, we always have different opinions. And it's interesting to hear the other railroads talk about some of the things they've talked about, like we're going to shut down 300 lanes. We don't have 300 lanes in intermodal to shut down. We have more than 300 customer-to-customer points, but trains going into terminals. So we're going to keep them all open. And in fact, we want to expand that, not be less we've put on new trains that run now from L.A. to the west side of Chicago, G2 because we see a market there that we didn't operate. So that's a lane we've added, and we want to continue to have the lanes that open up access for our customers east and west across the country.

And one railroad put out that I was -- they sent it out to the customers that I was a leader on the EJ&E in 2008. Well, I wasn't in the U.S. in 2008. I was battling the western part of the CN network. And -- but I still got credit for whatever happened on the EJ&E. So that's why I like to talk about fact not fiction. So bottom line is, as we move ahead, we're going to have to give some things, and we know that like this red line, I don't like it. I don't see what the benefit, but it's not about Jim Vena, it's about what the STB thinks. And they also need to be reasonable and understand that we're doing the right things because we're not holding anything back.

We've told them black and white day 1, when I called into the STB to tell them that we were going to merge, I said, "Tell us what you want, and we will provide it." There's no big secret. I think we're pretty open about fundamentally who we are, what we do, what we're trying to do move forward. And there isn't any big secret because it's such a compelling case.

So I don't like it because I don't think it adds to the merits, but guess what? I wish Jim Vena had a totalitarian system that I could get every decision that I want, but I don't even get it at home with my wife and kids for God's sakes, let alone with the regulator. And I'm good with that. That's just part of the process, and we knew that's what it was going to look like.

In fact, sometimes I don't even get it here in the company. Eric tries to tell me what to do. Jennifer, for sure, okay, tell me what they do. And Kenny, he's a little -- he's a really good salesman, okay? I always keep my hands on my wallet when he's around and make sure he doesn't take $10 out of my pocket. But at the end of the day, that's just the way life works, and we'll work through this because it's a compelling piece of business and compelling for our customers, the country, okay, and our employees. And I'm looking forward to when we have this railroad put together.

Our final question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.

Madison Pasterchick
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

It's actually Madison on for Ravi. I think I just have one kind of more of a cleanup question, not on M&A, so I'll give you a break on that. I know you had highlighted in the beginning of the call, the effect the winter storm had been having on some operations. I was just wondering if you were able to quantify at all what you think the impact on the quarter could be from the recent weather or if you just have any more color there?

Vincenzo Vena
CEO & Director

Jennifer?

Jennifer Hamann
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean it's going to add a little bit of cost to us, and that's really a cleanup cost, a little crew delay, extra limos, lodging, those types of things, probably a little extra propane for switch heaters because we lost commercial power in several places. But the big thing that we'll see sometimes in winter storms is lost revenue. If you've got long customer shutdowns, prolonged periods where we're not able to serve our customers. We don't see that happening as we sit here today, different than a couple of years ago when there were some bad weather in that Houston area, where you did have customers who were out for extended periods, that was much more impactful.

Again, as we sit here, we don't see that. So we'll look to make up the lost carloadings. You'll certainly see that reflected in next week's loads when we report out to AAR. But with a lot of the quarter in front of us, basically 2 months left, I think we'll make that up and really just be left with a little bit of extra cost from the cleanup.

Vincenzo Vena
CEO & Director

And it's a great question, and that's why it's really important for us to have the capability to recover fast. And the faster we can recover, and that's what I like about Thursday morning, number is looking pretty good, is that those impacts are not as significant, and we get back to the customers to say, ship us everything you got, we're ready to move and let's move ahead. So listen, thank you very much. Great question. That was the last question, Rob?

Operator

Yes, Mr. Vena, that was.

Vincenzo Vena
CEO & Director

Let me just tie it up here real quick, okay? Because I've really enjoyed the call this morning. I think it's great to talk about what we're doing and how we move ahead. And I appreciate the questions. I think the questions were great. Looking forward to talking to you after the first quarter results. But we're going to operate this railroad in the best way we can, with all the talent we have and people out in the field that do a spectacular job. And at the same time, we will work through the process for the merger. So I'm excited. The whole team is excited. We get up every morning.

We could have just left it alone and not worried about a merger and just ruled it out for a couple of years, ride the horse out in the range and have a little bit of fun, go out to the Super Bowl, go do whatever the heck we do when we're supposed to be working. But guess what? I'm not into that and neither is this team. We are here to deliver for our customers and win in the marketplace and be the best railroad in North America.

So we're challenged by our competitors. They're smart. They want to beat us. And at the end of the day, I love it. Let's go challenge, and we'll talk to you all later on. Thank you very much for taking the time, to spend a little bit of time with us this morning. Thank you.
