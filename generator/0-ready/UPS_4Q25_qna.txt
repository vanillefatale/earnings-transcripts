[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Vernon from Bernstein.

David Vernon
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

So I guess, Brian, maybe just a big picture question in terms of what's embedded in the guidance and sort of the exit rate as we're leaving 2026. I think you mentioned full year Domestic margins is expected to be flat. Can you kind of give us a sense for what the second half or the exit rate margin should be?

And then as far as kind of what's embedded in the Domestic cost outlook, is there any sort of numbers you can put around costs from the retirement of the MD-11s or additional stuff maybe that we didn't know before the earnings release today?

Brian Dykes
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President

Yes. Great. Thank you, Dave. So let me first just address the MD-11s. I think in the fourth quarter, included in our results was about $50 million of incremental lease costs that we incurred to replace the capacity. It will be about double that in 2026 that's included in the guidance, about 90% of that in the first half. The 767s are scheduled to come in through the course of the year with 5 in the first half and 10 in the second half, and then we'll have 3 in 2027. So that is the first part.

I think when we think about the shape of the year, there's a couple of really important things to think about. First, as we saw -- as we went through 2025, and Carol mentioned in her remarks, there's a timing lag between us taking the cost out and realizing the benefits in the P&L along with the volume. So as we go through the first quarter, we're going to have a step-down in the Amazon volume in the first quarter. We're taking actions in order to rightsize the variable costs, semi-variable costs and fixed costs, but there will be a lag in that, that will hit the second quarter.

So you do see pressure from 3 things in the first quarter. The drawdown of the Amazon volume and the timing of the cost out. The transition cost of moving Ground Saver back to the USPS that will go through the first half of the year, we'll see benefit come through in the second half of the year. And then as I mentioned before, this incremental MD-11 cost. That's going to put margin pressure on Domestic in the first half. The way to think about it is really about 100 basis points of pressure in the first half that relieves in the second half, most of that pressure coming in the first quarter, right?

In our International business, you have a similar dynamic, right, where we've got pressure from de minimis in the third quarter and fourth quarter that's going to roll into Q1. Additionally, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we had a lot of pull-forward in the first quarter of 2025. So we've got a really tough comp. So that's not only going to put pressure on the margin, as we saw in the fourth quarter, but also push down profit in International, where we expect profit to be down about 30% in the first quarter and then recover as we go throughout the year.

And then, look, I think in the second half, we will look at like a very different business, as I articulated. SMB and enterprise will be growing mid-single digits. We'll be in a much more efficient cost structure. We'll still be driving good mid-single-digit rev per piece improvement through our pricing. And our cost per piece will normalize as we rightsize the driver staffing, realize the benefits of automation, and we'll be exiting at a healthy double-digit margin that will take us into 2027.

Your next question is coming from Tom Wadewitz from UBS.

Thomas Wadewitz
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I wanted to see if you could give some thoughts on just kind of like the algorithm post the glide-down with Amazon. Do we think about it as -- for domestic package. So do we think about it as kind of low single digits revenue growth? Would that be kind of what you would aim for? And what kind of pace of margin improvement can you consider? I know, obviously, macro matters, so there are a lot of things you don't necessarily know, but maybe high level, how you think about that?

And then I guess within that, if we look into '26, '27, I think you've talked about maybe like $400 million to $500 million of EBIT headwind in '25 from the in-sourcing of SurePost. So now that you're handing that back to Postal, I don't know if you get that fully back and if that's kind of like half of a benefit in second half of this year and then half of it in '27. So just some -- I guess, some thoughts on kind of that overall domestic pack margin and how to look at it.

Brian Dykes
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President

Sure. Yes. Yes. Thanks, Tom. So as we think about the kind of go-forward algorithm, as I mentioned, look, we expect to see kind of mid-single-digit enterprise and SMB volume growth in the back half. Now our rev per piece will normalize because some of the mix benefits that we've seen, as the Amazon volume has come down, also come down. But we've had healthy base rate increases that have been continuing. So I would think about a couple of percent on the base rate.

From the cost side, our cost per piece will normalize as well, right? And we expect to see cost per piece come down below rev per piece. So we're driving unit cost improvement, as we have prior to the Amazon glide-down, and that will drive kind of structural long-term margin improvement as we go forward. So look, I think what we'll see in the back half of the year, as we're exiting with non-Amazon volume and revenue growth and margin improvement, will be the go-forward algorithm.

On the USPS cost, so the -- we will be transitioning a portion of our Ground Saver delivery back to the USPS through the first half of this year. We do expect that we'll see the benefits start to materialize in the second half. It will look slightly different than what we had before because, obviously, we're going back at a different rate than what we had before with the USPS, but that will translate into savings in the second half of this year and going forward. It also helps us with aligning our product strategy with how we want to think about an economy product as a holistic part of our product portfolio.

Thomas Wadewitz
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Do you think you get back to full $400 million to $500 million that you gave up in '25 or maybe not?

Brian Dykes
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President

As we rightsize the driver staffing levels and moving forward, then yes, over time, I think we'll get that back. It will take time, though, because we've got to migrate the work back and we have to rightsize the position levels commensurate with the new delivery stop levels.

Carol Tomé
CEO & Director

Yes, I wouldn't expect to see that full benefit until 2027.

Brian Dykes
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President

Correct.

Operator

Your next question is coming from Ken Hoexter from Bank of America.

Ken Hoexter
BofA Securities, Research Division

You threw out some costs pretty quickly there, Brian. I just want to clarify, did you throw out the costs in the first quarter on the driver out and the postal service costs' impact to that margin? But my question is just on the rate increases for both Domestic and International. I think you threw out there that it was going to be low single digit for Domestic. Your thought on how this should trend for core rate, both Domestic and International.

Brian Dykes
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President

Yes. So if you think about rev per piece for the year, Ken, it's about 4.5%, right, rev per piece growth. But you're going to be higher than that in the first half and then normalize to about 3% in the second half, right, as some of the mix benefit comes out. Look, in the fourth quarter, we saw a 340 basis point improvement in base rates. We've been seeing kind of around this 300 basis point improvement in base rates. I would expect that as you think about going forward.

Related to the driver out, we didn't give a number because we have not yet to launch the program. It's too early to make an estimate. Look, this is a tactical move that we used to do something similar last year in order to help us to rightsize the position levels and the network infrastructure with the new volume and delivery levels, right, because it includes the change in the Ground Saver stops as well. We'll keep you updated with that as we go through the course of this year.

Operator

Your next question is coming from Ari Rosa from Citigroup.

Ariel Rosa
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

So I wanted to dig a little bit further into the cost per piece trends. Obviously, it was elevated a bit in fourth quarter, but you talked, Brian, about that normalizing on a go-forward basis. Maybe you could separate those things out. Just like if we think about normalized CPP run rate, how we should think about that?

And then as we think about the improvement in revenue quality and the kind of shift in mix, does that assume kind of a higher cost per piece to handle that business? Or can we get that back to kind of that low single-digit run rate more in line with inflation?

Brian Dykes
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President

I think, yes. So Ari, I think, as you think about the cost per piece profile, again, it's going to trend down as we go through the year, right? It will look similar in the first quarter as it did to last year. But by the time we get through the year, and we transition Ground Saver, we've finalized the execution of the network reconfiguration and our cost-out, we're deploying additional automation that will go online through Network of the Future, yes, we will see the cost per piece normalize to that kind of normal inflation level, right? And with a 3% rev per piece growth rate and a lower cost per piece, right, we'll be able to get back to that kind of 100 basis point separation that we see to drive unit cost and margin improvement as we grow.

Carol Tomé
CEO & Director

And perhaps we could just comment on how are we driving this productivity. One way is through automation. We have 127 buildings that are automated. We are adding another 24 in 2026. The cost per piece in these automated buildings is 28% less than the cost per piece in our conventional buildings. So automation is one way that we will continue to drive productivity. And then we're just getting better from a capacity perspective and a production perspective.

And, Nando, maybe you want to comment on that.

Nando Cesarone
Executive VP & President of U.S. and UPS Airline

Yes, sure. So I think first 6 months next year will be -- or this year, I'm sorry, will be very similar to last year. In fact, we've already started optimizing some of the closures of sorts and buildings because we didn't stop automating until December 31. We did take a day off, but we're right at it -- right back at it. And just for some proof points, as we worked through the month of December, the activity was up 4.4%. And by activity, I mean a lot more stops out there to serve our customers when, in fact, the volume was soft and negative. That is going to flip on us.

So I'm very confident that the cost per piece will be in a much better position as we align to the driver buyout proposals that we're discussing, Network of the Future implementations, our building closures, sort closures and, of course, the outsourcing of the USPS line.

Your next question is coming from Chris Wetherbee from Wells Fargo.

Christian Wetherbee
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Maybe if we could touch a little bit on the International segment, make sure we just sort of move through the -- run through the moving pieces there. Obviously, we talked a lot about the domestic side, but just get a sense of some of the pressure there. Maybe we can sort of break out some of the individual costs or de minimis pressures as we go through first quarter specifically, but also first half.

Brian Dykes
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President

Yes. Thanks, Chris. So yes, in the International segment, what you saw in the third quarter is we did see export volume decline for the first quarter in 2025. That was really -- there was a lot of pressure both from Canada and Mexico as well as continued decline in our China to U.S. lanes and really all of our U.S. inbound lanes. That's going to roll over into the first quarter as well.

Look, I think what we expect to see evolve in the International business is we are going to see extreme weakness in the first quarter that kind of gradually recovers. There's 2 dynamics going on. One is -- the first is volume, right? So volume, we will lap the tariff impact in May and start to see positive growth from that. And then we'll lap the de minimis impact in September.

The second dynamic is the trade lanes are shifting, right? And that's driving a margin headwind. Look, we make double-digit margin on our -- all of our U.S. inbound lanes. But the ones that are growing, right, are, call it, mid-teens versus the high double-digit margins that we've got in 20%, 30% margins that we have in the China to U.S. lanes.

So while we're seeing some offsetting volume growth, we are seeing margin pressure as a result of that. That also will abate as we go through the year. And we expect to see not only volume normalize, but also margin improve as we go through the year. And look, and I think the revenue quality actions that we're taking in International helped to offset the volume declines in the third quarter and will continue to help drive revenue growth as we go through Q2, Q3 and Q4 of next year.

Christian Wetherbee
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. But the EBIT decline, that's year-over-year or sequential that you noted for?

Brian Dykes
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President

Year-over-year.

Carol Tomé
CEO & Director

The way I would do it just simply is we were down 360 basis points in the fourth quarter. It's going to be like that in the first because nothing is changing until we actually anniversary Liberation Day and then the move of the de minimis exception. So just got some tough comparisons, but we'll manage through it. And Kate is doing a really nice job of managing the network so that we can serve our customers because there is growth in parts of the world.

Maybe you want to talk, Kate, about where you're seeing growth?

Kathleen Gutmann
Executive VP and President of International, Healthcare & Supply Chain Solutions

Yes, absolutely. We mentioned before years ago when we first saw the China lockdown, we invested heavily in Asia diversification, and it has really unlocked growth. We are in Vietnam in a new air hub, and it's already 80% full for our 5-year plan. So we've actually got double-digit growth going out of a lot of the Asian countries, but they're going to Europe and India. And so we shifted with the trade. So while we do that, you have to pull down the block hours, and we have shown that over the last couple of years that, that is what we do.

So we are seeing good growth, and we're helping our customers to understand the shift as well, whether it be by lane or by mode, package to forwarding or the reverse. So proud of the team. Last year, with the tariff and de minimis, haven't seen anything like it in 36 years and proud to say that we've delivered, for instance, in the fourth quarter, the 18% margin.

Your next question is coming from Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs.

Jordan Alliger
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Question for you. Can you maybe talk a little bit more what underpins, I think you said mid-single-digit type of package growth in the second half. Is it inventories in better shape so that we could see business-to-business grow again? Is there some expectation that the tax benefits or refunds, which are higher this year, will help the consumer and demand? And assuming that type of volume happens, I mean talk about your confidence level in the revised network and headcount moving the goods.

Carol Tomé
CEO & Director

Well, just from a macro perspective, the U.S. small package market appears to be stabilizing. The market, excluding Amazon, is projected to grow in the low single digits. So we should grow along with that. And fiscal and monetary policy changes should support this growth. Further, the outlook for manufacturing is better, if not robust, but it's better, which gives us confidence that we can grow into that space as well.

And the one thing I would ask you to remember, candidly, growth is a reflection of year-over-year comparisons, and we are going to anniversary the decisions that we made to exit not just some of the Amazon volume, but also Chinese e-commerce volume. So you just naturally get some growth from a year-over-year comparison.

Brian, what would you like to add to that?

Brian Dykes
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President

I think also, Jordan, the places where we have been investing, we are seeing wins, right? Health care, even in the Domestic small package business, SMB health care is a robust growth area for us. automotive, the air products. So we're seeing the quality volume that we've been shifting to show up in the network, right? In the fourth quarter, we saw heavier weights. We saw longer zones. We saw the highest SMB penetration we've ever had, the highest B2B penetration we've had in 4 years.

So the mix shift is happening, and we can see that. That enables us to lean in, in the places where we've invested, we've got differentiated capabilities that we want to grow. And that helps support, as Carol said, growth in excess of the market.

Carol Tomé
CEO & Director

And on the differentiating capabilities, perhaps I'll just take a moment to talk about our RFID capability. As you know, we've been talking to you about RFID or our Smart Package Smart Facility initiative for a few years, and it's really starting to crystallize into 3 big pillars. The first is what we call smart facility, but it's really a smart car, where we've enabled now all of our cars with RFID sensors. So we're moving from a scanning to a sensing network. And what this does? Well, it makes us more productive on the car but also improves the level of misloads.

Then by using the RFID labeling, our packages become smarter, which reduces defects. But the more interesting development, which drives commercial business, is what we call smart fulfillment. And what smart fulfillment is, is putting the RFID labeling at the point of origin, which gives better transparency order-to-cash, something that customers are desperately seeking. It gives them better control. And so we launched the RFID fulfillment, if you will, in the fourth quarter by putting RFID labeling at the origin of all of our UPS stores. We have 5,500 UPS stores, as you know. They're processing now 1.3 million packages a day with RFID labeling. And this is allowing us to earn new commercial business.

So it's not just the fact that the market is growing and we've got some easier compares. It's we're investing in capabilities that are turning into wins. In fact, the win for Domestic business in the fourth quarter, and we saw during peak, the win during the fourth quarter was 25% higher than a year ago.

Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley.

Ravi Shanker
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Carol, you gave us long-term targets for 2026 at your Investor Day in 2024. And obviously, a lot has happened since then. I'm sure you'll have an Investor Day early next year. But in the meanwhile, how do you think we should think about that long-term earnings growth trajectory and where kind of normalized EPS is at this time kind of in your view?

Carol Tomé
CEO & Director

Well, I think it's such a fair question to ask us. But clearly, things have changed a lot since 2024 because back then we hadn't planned the Amazon glide-down. So what I'd ask, Ravi, is that you let us get through this year. 2026 is the pivotal year for UPS. And once we get through this year, we'll come back out and give our view on long-range targets.

Operator

Our next question comes from Bruce Chan from Stifel.

J. Bruce Chan
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I don't know if you've discussed it in the past, but I'm just curious if maybe you can talk about the selection process for which facilities were automated in '25 versus what's ahead in '26. And I guess what I'm trying to get to is whether there's anything to read from the complexity of the operations that you attacked last year versus what you've got ahead this year.

Carol Tomé
CEO & Director

So Nando, talk about our process.

Nando Cesarone
Executive VP & President of U.S. and UPS Airline

Yes. So look, we've got -- and we have reviewed this, I think, a couple of calls ago, where we look at each individual site, 1,100 checkpoints of things that we need to make sure that we are absolutely sure because once we close, we're not going back to those facilities. And then we take a very, very detailed exercise to make sure we're pointing that volume to the automation. And so what's happening is you're seeing a cascading effect of sites being closed that are legacy conventional facilities, a lot of labor required to run those facilities to a much more nimble, quicker, automated, consolidated facility.

And as we bring in all of those peripheral centers, we start to see the efficiencies of feeds, cube utilization. And of course, any service disconnects are -- can be rationalized right there in one facility. So that's also helping from a customer perspective.

The next set of buildings, of course, we wanted to accelerate and we went after the more complex, bigger facilities in the middle of our project last year. They will be just as challenging, but we don't see any concerns whatsoever in the complexity and closing these centers and making sure they map back to the automation so we can help ourselves financially.

Carol Tomé
CEO & Director

And while staying on service, and that's really still important, is to not trade off productivity or cost-out for service. And I'm proud that we have 8 years in a row now of leading service. One other observation about how the team is performing in this regard because I'm super proud of them. The beginning of last year, we targeted 73 buildings to be closed as related to our Amazon glide-down. We actually closed 93. This year, you've targeted 24 buildings. My guess is there'll be a few more closures than the 24 you've identified.

Nando Cesarone
Executive VP & President of U.S. and UPS Airline

Yes. So that's just the first half. We continually put all of those facilities through a process to make sure that we're not missing anything. We suspect in the range of 24 for sure, first half, that we've got another 60 or 70 worth assessing, and then we'll have a number that comes [ out of that ].

Carol Tomé
CEO & Director

And we'll update you as we go.

Your next question is coming from Richa Harnain from Deutsche Bank.

Richa Talwar
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

So just piggybacking off of that question, great stat on the cost per piece being 28% lower in these automated facilities than your conventional ones, Carol. But you talked about the runway now you have for that to continue. But how does that play into maybe your ability to do more with less? So how can we think about your CapEx plans? Your 2026 CapEx outlook is below 2025, that's despite replacement plans for fleet, which you spoke to. So maybe talk a little bit more about what's underpinning that? And as you adjust to maybe a smaller footprint, a more efficient footprint, how should we think about the long-term CapEx outlook?

Carol Tomé
CEO & Director

Sure. I'll start, and then, Brian, you can jump in. When you think about our network, Nando mentioned 1,100 points in the U.S., some of those buildings are really old. A lot of maintenance expense. And as we're closing those buildings, that maintenance expense goes away. So that's part of the year-over-year change. On the fleet additions, we're actually financing the aircraft through a burn-in lease structure. That, Brian, you might want to describe.

Brian Dykes
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President

Yes, sure. Yes. And Richa, yes, as Carol mentioned, yes, we do have financing structures around the aircraft. And -- but I think importantly, look, if you think about the CapEx profile, look, our volumes continue to come down, right? And as Carol mentioned, we've closed facilities. When we look at the asset categories where we really have pulled back, we're not buying as many vehicles, right, because we don't need them as we rightsize the U.S. network. We continue to invest in our international network through both air hubs, aircraft and vehicles. But it's bringing down our maintenance expense, it's bringing down our vehicle expense.

And look, I think as we turn and we continue to grow, we'll be kind of around this 3% to 3.5% of revenue is a normalized CapEx. But we're creating more efficiency. We're creating more flexibility, so you don't have to spend CapEx on variable capacity like we used to. And that's going to allow us to run a more capital-efficient network going forward.

Operator

Your next question is coming from Jason Seidl from TD Cowen.

Jason Seidl
TD Cowen, Research Division

Carol, I think you talked a little bit about the technology that's going to redirect parcels to the USPS versus sort of in-house. Can you maybe give us some more color on that in terms of how much of your network is going to be equipped with that by the end of the year and sort of how we should think about that helping margins over the longer term because I'm assuming that will help with cost as well as productivity?

Carol Tomé
CEO & Director

Well, I'm happy to talk about the math a bit. But on the technology part of it, I'll throw it back over to Nando.

Nando Cesarone
Executive VP & President of U.S. and UPS Airline

Yes. So just on the Saver portion, we will have that network up and running by end of this month. And so it's really a matter of some of the conversions we did last year with our customers, making sure that the labels are readable by both UPS and the USPS as we tender through the automation to the SPS for last mile delivery.

The magic algorithms are within our control. So we can expand those. In fact, the peak season, I think we expanded those proximity stops up to 500 feet in some cases, down to 100 feet or an exact match to the address. It really depends on the mix of volume that's in our network. But as far as delivering the service physically, we can move the packages. We need to enable the packages so they can be read through the network and then through the USPS to our end customer.

Carol Tomé
CEO & Director

And, Matt, you're responsible for this relationship. So is there any color you want to add in terms of volume going to the postal service?

Matthew Guffey
Executive VP & Chief Commercial & Strategy Officer

No, I think -- just a couple of points. One is, look, we continue -- to Nando's point, we continue to ramp the volume up in the month of January. And it also gives us an opportunity that Brian highlighted earlier, is really to differentiate our product portfolio because our customers are asking us, one, they want the reliability of the UPS network, but we -- and the service that we can provide, we've demonstrated we can provide, but they also want to make sure they have an economical option.

So this really gives us an opportunity, to both Nando and Carol's point, to, one, bring our customers online and get these dual labels so that we can have -- they can have visibility, but also giving them the right experience along the way with that economic option.

Carol Tomé
CEO & Director

And it's not just the economics. We're going into the DDUs. And that opportunity was not presented to us a year ago. So we're very excited to be able to use the DDUs because that will ensure our service [ labels ] stay high.

Your next question is coming from Bascome Majors from Susquehanna.

Bascome Majors
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

If we go back to the 2023 deal with the Teamsters, you had to absorb a lot of inflation really quick, and then you had 3 years of fairly moderate labor inflation in the U.S. and then that was scheduled to tick up in the fifth year of the contract.

Can you talk a little bit about what the initial plan was to deal with that cadence of high labor inflation, low, and then some moderate increase in the back half? How the Amazon glide-down and the network reconfiguration has maybe changed that plan? And ultimately, how you feel about dealing with that uptick in labor inflation in the U.S. in the second half of next year?

Carol Tomé
CEO & Director

Well, at that time, we also were looking at Network of the Future, as you can recall, which was the rationalization of our network, the automation with inside of our network, and that work has progressed quite nicely. We are ahead of where we thought we would be. You couple that with the Amazon glide-down and the number of employees in our workforce was down considerably. As Brian pointed out, we're down over 40,000 people. That's going to impact the cost of any contract -- contractual increase on wage, of course. So we're managing through this, I think, very well.

And Brian, is there anything you want to add?

Brian Dykes
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President

Sure. And I think Carol hit on the right points, right? When we started out with the labor contract, we knew that we were going to be investing in order to create a lower labor-intensive network, right, with more flexibility that had the ability to scale, right, particularly for peak because we're seeing peak being increasingly important without the need for so much labor. You're seeing that, right? We saw it with and without the Amazon [ drawdown ] in -- without in 2024, with and without in 2025. We've set out targets for incremental position eliminations that will drive efficiency in 2026.

And so as we approach that point, we will be driving down total expense. At the same time, remember, we will have a different characteristic of revenue in the network so that the incremental costs will not turn customer ORs upside down, right? And so we'll have a less labor-intensive, more nimble, more profitable network that will minimize the impact of the increase.

And, Matthew, we have time for one more question.

Operator

Our final question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.

Brandon Oglenski
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I guess can we maybe summarize all this? Because it sounds like you guys are really protecting service even though the network is getting smaller here. Does that create any market share opportunities or challenges, especially with where pricing is going up for the industry as well? I appreciate it.

Carol Tomé
CEO & Director

Service is paramount to winning new business. It's almost table stakes. Without it, how do you win? It's not just service, though. It's capabilities, and the capabilities that we've been investing in, I talked a little bit about RFID, but there are a lot of other capabilities that we've been investing in that's allowing us to take share.

I'll focus us right on our Digital Access Platform. When I joined the company, the revenue in that platform was $139 million. Fast forward to the end of 2025, $4.1 billion. We continue to add more partners to the platform. We're growing it globally, not just in the United States. And that platform is something that small- and medium-sized businesses enjoy using for delivery as they're selling through partners like eBay and Shopify and others. So we're going to continue to invest in capabilities that allow us to win new business. The service is paramount.

Thank you. I will now turn the floor back over to your host, Mr. PJ Guido.

Thank you, Matthew, and this concludes our call. Thank you for joining, and have a good day.
