Your first question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan.

Douglas Anmuth
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Dara, can you just talk about the path to increase the 20% of MAPC season markets where you have Mobility and Delivery, they use Uber One and you talk about these drivers of cross-platform usage. And then could you expand on the recently announced NVIDIA partnership. Both of you have invested in several AV tech providers. You've also talked about deploying 100,000 vehicles. Can you talk about the time line and then who will own the fleet in that scenario?

Dara Khosrowshahi
CEO & Director

Sure, absolutely. So in terms of cross-platform and the penetration there, as we talked about, about 20% of consumers where we operate both Mobility and Delivery because we know and operate Mobility and Delivery in every single country that we operate in. Only 20% of consumers are active across both businesses. And for example, 30% of our Mobility riders have never tried any Uber Eats offering and 75% have never tried gross in retail. And typically, where we see a higher penetration of that is in markets where Mobility and Delivery are particularly strong in terms of their penetration, Australia would be an example of that. And so just mathematically, the cross-platform crossover is higher.

What we have now done, what we're doing now is to set of specific programs to drive cross-platform behavior. So you'll see kind of top tabs in Rides and Uber Eats app to make it easier to transact across the various businesses. We're creating like personalized experiences to upsell based on context, let's say, Ride to Eats. If you're going to work, we'll offer you Starbucks on the way to work. That's a great incremental business for Starbucks and it's kind of a delightful experience for you as well. And then, of course, membership is a huge factor in deepening kind of our own relationship with consumers, but then also introducing cross platform as well.

So all of those are various ways to drive cross-platform the average cross-platform consumer is spending 3x more than kind of monoline consumers. So it's just a mathematical and unique advantage that we have. And I think we're very, very early in terms of the innings in terms of driving cross-platform activity. It's happening naturally. And again, a lot of innovation going on from the teams to make sure that when we target cross-platform usage, we're doing with kind of with the right context and not getting in the way of your just ordering pizza on a Friday night.

In terms of NVIDIA, we are very, very excited about the partnership there. NVIDIA is creating with Hyperion like a reference architecture for L4-ready autonomous that they are going to make available to any OEM out there. And if you kind of step back and you think about the strategy, a future 10 years from now, where every single new car sold, is not only L3-ready if it's a personal car, but it's also L4-ready if you want to contribute that car to a ride-sharing platform like ours or fleets might buy those cars as well. That is a very bright future for the world because it will make the world safer in terms of these autonomous vehicles being super safe, not getting distracted in terms of driving, but it's also very good for our ecosystem and that we will have already kind of supply of cars on our platform as well. And we are very early, but I think that we're quite confident in demonstrating that cars, L4 cars that are on our platform can drive higher revenue per car per day than cars than aren't on our platform.

So we think that the NVIDIA strategy and our strategy is very much aligned. We announced the relationship also with Stellantis with a initial 5,000 vehicles that are going to be powered by NVIDIA as well. But we expect that to scale significantly more going forward. We will use our -- again, NVIDIA is building the software as well. So it's a hardware platform, but NVIDIA is also investing in building out L4 software stack that will be than essentially distributable on any car using the Hyperion 10 platform, which is a great reference architecture.

And then in terms of who's going to own the fleet, we will -- we can lean in with our balance sheet early on to kind of establish the economics of these fleets. But eventually, we think that you're going to have -- just like you've got these REITs owning hotels, better yield vehicles, I think that you will see yield vehicles show up for fleets in terms of whether they're owned by private equity or public fleets out there. So we can lean in with our balance sheet, but we think that all these assets are going to be financialized over a period of time.

So very excited about the partnership. Obviously, if there's one ally you want in the world in terms of AI or autonomous is NVIDIA and super excited to innovate with them.

The next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.

Eric Sheridan
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

On the Delivery side of the business, as you continue to widen out the array of what you're offering users, can you talk a little bit about how much of that is a stimulant to new user growth for Uber Eats or a driver of increased frequency across the broader platform, just to better understand where the sort of the output of the yield is showing up in the business. And then on the AV side, maybe the building on Doug's question, where you've rolled out AVs today, what have you learned so far with respect to the impact of more supply on the road and how it helps either stimulate demand or impact on the pricing side?

Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Eric, it's Prashanth. I'll take the first part of that on Delivery and then let Dara address the AV side. We had a -- we're really thrilled with how the Delivery business has accelerated. For the third quarter, it's the fastest growth we've seen in 4 years, four points of acceleration. And it's really -- you're seeing that growth pretty broad across multiple markets. and it's coming from investments that we're making in a number of areas on improving the product.

On the grocery and retail side specifically, we're very excited on how grocery and retail is leading to an introduction of folks into the Online Food Delivery as well. And we're seeing great growth, and I think we have some data in our supplemental charts that show some of the statistics around that, which is gross and retail being a source of creating consumers for the Online Delivery, Grocery and Retail. It's a great TAM for us. I think in the prepared remarks, we may have mentioned that we're at now a $12 billion run rate, which is it's growing at a meaningfully faster rate than our Online Food Delivery. And we'll continue to lean into that Grocery Retail Business, which is now variable contribution positive. So it's helping us carry its own weight with high growth and really working quite complementary with Delivery.

And then as Dara just answered in Doug's question, it's a cross-platform strategy that we're working on to help folks move across all three of our LOBs.

Dara Khosrowshahi
CEO & Director

And then, Eric, in terms of how AVs are affecting the overall business, listen, it's very, very early, the biggest scale operations that we've got are with Waymo in Austin and Atlanta. And what we are seeing is that those markets are growing faster than other U.S. markets. And this is in a Q3 where the U.S. actually accelerated nicely Q3 over Q2. So the overall U.S. market is strong, but we're finding that, for example, growth in Phoenix often Atlanta was more than twice the rest of the U.S. So that's certainly a good signal. What that has also led to is that driver earnings in those markets are super, super healthy as well.

So in Austin, for example, where we have the most AVs on the ground, drive our earnings per hour actually outpaced the rest of the U.S. So whether or not the growth in those markets is correlation or causal, it's too soon to tell. But the market certainly look healthy. Our partnership with Waymo continues to be excellent from an operational standpoint. Waymo utilization is still very, very high. And what we're seeing is an overall market that's healthy as well, which is a really good signal as we transition to this hybrid network of AVs and human drivers.

The next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

Brian Nowak
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I have two, one on Mobility and one on Delivery. The first one on Mobility, the U.S. business seems to be doing very well again. Just curious for any further color on progress you're making in the urban versus suburban strategy or the sparse city strategy that you talked about call it, 6 or 9 months ago, sort of drivers of that growth and the nice trip growth you're seeing in the U.S., urban versus suburban.

Now in Food Delivery, any color you can give us about the European Food Delivery Business. One of your competitors is going to be entering a couple of those markets potentially a little more aggressively to come. How do you sort of think about the key investment areas into '26 you're focused on in the European Food Delivery Business?

Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah
Chief Financial Officer

Okay. Thanks, Brian. I'm going to handle the first question on Mobility and then Dara will talk about competitors in the Food Delivery space.

So the sparse geography strategy, which we had talked about. This originally, if you recall, this originally was an output of the work that we had led on focusing on how to increase our Delivery Business. And in that analysis and as we begin to look at how we can make better progress on Delivery, we identified that there was more opportunities for us to continue to push on sparse geographies in the Mobility area.

And the benefit that we're seeing there really is first, it's a very large footprint. So as we look across the globe here and similar for the U.S. our sparse geographies are actually growing at about 1.5x the rate of our denture market, and the penetration opportunity in these sparse markets continues to be quite high. We -- our rough take is that we're maybe 20% into what the opportunity is on the sparse market. So still lots of upside there. And again, that's global numbers, but you're sort of seeing similar demographics for the U.S., which I think is where your question was.

So in focusing on the sparse geographies, we're really focused on three areas. It is on the expanding the availability of the product, increasing the reliability of the product and then ensuring that we have the right product fit. So for example, the wait and save product has been an excellent match for the sparse geographies because typically, when you're in a more suburban environment -- you're in a situation where you don't mind waiting a little bit for your ride, which gives us the ability to find the right match and to compensate for the lower density of cars, which may be in that market. So all of that is continuing to feed the flywheel, and we feel very excited about how smart geographies are going to continue to provide growth for our U.S. market for many quarters to come. I'll hand here now to Dara to talk about the Delivery Competition environment.

Dara Khosrowshahi
CEO & Director

Yes, absolutely. So we are very happy about our position in Europe. We've got the leading position in Europe. We have become the #1 player in the U.K. We've been the #1 player in France for some period of time. We're gaining category position very solidly in both Spain and Germany. I was visiting there last week to visit with the teams and understand a bit more with -- about the market. So the momentum in Europe and the profitability in Europe is excellent.

And listen, food is a huge category. It's no surprise. This is $2 trillion TAM and food and kind of $10 trillion in grocery. So competition is going to be a fact. We have built a position in Europe organically and some of our competitors have had to buy their way into a European position, and that's always more difficult because it comes with a bunch of integration, mess, et cetera, that we don't have to deal with.

And I think from our standpoint, we're going to do more of the same, which is it's all about expanding merchant selection and improving service, improving reliability in terms of delivering the food to you exactly as expected at the right time. we're going to use the power of the platform to drive cross-sell and membership as well. And then we're going to continue to kind of deepen our partnership with the ecosystem. You've seen announcements with OpenTable, Instacart, iFood as well in Brazil, not in Europe, obviously, but in Brazil.

And I think the last thing that I would say is, we competed with a number of these players outside of the U.S. We compete with DoorDash in many markets, in Australia, Japan, Canada and we've been gaining category position in those markets for some period of time. So competition against these players is nothing new. And certainly, in the U.S., in Europe and the rest of the world, we have been a category gainer for some period of time. while improving profitability, and I expect that to continue.

The next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America.

Justin Post
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just would love to hear you talk about the margin flow-through in the quarter if you made any extra investments? And then second, you're thinking about the investments you're going to need over the next 12, 18 months to really scale your AV business? And could that impact Mobility margins?

Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah
Chief Financial Officer

Okay. Yes. Justin, I'll take the first one, and I'll let Dara sort of comment on that second one there.

So maybe let's take a step back to reflect on third quarter. Our profit, our EBITDA was up 33% and year-over-year. And as a result, we hit an all-time high for our margins at 4.5% of GB, which is up roughly 40 bps year-over-year. The outlook for Q4 is pretty consistent. Another rinse and repeat and we are tracking exactly where we want to be against the 3-year framework we gave you in February of '24, and that is mid- to high teens gross bookings growth and a high 30% to 40% EBITDA CAGR.

We really are proud of how we've been able to drive profitable growth at scale here, both Mobility and Delivery are accelerating, and that's accelerating off of a pretty enormous base. So it is tough to really defy the law of large numbers. And with that growth, we're converting that into the strong profitability and generating a ton of cash, almost $9 billion on a trailing 12 month, which were which we're using to reduce share count.

So we are very deliberately as we have said for several quarters now, we are very deliberately moderating the pace of our margin expansion. Over the last couple of years, we demonstrated that this enterprise and this business model can be profitable.

We've taken our -- for example, we've taken our Delivery Business from when I joined in late '23 from like a low 2% EBITDA margin to now almost 4%. And that has been through to demonstrate that this is a great business. These are both great businesses. With that, we're now asking investors measure us on total profitability understand that we are committed to annual profit expansion year-over-year profit expansion for as far into the future as we can see. But we will sort of run the balance between the two product lines and on a sequential basis to make investments. And that's because we -- as we've said many times, we have so many exciting opportunities to invest in I won't go through a big laundry list here, but Dara has already mentioned the exciting things we see on cross platform. The investments we're making in affordability and low-cost product offerings is partly what is responsible for the acceleration in Mobility that we're talking about.

In some earlier questions, we talked about grocery and retail, which are being a great source of adding new consumers. So I could go on and on, but that's the model, and we're excited about the future. And I would just continue to remind investors focus on our overall profit dollar expansion and know that we are committed to grow that on an annual basis for as far into the future as we can see.

Let me now relate that among the many exciting investment opportunities to hand off to Dara to talk about investment opportunities in AV.

Dara Khosrowshahi
CEO & Director

Yes, Justin, so just putting some perspective in terms of AV, is not profitable today. And any new product that we introduced into the marketplace starts off in a position where we're losing money, and we're unprofitable. And the pattern is the same every single time, introduce a new product, invest in building up supply of that product. Once we invest in building out that supply of that product, we build up liquidity in the ecosystem. And as we build up liquidity, we build more consumer demand as liquidity and reliability improves, consumer demand improves as does willingness to pay to improve.

Like that, we've done it 10x, 15x over and over again. And if you look at our strategy on the Mobility business, it's a bit of a barbell strategy. So we've got kind of UberX, which is kind of the baseline business. And then we have some premium products like U4B, Uber for business that has premium margins like black and reserve that also come with premium margins as well. And we use those premium margins to invest into some of the categories that we're trying to build our growth back, for example. So this was taxi. It was 2-wheelers, Moto, 3-wheelers, autorickshaws in India is UberX share, for example. All of those products have been unprofitable when we launch. And as we build out liquidity kind of the profitability of those products improves, and frankly, we can turn those products profitable if we wanted tomorrow, but it's about the balance of investing in profitability and growth.

The same is true of AV here, which is as we're building out our supply base, we'll lose money in AV. I expect that AV won't be profitable for a few years going forward. And as we build liquidity, we can take margins up. Right now, it looks exactly like a number of our early products and kind of we can balance the overall margins of our Mobility business with this barbell strategy of premium products, feeding some of our investment products and feeding some of the new growth bets.

As it relates to AV, we'll also use our balance sheet. We'll kind of invest in the AV ecosystem, various players. We will -- we have established a global kind of fleet network to make sure that they can clean the cars, recharge the cars, et cetera. And we're also investing in AV data collection and partnership with NVIDIA, so that we are collecting kind of ride share specific data that we can provide to our partners as well. So this is -- it's something we've done multiple times, and we expect to run the play again in AV in terms of the barbell strategy that we've got.

The next question comes from Ron Josey with Citi.

Ronald Josey
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Maybe sticking with the investment theme, but a to your point on lifetime investments. I think in the letter, you talked about suggested some short-term investments for loyalty gains. Can you help us understand a little bit more on these loyalty gains on the Uber One benefits? Clearly, you've talked about cross-platform. And then back on U.S. trip growth which accelerated affordability, the barbell approach totally get it. Talk to us about insurance rates and then the benefits from newer driver or newer riders like seniors and teens.

Dara Khosrowshahi
CEO & Director

Yes, absolutely. So we're very, very happy about our progress in Uber One. I think the last time that we talked to, we talked about 36 million members growing at healthy rates. That continues. So the penetration of Uber One's in terms of gross bookings, it's about 2/3 of gross bookings for our Delivery Business and continues to increase its gross bookings penetration in Mobility as well. And the benefits are there -- frankly, they're just the best benefits in the industry. You got 6% cash back on rides, no delivery fee up to 10% off of orders plus exclusive selection an upgrade to priority delivery and then kind of surprise and delight other moments as well that we give to our members.

The other good news for us is that when we look at membership cohorts, and membership retention, even though members the number of members is growing very, very fast, the cohorts actually in terms of retention continued to improve. Especially as we move a higher percentage of the users from monthly passes to annual passes as well. And then at the same time, we continue to roll out the program geographically. We're up in -- we're now in 42 countries versus 28 a year ago.

Now I would tell you that early on in the initial months when someone becomes a member, typically, that is profit negative for us because the discounts that we offer the member exceed the increment in terms of how much they use the product and/or how well we retain them. Both of those go up. As the members mature, 6-plus months, then the members actually become profitable as well. So in the first 6 months, actually moving someone over to membership, especially moving someone who is already a high-frequency user, is a net negative. We still make money on those members, but it's a net negative in terms of margins. And then it becomes a net positive as the power of the platform comes in, cross platform comes in and the retention kicks in as well.

So it's just an example of kind of a near-term investments that we make to drive long-term engagement and long-term growth and the math behind those investments in terms of the lifetime value versus the cost of a member acquisition continues to improve.

As a result, we're also kind of investing in more partnerships to align our membership program with other membership programs. Obviously, we have a best-in-breed program with Amex, the consumer Platinum spend. But you're also seeing like exclusive premium table reservations via OpenTable, discounted or sometimes free Clear Plus memberships as well. So the power of the membership is actually getting stronger as we align with others in the industry as well.

Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah
Chief Financial Officer

Ron, I'll take the second part of that question on insurance. And 2025 really has been a very good year for us in terms of the progress that we've made. And maybe before I get into the elements, just a shout out to the cross-functional team across Uber U.S., who really has helped us in a number of different areas, make great progress in '25.

So we've always talked about sort of three elements to our insurance strategy. And over the course of this year, all three have really contributed to what I think will be beneficial for us in '26 and as we go forward.

On the legislation side, we've had a number of great wins in a variety of different areas, Georgia, Nevada and then most recently, I think there's been a bit of press on the wins in California, which will help specifically reduce the uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage limits that are applicable to us from $1 million down to $60,000 on an individual basis and $300,000 per accident. That is very beneficial for us in California, and it adds to the momentum that we've seen in a number of other states.

On the tech side, we've talked about the driving insights dashboard, and this is a product that the tech team has developed that allows our drivers to get some intelligence and some performance feedback on what their driving behavior is doing. It helps alert them to jack rabbit starts and hard braking, sharp turns and so forth. And by giving them this feedback, we are actually seeing drivers on their own sort of improve their driving behavior. And it's actually -- we've seen -- after we've introduced that visibility to drivers, we've seen more miles driven by those in the highest scoring bucket, which is an indicator that folks are adjusting their behavior to be safer drivers.

And then the sort of the cherry on top of that is we've now introduced advantage mode into select cities, and we'll continue to roll that out and advantage mode actually provide some rewards to those drivers who are the -- who are improving their driving score.

And then lastly, on the commercial side, by having a captive and having a top class team that is working on the commercial negotiations we have the ability to continue to keep our partnerships really at a stable level and also where need be, apply some tension on who holds the risk and who holds how much profitability our partners can share from that, and that allows us to keep tension on the cost side. So the result of all these efforts is that we expect that we're going to see hundreds of millions of dollars of savings. And we look to pass those savings on to customers through lower fares really across the U.S. for next year.

The next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays.

Ross Sandler
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Just wanted to ask about the new multiple gig initiatives. So what are some of the areas that you're looking into for new work, new earnings potential? And stepping back, how it this initiative impact things like driver retention or overall profitability for Uber compared to just kind of operating only the two areas of earnings that we're in today?

Dara Khosrowshahi
CEO & Director

Yes, absolutely. So just similar to the consumer where we see consumers using multiple platforms they retain better. They use our -- they get embedded with their platform more. The same is true for earners, which is to the extent that they use is for delivering and shopping, et cetera, or delivering and/or Mobility. They're embedded with the platform or retain them for longer, et cetera.

What kind of -- one way of looking at Uber, obviously, we are a logistics transformation platform in terms of moving people places or getting anything to your home or getting a truck to ship your goods.

Another way of looking at our platform is that we're a platform for work. And the first kind of work that we have gone after is transportation, but we can empower other kinds of work as well, which is what Uber AI solutions is all about the work that we are doing encompasses, training AI models, to rating both kind of voice audio responses to annotating videos from multiple sources for various players like security cameras and robots, for example, we're creating kind of judging query response pairs across various answers, AI answers. And this kind of work is available to both earners who are on the platform all around the world. We need this work done in English, and we'll need it done in Spanish, we might need it done in many other languages as well. And it's another earnings opportunity for both our owners who are in place now, but also new earners who can come to the platforms.

Some of the rules require PhDs, for example, in physics in order to get the gig done, so to speak, and the pay for that kind of work is obviously higher. So this is, we think, one is it is an opportunity to provide more work as the nature of work changes going forward. We do think that it will provide more earnings opportunities for earners and kind of -- which is terrific. And we think this can ultimately be another profitable line of business for us. Uber AI solutions is we're landing a ton of customers, and it is kind of nascent in its operations right now, but the potential that we see is enormous.

The next question comes from John Colantuoni, with Jefferies.

John Colantuoni
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

First, can you talk about any key capabilities provided by the Toast partnership? And how it fits into your broader framework for leveraging partnerships to help drive growth and profitability. And second, Prashanth, maybe you can talk about the rationale for shifting some of the non-GAAP metrics. And for the move from adjusted EBITDA to adjusted operating income, specifically does this have any reflection on your ramp in capital investments in the Autonomous Vehicle space?

Dara Khosrowshahi
CEO & Director

Yes, absolutely. So in terms of Toast, We're very, very happy about that partnership. They are a strategic partner. And obviously, Toast is kind of one of the leading point-of-sale offerings in the industry. What you will see in terms of toast is that a restaurant that is post enabled essentially will be automatically enabled for Eats as well. So the integration between Toast and Eats is going to be seamless. Menu uploads will be seamless. Picture uploads will be seamless. So we're actually using the data, the restaurant data that Toast is empowering and then moving that data directly across to Uber Eats. It's going to simplify kind of setting up your operation on Eats, it's going to simplify how you market on these and it's going to kind of save a bunch of time for those entrepreneurs who are building out our restaurant ecosystem.

So I think it's just going to be a more seamless integrated experience that gets restaurants a lot more control, a lot more flexibility and allows them to launch on each immediately. We are also hoping to help Toast grow its international presence outside of the U.S. Obviously, they're very, very strong in the U.S. our footprint outside of the U.S., as you know, is much more mature. So we think this is kind of a win-win. For us, it gives us more footprint across cost ecosystem. And then for Toast, it helps them grow outside of the U.S. as well.

Prashanth, do you want to take the second?

Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks. So yes, thanks for the question, John. So the rationale really is a reflection just as we, as a company, grow in size, scale and maturity, we want to provide investors with metrics that allow for better comparability across the alternative options they have on where to put their clients' capital and moving to an adjusted EPS model really allows for that ease of compare, and it reflects that we, as a management team, understand that there are real costs that come from depreciation from some of the software amortization, the stock-based comp, et cetera, that need to be reflected in the cost of our -- running the business as well as including really the benefits that come with reducing share count from returning the cash that this enterprise is generating to shareholders by repurchasing our shares.

So nothing more to it than really I think it's a journey that all companies go through as they scale and become more meaningful in an investor portfolio. And then personally, I think as CFO, I like having the LOB leaders held to an adjusted operating income because there are choices that they make on, for example, talent decisions and location decisions, which can impact costs, such as stock-based compensation or depreciation, and those are real cost to the business and it helps to have that also in their consideration as they think about where they want to make their investments to continue to drive top line growth, but being mindful of our commitments to continue to grow profitability. So it's really just, I think, the appropriate evolution for the company given where we are.

Balaji Krishnamurthy

All right. We'll take the last question, please.

Operator

The last question comes from Nikhil Devnani with Bernstein.

Nikhil Devnani
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

I had a couple, please. So first, I wanted to follow up on the strong results in Mobility. And I'm just wondering, did the upside primarily come from the moderation in insurance pressure? Or were there other network improvements that unlocked the growth in the quarter as well. I think the letter talks about driver supply and product uptake. So just trying to understand the relative contribution from those additional factors and how they might continue to stack in your favor into '26?

And then my second question is on AVs. Dara, can you speak a little bit about the scale and quality of real-world data that you're able to contribute? It seems like that's a core constraint for a lot of AV companies. and you can help chip away at that problem. So I'm curious to hear how you're going about tackling that.

Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks, Nikhil. I'll take the first one .And it's very specific to Mobility growth, I believe, is where you were asking. So the business is doing really well. Look, the investments we've made have -- are starting to come through at a great rate that the marketplace trends are strong. The product innovation is giving us conviction. I think what we would like investors to really focus on is this growth is trips led, and that is the healthiest way to grow the business because it comes from expanding our audience, their Mobility audience hit almost 150 million users. That is an all-time high for us. Our frequency growth was also very strong. So together, you're seeing the right drivers behind it. And it's coming from great growth on the core as well as the new product portfolio.

So we still feel very confident as we look to 2026 and beyond. I mean, the metric that we -- that keeps us excited is -- for example, looking at our top 10 markets, only 10% of the adult population uses Uber on a monthly basis. So we have -- we continue to see great opportunity to continue to penetrate the TAM.

And I think Dara has made reference to our barbell strategy and maybe just to help put that in perspective. UberX, which is really the core engine of our growth represents sort of about 2/3 of our trips. So when you look at the wins, you see the investments we've made in product innovation on the low cost, such as the Moto product, Wait and Save, the shuttle that we're running in New York, shared ride. All of those are making Uber more accessible to a broader population and helping us onboard new users, which is behind some of that audience growth.

And then the investments that we're making in premium, which include the comfort, the black, I think we've made mention that we're working to launch an Uber Elite product in the next quarter or 2. All of those help us to balance that overall profitability to allow us to continue to drive the margin expansion. So overall, we feel great about the growth. And then sort of more specifically, if we think about what happened in third quarter, I would tell you that it was -- on the trip side, we had good growth internationally, LatAm and APAC, and we also had a great European summer travel that really helped out on trips. And then just in terms of helping you bridge from the high trip growth of 21% to 19% of GB growth, as I mentioned, that growth internationally, that puts a little bit of mix pressure down because, obviously, a trips outside the U.S. and Canada are at a lower price point. So that puts a little bit of trip pressure as well.

So I wouldn't really characterize what we saw in Q3 as one-off. We're now entering our busiest quarter. Dara already made opening comments on what a spectacular weekend we had for Halloween. So we feel good that 2026 is going to be another great year for Uber, and we'll continue to be a business that has the ability to generate high mid- to high-teens growth, convert that into great profitability, convert that into great cash and then use that to reduce share count. And that's the model we want people to get behind.

Right. And then in terms of AVs and collection of real world beta, we are collecting real data as we speak. The advantage that we have is we already run a rideshare network, and it's essentially putting a vehicle in place that is appropriate for collection of this real-world data. And as you can expect, the right share use case is particular in terms of pickups and drop-offs or the commonality of ligand drop-offs, stadiums, airports, et cetera. We have -- obviously, we're working very closely with our AV partners and the feedback that we're getting from them in terms of the value of the data and trading their models is very, very positive.

And then the NVIDIA announcement for us is a marker to really scale the operations here. We are looking into building out a more robust sensor stack, for example, to get higher definition data quality across both camera and LiDAR for some of our partners. And we're not really restricted by scale because it's either a vehicle or it's a sensor suite that we can put on top of these vehicles. we've got, for example, we'll probably work with some of our fleet partners as well as some IC drivers as well. So this is something that we can scale up essentially as much as we desire in partnership with NVIDIA and our other AV partners as well. And again, we think that between the Hyperion hardware platform, NVIDIA working on for themselves, the multiple partnerships that we have, both in terms of Mobility and Delivery on AV and now our ability to collect data -- and then the SIM capabilities for many of these partners are much stronger in terms of collecting one piece of data and then running thousands of scenarios from that core piece of data. We think that's a terrific combination to bring AV to market as quickly as possible and obviously on the Uber platform. So very excited about the possibilities here.

All right. Thank you very much. Thank you for your questions, and thanks, everyone, for joining us and to the Uber teams, great quarter in terms of growth, both top line and bottom line. and hopefully, more to come. Thanks, everyone. Talk to you soon.
