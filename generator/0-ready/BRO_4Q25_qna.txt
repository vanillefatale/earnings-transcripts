Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will be coming from Gregory Peters of Raymond James.

Charles Peters
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

So I guess -- happy New Year to you all. I guess I only have one question. So I'd like to focus on all your comments regarding the 275 former teammates that left for the competitor and the $23 million of revenue that is going with them.

I guess there's a lot of questions you can ask, but I'd like to focus just on, have you changed your strategy about retaining your producers? And more importantly, can you talk about -- and I know you're not going to talk about ongoing litigation, but can you talk about, generally speaking, your legal defenses around your customers and your company IP?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Okay. So first off, what I want you to know is the way we pay our teammates and specifically producers is a mix between cash compensation and equity based on performance. And we believe that, that has worked really well over a period of time and continues to work well. So as it relates to is there something unusual or different going on or we're changing something, no, that's not the case on both fronts. I think this is a highly unusual instance, just like it was with the other large broker firms that were affected.

As it relates to the second part of the question...

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Legal defense.

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Yes. In the industry, as you know, Greg, typically, there are -- and it might be slightly different in certain states. But generally, there are nonpiracy and nonsolicitation agreements. And those typically have a 2-year period on customers and a 2-year period on hiring teammates. It also has a component on intellectual property, which is in perpetuity.

And so obviously, we can't talk about legal actions or anything that's in the legal system at the present time. But as we said in our comments earlier, there's currently some -- you can read all of it out there, let's put it that way. That's where I'd leave it.

Operator

Our next question will be coming from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan.

Jamminder Bhullar
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

First, just had a question on your comments around the sort of shift of business from E&S to standard. Are you seeing that in specific lines? Or is it more prevalent? And what are your expectations for that -- for the move of exposures from the E&S market to standard over the next year or so?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

So Jimmy, as you may know, there are accounts that I'm going to call them tweeners and tweeners, depending on the market cycle, either are in E&S or in standard. And typically, they look or lean a little bit more towards the E&S market. And many times, you see this in the smaller accounts. They're not small but smaller accounts, and those accounts might be up to $50,000 or more in premium.

But typically, when the market starts to change in property, in particular, you see standard markets will come back in and accept some of those. So again, I believe that where we saw this that we're referencing is in our binding authority business and in the Specialty Distribution. And it's too early to draw a conclusion. I don't believe one quarter is a trend. However, we've seen this movie before. So I do think that there may be some continued movement from E&S to admitted, particularly in the smaller binding authority business.

Jamminder Bhullar
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And just on your comment around...

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Jimmy, just one second before you move to the next one. Just one of the things just to keep in mind is that while accounts could, in fact, migrate from the E&S back into admitted, we continue to believe that there's going to be more insured assets though moving into the E&S space versus moving back into the admitted. So it's always kind of talked about back and forth. But if you just look at the trend over the last 10, 15, 20 years, there's more and more moving into E&S because they want the flexibility of pricing and terms.

Jamminder Bhullar
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. And so there's the secular component, obviously, but I think cyclically, there's just been a lot more business than normal that's moved into E&S the last several years. So maybe some of that goes back into standard, right, in the short term at least?

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, it can probably somewhat. You'll see it on the fringes.

Jamminder Bhullar
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And then on your comment around Howden is like they're being pretty aggressive, and other brokers have sued them as well for similar issues. Is competition picked up in general even outside of that? Or is Howden really a one-off and you're not seeing other companies being more proactive in either poaching or paying people more to add producers?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

So the answer is the start-up firm is one of many that are aggressively looking to hire people. The question is how they're doing it. And so again, as I said earlier, we're all for competition. And when we hire people from other firms, we ask them to abide by the contracts, whatever those contracts are that they have. And so there is a difference in opinion with that particular start-up here in the States. And there are others. There are others in the United States that think that way as well. But that's the story. Thank you.

Operator

And our next question will be coming from Rob Cox of Goldman Sachs.

Robert Cox
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I just wanted to ask about in the presentation, your commentary on casualty pricing. It sounds like you guys are still talking about it as, of course, seeing strong increases, but it looked like the range you provided, 3% to 6% fell a good bit from the 5% to 10% last quarter. So I just was curious to see what's driving that deceleration in casualty pricing increases and if you had any additional color to provide there.

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Sure. So once again, in a market that is changing, just a broadly broad statement, I believe that you're going to continue to see more competitive pricing across the board. So what you're seeing at least in primary business is a slight moderation of those rate increases. Remember, the biggest pressure in that area is on the excess. That has not changed because of the way the court system is -- views accidents and things like that.

So I don't -- Rob, I think it's a normal course of the market. I don't think there's some structural change that's happened or some carrier has figured out how to make so much money in casualty. That's not what I'm trying to say. But I'm just giving you what we're seeing in the quarter in terms of rate impact.

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. And Rob, with our commentary, don't read anything into that, that we're saying we expect casualty rates to go negative. So don't read anything into the trend or whatever. It's just kind of how the pricing was for the quarter. It can move around.

Robert Cox
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. So as you look forward, you would think -- I don't want to put words in your mouth, but you think like relatively similar on casualty pricing going forward?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

We think at least based on what we see, that would be the state or the case. I don't know if there's something we're not aware of or can't see right now. But based on what we see at the present time, yes.

Operator

And our next question will be coming from Tracy Benguigui of Wolfe Research.

Tracy Benguigui
Wolfe Research, LLC

I appreciate hearing your comments on contingent commissions. Can you talk about which accident years are used in that formula? I'm trying to get a sense if you're still benefiting from those harder market years.

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Tracy, it's Andy here. So a number of our calculations generally because there is -- a lot of these are around property, less on the casualty side. Normally, it's kind of shorter term in nature. Generally, it's over a 12-month horizon, but you might see that it could have a rolling 2- or 3-year inside the calculation. But in general, it's normally over kind of a 12-month horizon.

And then what we -- in our commentary, you'll see kind of movements around by quarter as we're doing ultimate true-ups to calculations back and forth and why we kind of look at them on a total basis in there. We suggest, again, you look at it kind of differently between Specialty Distribution versus Retail. The Retail is, honestly, it's a pretty consistent number as a percentage of revenue. SD will, in fact, move around by quarters, but it's an important part of our business.

Tracy Benguigui
Wolfe Research, LLC

And then just going back to the comments about those 275 producers that were approached by a competitor. Can you just walk us through the cadence of the reduction of those $23 million of revenues? Was it mostly in employee benefits so that we could see that in the fourth quarter in '26? And is it fair to assume there was no impact this quarter?

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Tracy, on those. So it was a mix of business that was more heavily weighted towards employee benefits. So you probably see more of the impact probably early in the year.

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

And it's not 275 producers...

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Right.

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

It's 275 people. A small portion of that group were producers.

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Right.

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

The vast majority of them were in nonproduction roles.

Operator

And our next question will be coming from Mike Zaremski of BMO.

Michael Zaremski
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Maybe just a question on the profit margin commentary. Andy, you said underlying margin is expected to be flattish. Just to clarify the definition of underlying, does that include contingent and exclude investment income? And it sounds like the -- which is a good flattish outcome is the result of the Accession synergies waterfalling in '26, if you think that's the right read.

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Mike, yes, I think that's -- so what we are saying is if you isolate the impact of lower investment income next year, we would say the remainder of the business will be flat. And yes, we do view that as a really strong performance next year, considering the different puts and takes that we have and having contingents down inside of there. So that would be a really good year for us.

Michael Zaremski
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. Great. And my follow-up might just be a quick yes or no, but because Tracy just asked for a clarification, but I just want to make sure that the $23 million of lost revs, that's -- that's all we're going to see from the lost employees for the most part. There's not -- it doesn't build up over time to a much larger number. I just wanted to just make sure because there's a $23 million divided by 275 employees, it's a fairly not immaterial, but small number.

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

So let's make sure we clarify that, Mike. Number one, that is the amount that they have taken at the present time. So what I'm saying is when something like this happens, which we haven't had before, they can impact retention going forward, some of that may be legally -- I'm not going to say prevent it, but run afoul with legal matters or whatever the case may be. But the answer is, at the present time, it is $23 million.

And yes, relatively speaking, at the present time, it is a big number in a regular sense. But as it relates to the overall organization, it is a small number. And your statement is correct, but we don't know what has been said to existing customers, and that will bear itself out in the next year or so.

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Mike, that's why in our commentary, we said depending upon the materiality on a quarterly basis, we may call it out just to help give an idea of how the underlying business is performing. But this will take a number of quarters to ultimately play itself through. And again, it's not that it's all one business.

Operator

And our next question will be coming from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo.

Elyse Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

My first question was on the Retail organic. I think you guys said within the guidance, right, that there should be some modest improvement from the 2.8% that you guys saw in '25. Does that, I guess, adjust out the impact of the Howden departures? Because I think you said you may or may not adjust it out? Or does that account -- would that be leaving in the $23 million impact and you might adjust out if it's larger?

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

That adjusts that out.

Elyse Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then in terms of the fourth quarter, what was the impact of the government shutdown on both Retail and Specialty Distribution? And would you expect -- are you expecting any impact in Q1 or in '26?

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Elyse. No, nothing material. Obviously, when -- especially you'll see it kind of in our flood business when you have these shutdowns. But I guess, sorry to say we're fairly adept at knowing how to manage through these since our government seems to have this as a recurring challenge at times. And so our team is really good about getting ahead of upcoming renewals, et cetera. But normally, if you have any delays, they kind of get caught up over 30, 60 days. So nothing major.

Operator

And our next question will be coming from Yaron Kinar of Mizuho.

Yaron Kinar
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

So my first question is on the Specialty Distribution organic. So I think even when we adjust for the flood revenues, organic EBITDA decreased by low single digits. You called out the greater-than-expected pressure from property CAT pricing, some binding authority business moving back to the admitted market. I assume both of those will be headwinds that remain in '26. So what offset drivers do you have that would still get the segment back up to positive organic growth in '26?

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yaron. So I think in our commentary, we highlighted a couple of things. One, we think that the organic will be challenged in the first quarter with the flood claims that we recognized in Q1 of last year. And then with the CAT property pricing is it will probably still be a little bit challenged in the second quarter. Then as we start looking into the back end of the year, we start getting the benefit of the organic growth of the Specialty Distribution businesses that have joined us from Accession.

And again, remember that had -- those businesses have very, very little CAT inside of them. There's quite a bit of casualty plus other specialty lines inside. And then obviously, there's less CAT property placed in the third quarter, and then we'll see what the fourth quarter looks like. But we feel good about the business and the outlook, probably a little bit modest in the first part of the year, but then if everything continues on with trend, it will pick up some momentum in the back end of the year.

Yaron Kinar
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Okay. And you've given us a flavor of what kind of steady-state organic should be or has been in Retail over the years in kind of the low to mid-single-digit range. I realize that it may be a bit more challenging to offer that for Specialty Distribution. But nonetheless, I'll give it a shot.

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Sorry, you broke up at the end, Yaron. Can you repeat the end of the question, please?

Yaron Kinar
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Yes. I'd just like to see if there's a steady-state organic level that you'd expect from the Specialty Distribution segment kind of the equivalent of the low to single digits you've offered for Retail.

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. When we look at that business, because you've got the E&S component to it as well as there's still admitted inside of there, it's generally going to grow faster than Retail, not all the time, and you're going to have kind of different periods. But we would normally think about that being a slightly faster-growing business than our Retail.

Operator

And our next question will be coming from Mark Hughes of Truist.

Mark Hughes
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Yes. The procedure when you lose the teammates, going back to the Howden issue, how quickly would they change, say, the broker of record and so the business would shift immediately? I think, Powell, you had alluded to you didn't know kind of what conversations they might have had with other clients maybe positioning themselves for the renewal. But what's the usual cadence where you learn about how much has shifted over just so we can think about what that $23 million might end up being as it progresses throughout the year?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Well, Mark, there's 2 parts. So as you know, people do business with people that they like and they trust. And depending on how this story is presented, sometimes, and we've run into this already, they were said -- they were told one thing and then the customer determines that maybe it happened a little differently.

And so having said that, there -- in our experience or hearing what the scenario is here, we have seen a group of accounts, which is the $23 million in question, that move right away. And we believe that those discussions occurred with them either before the departure or right around that time. We don't know exactly, and that will bear itself out.

But having said that, there are other people that when presented with the scenario, they may end up thinking that they need to review their program, their placement. Sometimes they would go to an RFP, not all, but I'm saying some. And some of that may be honest and honorable and some of that may have something else embedded in it, and we just don't know.

And so we think about how do you deliver better customer outcomes. And I have been hard-pressed to determine at the present time how the start-up presents better customer outcomes to those insureds. So ultimately, that will pan itself out. But we don't have a way -- it would be purely speculative, Mark, and we're not going to do that on what that number could ultimately be.

But what I'm saying is we are rehiring teammates in the affective areas. We are engaging capabilities across the platform to continue or to show these customers the -- how we can bring -- have the best customer outcomes. And I'm very pleased with the engagement of our team across the entire organization.

Mark Hughes
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Appreciate that. And then, Powell, I think you had said you anticipate CAT property rates might decline modestly from 4Q levels. Do you think the market has pretty close to bottoming?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

I don't -- I'm not going to say that, Mark, and let me tell you why. You have this really unique dynamic because you have all these issues with convective storms and fires and all this other stuff. And yet when the wind doesn't blow in Florida, as an example, you have this great pressure on rates. And as you know, it's a little bit like a pendulum and the pendulum usually swings too far one way and too far the other way.

Well, the rates, quite honestly, we would all agree, probably were too high, and we don't control the pricing, the carriers do. But then all of a sudden, when it becomes profitable again, and it looks really good, it brings everybody back in. So I believe that we're going to continue to have some pretty significant competition on those rates in the near to intermediate term. And I would typically say that really exists down between now and May or June, and then you get into hurricane season. So I would tend to say that I think it's still going to be quite competitive between now and then.

Operator

And our next question will be coming from Josh Shanker of Bank of America.

Joshua Shanker
BofA Securities, Research Division

Obviously, you were very proud and have a good view of the long-term success for your business, but someone much smarter than me said that the hard market is an elevator and the soft market is an escalator. When you're looking at the dynamics of the market and you have a view of what the long-term growth rate of this industry is, do you believe we're entering into an extended period of suboptimal growth?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Well, I think that we are entering a more normal historically growth rate in the industry. And so I don't -- I wouldn't say it the way you just said it, Josh. I also think it's very interesting, the weight that people place on organic growth versus other important metrics like cash flow and margins. And so I have this -- and Andy and I have this healthy debate where we discuss with our team, the more and more of the changes that occur in GAAP, the further it moves away from real cash. Doesn't mean that it's wrong. I mean that's the SEC's deal and they figure it out and everybody, but -- or the generally accepted accounting principles.

But what I would say is we think about it is how do we grow our business, how do we do that profitably? How do we reward those teammates, all of our teammates, enable them to create wealth over a long period of time for helping us grow the business, and then how do we translate those revenues and earnings into cash, as you saw at 24.6% for the year and then use that to either buy businesses, hire more teammates, acquire our stock or something else that -- those are the 3 that come right to mind.

So I believe it's -- this is exactly, Josh, what Andy and I have been saying for the last 12 months, which was more of a return to the normal growth rates historically seen in the brokerage space.

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Josh, the other thing it's -- again, it's interesting to us, I think, the way in which people write about the market. If you think about the retail space and just think about our business for a second, the large majority of what we place there is admitted markets, right? And those rates, they had to come down from where they were during kind of that '22, '23, '24 period just because of inflation and everything else. They've kind of leveled back out. They're kind of normal again.

And so we don't see anything else unusual. So we don't see like this significant like softening market maybe that people are writing about. That's not what we're seeing in the rates on the admitted side, actually feels fairly stable and the economy feels pretty good to us right now. Even though the headlines may potentially indicate something else, that's not actually what we see. The place where you see more of the volatility is over in the E&S space. But it seems nobody talks about casualty continues to just keep going up, though. And casualty is a really large part of the marketplace.

And so look, we feel good about the backdrop. The numbers can move around again for anybody by quarter. But when we think about our business and heading into 2026, we feel really good about our ability to continue to capture market share and grow net new business. And that's kind of the key performance metrics that we focus on in -- across the entire organization. So we don't hear that -- we don't hold that -- maybe that potential dire view that you kind of put out there. That's not our perspective on the market.

Joshua Shanker
BofA Securities, Research Division

Well, I don't know if it's dire, but I just want to follow-up on one thing that Powell said about that investors don't focus enough on cash flow, and I agree that's true. But do you believe that over the next 3-year period that Brown & Brown's business can outgrow the organic pace of the rest of the industry? Are you in a position -- or it just doesn't matter, cash flow will be the guiding factor for how we operate our business.

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Josh, we don't think that's actually the right question, if you don't mind me coming back at this one because the organic is only one part of the equation. One of the things that we've been saying for an extended period of time is you have to also look at contingent as part of our business model in total. Otherwise, you get kind of a false understanding of how the business is performing.

Look at last year, we grew the top line, total revenues 23%. We grew our cash by 24%. The organic sure didn't grow that level, right? So you have to put contingents inside. Maybe look -- maybe our business is just different than everybody else. But when you think about Brown & Brown, you have to put the contingents inside of it because you're going to have scenarios where the organic will be down and the contingents will be up, right? And the contingents are very profitable for us ultimately because these businesses should really be valued off of cash, not organic.

And the question is, how can you grow your cash over time? We grew at 24% last year to $1.450 billion. That's an incredible year. And just look back to the last 10 years at how we've grown our cash, right? And it's a combination of our acquisitions, organic and contingents.

Operator

And our next question will come from Andrew Andersen of Jefferies.

Andrew Andersen
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Into '26 and recognizing the lost headcount, is there a scenario where you actually have a margin benefit as you're not incurring the comp and ben costs, but you are keeping the revenues? Are you thinking about that in underlying margin guidance?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

I think that what I want you to understand is we are rehiring teammates that display the characteristics that we look for to deliver very creative solutions to our customers. So some of those people are being hired in those markets effective. Some may be hired elsewhere.

But in the near term, technically, that could be the case, but we don't believe that it's going to have a significant impact or a material impact because we are hiring people back. So I think the question is the right question, but I don't want you to go away and say there's some hidden bonus in here. It's -- we believe it's immaterial.

Andrew Andersen
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And traditionally, I thought of you all is not really doing team lifts, but if there's an effort to replace these folks kind of quickly, is that strategy kind of contemplated here?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

No, we don't think really that way. We think about hiring good people and bringing them on to the team. And so I don't like to use the term never or always, but that has not really been our thought process.

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Andy, keep in mind our comment earlier because I think maybe some people have believed that it was whatever, 200, 250, 275, those were all producers. That represents teammates across the board. So that's service, account executives, et cetera.

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

We'll take one more question. Is that what we're going to do...

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

We'll run it. We got a few more in the queue.

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Still more in the queue. Okay, go ahead.

Operator

Our next question will be coming from Alex Scott of Barclays.

Taylor Scott
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I wanted to ask about the incentive commissions. And I guess we've seen some of the national carriers who are trying to be a little more disciplined in the face of more competition beginning to have lower premium growth numbers. And so I just wanted to understand if we should expect any impact from maybe volume-based incentive commissions being impacted by that?

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

And Alex, is that just an overall comment on the market? Or is it related to something specific when you asked that?

Taylor Scott
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Yes, I'll try to be more clear. We're seeing some national carriers have very low premium growth numbers at this point because of competition. And I'm trying to...

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes.

Taylor Scott
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Understand if in 2026, your incentive commissions could be negatively impacted by that.

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Always a potential for that. I think you saw some of that actually in 2025, Alex, that we called out in the third and fourth quarter because the carriers are always moving around different measurement targets that could be on persistence or on growth. So yes, those are some of the dynamics going on.

Taylor Scott
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. But is there anything embedded in sort of what you commented on your Retail organic that include that? Or is that something that could be incremental? To help me understand.

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

That includes our commentary unless we get something unusual throwing out that we don't know about.

Taylor Scott
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And then I wanted to see if we could circle back on Accession and just see if you would be willing to provide any commentary around how that performed in 4Q and its contribution to revenue. And I know we probably should care and look at more cash flow. But for Accession in particular, just thinking through the different pieces of guidance you've given in the past, I wanted to understand how the growth is going there.

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. I would say, good for the businesses. So we're very pleased with the performance of the businesses inside there. We're extremely, extremely pleased with how all our new teammates are leaning in, which is wonderful to see in there.

The item on the growth in the quarter when we called out the $405 million versus the $430 million versus $450 million. Again, that was just an estimate we had going into the quarter. We had to refine revenue recognition. But nothing changes full year how we think about the business. Everything is going really well and coming along with integration. So we're extremely pleased.

Operator

And our next question will be coming from Meyer Shields of Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.

Meyer Shields
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Two quick questions. First, Andy, the $15 million of adjustment-related contingents, is that a fourth quarter issue? Is that where we should expect the drop-off?

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

No, we'll probably see that more kind of spread between the third and fourth quarters of next year, Meyer.

Meyer Shields
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And second, just to clarify, I know you said that the Retail segment should have organic growth better than the 2.8%. Is that comment also applicable to Specialty Distribution?

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

We would expect that the organic growth also would improve for Specialty Distribution during the year, yes.

Operator

And our next question will be coming from Brian Meredith of UBS.

Brian Meredith
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Two questions here. The first one, you called out multiyear policies as a headwind in Retail growth again this quarter. Maybe you can quantify that. And is that going to continue to be a headwind in 2026?

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Brian, yes, we wouldn't quantify that level of granularity. I think we included that in our commentary about the 100 to 150 basis points in addition to incentives and some other projects. Those are always kind of moving around by quarters. Remember, if they're a headwind this year, remember, they come up for renewal next year.

Brian Meredith
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Got you. Okay. And then second question, Powell, this is more for you. If I think about going back and when we transition into these soft cycles, I found that historically, you do get these talent wars, and this is obviously a little unusual what's going on with Howden. But as I think about here going forward, is that a correct characterization? And maybe is there likely to be maybe potential pressure on margins, not only Brown & Brown for the industry is perhaps SMB has got to grow at a faster rate than organic revenue growth given just the talent war going on right now to try to sustain growth?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

That's possible. Yes, I mean I'm not trying to be flippant, but yes, your thought process is fair on that. That could impact the industry, yes.

R. Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Brian, just the other thing, this industry has always been competitive, though. I mean it's been competitive for many decades. And so I think to our earlier comments, it's why we're very thoughtful about our compensation plans, both on cash and equity and how that creates long-term wealth for our teammates. And we continue to invest across the entire organization. But I don't think that like all of a sudden, like competition just showed up in the last 6 months. It's been here for decades.
