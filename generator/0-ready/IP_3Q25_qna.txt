Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research Partners.

Mark Weintraub
Seaport Research Partners

Congrats progress in a tough environment. Kind of first question for me, and I heard Lance's explanation in terms of kind of the opportunities in EMEA. But one thing I'm just trying to really understand is the difference between what you're going to be doing in EMEA versus North America and sort of 2 pointed -- or 2 points on that.

One, so there was a lot of opportunity in North America to take out excess capacity that had developed in the system, and you basically didn't have to walk away from any business. So there wasn't a negative commercial impact that, say, is related with Savannah for a lot of the stuff done earlier. Are there those types of opportunities in EMEA? Or is it more the second type, where it's going to be improvement over time, tough decisions being made?

And then second, in North America, there also had been commercial decisions made a few years prior that had hurt and essentially, you're able to make changes, and we've seen lots of benefit from that. Are there things like that in EMEA, too? Or is that -- how is the commercial opportunity in EMEA different from North America?

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Those are both great questions, Mark. Thank you. So on the cost front, it is a little bit different, right? We don't have the same kind of magnitude of excess mill capacity or paper capacity that we had in North America. That said, there's more capacity out in the field. As you think about the box system and underutilization in the box system, we did not have a ton of underutilized capacity in the box system per se.

We certainly found it as we have implemented the lighthouses. And so those 2 things were true in North America. In Europe, we definitely have excess box capacity as we look at the European footprint. And then on the mill side, what we have is we have a pretty considerable amount of our capacity that isn't going into the box business. And so we have to really look at the economics around that and make really good choices.

One of the things that's different in Europe than in North America is that complexity. So where we found a lot of complexity in North America was at the corporate center, as you kind of define it. So call it the Memphis corporate center. And that really then bled into the field that added complexity from a product, from a customer standpoint, policies, procedures, investment, slow investment, those sorts of things.

That all still exists very similarly in Europe markets. The difference is it sits kind of in the above-country structure. There's a very complex above-country structure that we talked about last quarter, Lance talked about again this quarter that we've already announced and we're in consultation to address.

And so what I would say is, on a proportional basis, the cost opportunity is as large or larger, frankly, when you just look at the cost structure. The difference are a little bit in the buckets that we find. Lance's there is something you want to add?

Lance Loeffler
Senior VP & CFO

No.

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Okay. Excellent. Mark, does that answer that question for you?

Mark Weintraub
Seaport Research Partners

Yes. No, that's super helpful. And then just 1 other follow-up in parks I'm getting this asked from some investors wanting me to ask it. So I'm going to ask on their behalf. In the bridging to '27, so I guess we're kind of starting if we need like another $1.4 billion if we have like the $3.6 billion run rate already identified. How much of that would be cost takeout commercial? And does commercial have to include some price now that prices have gone down in Europe? Or how to think about that part of the equation?

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Yes, absolutely. Mark, first, I realized I didn't answer your second question, so let me get to that. So on the commercial decisions, there are not those same magnitude of commercial decisions that have to be made in Europe, right? So the issue that we had in North America is that we had priced a number of contracts dramatically underneath the market. And as you saw the different pieces, we reversed that, both in terms of the capturing the margin and now winning market share, which I think is very important.

In Europe, we have some commercial challenges in Europe, but it's more of actually focusing the resource. We have an awesome set of resource in Europe around the commercial side in terms of customer focus, helping our customers through their value chain and driving innovation. So that's a real skill that we have in Europe, but it's probably too diffused. And we've got to focus it more on those large key customers that we call our [ ADs ] customers. So that -- so Mark, I'm sorry, remind me of the question you asked before that?

Lance Loeffler
Senior VP & CFO

Of the $1.4 billion.

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

How much is cost and how much is commercial, yes. So of that, Mark, it's on a net basis, it's about 50-50. On a gross basis, as you'd imagine, it's more cost because you got inflation, right? So -- and to your point, yes, there is some price baked into that. As we have said all along, we have an expectation that we would get to mid-cycle pricing in North America by 2027.

We still believe that to be true. That's probably I'm guessing 1 price rev away, and I would guess, if you would see an improvement in the U.S. market, that's probably likely. We don't have that built into, as you saw in our bridge of 2026. We specifically didn't talk about benefits from market growth, from price or from future actions that we haven't executed yet. So we don't have any of that baked into that $3.6 billion that I just outlined.

To get to the $5 billion, yes, you would expect that, and we would expect a modest rebound in Europe. And you see that being tested constantly, right? You've seen that be tested 2 or 3 times this year. It's gone up and retracted a little bit. Look, about the bottom 25% of paper producers in Europe are in a very, very tough position right now, right? On a cash basis, they're in a very tough position.

I'm not foolish enough to believe that there's going to be some kind of mass decision-making to take out capacity. You see a lot of resilience in terms of holding on by privately held long-term family companies. And so I'm not looking for a miracle there, and we should not. We should be executing as we can. We would expect, however, modest price improvement over that time frame.

Our next question is going to come from the line of Matthew McKellar with RBC Capital Markets.

Matthew McKellar
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Just to follow-up on really the other side of that North American box shipments comping positive in September, seemingly again, October is quite positive. You made the comment that you expect above-market performance in Q4 and 2026. Could you maybe refresh us on what kind of volume growth and volume performance versus market you've assumed in getting to the 2027 targets?

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Yes. So all along, we've assumed a pretty soft market, right? So our assumptions going into this year were plus 1% to 1.5 % in the U.S., we had more robust assumptions coming in Europe, which were disappointing so far. As we look forward, our expectation would be 1% to 1.5% in North America and 1% to 2% in Europe over time. As you know, Europe has a stronger secular trend around moving from other materials, plastics as an example, to fiber and a stronger consumer component related to that. So that's why you've seen kind of stronger growth over time in the European market.

We would expect those trends to continue. Very importantly, when we sat and talked about adjusting our 2027 target, and we all recognize that we've gotten some questions already on, hey, why did you do that now? It just was obvious. It was obvious that the $500 million that we've lost this year from the combination of volume and price, unless you expect a major pickup in volume to the tune of the U.S., you have to claw back a couple of points additionally and the same in Europe, unless you expect that over a 2-year period, those benefits are going to get pushed out. And so we thought it was appropriate to capture that and not kid ourselves or anybody else around that and focus on what we can control.

And so our expectation, Matt, is that we're talking the 1% to 1.5% in North America and the 1% to 2% in Europe.

Matthew McKellar
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Very clear. And just as a second question, last for me. Could you maybe just provide a bit of a perspective on the strategic rationale and high-level economics for the Riverdale conversion and what kind of returns you might be targeting with that investment?

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Yes, you bet, Matt. So on -- relative to Riverdale, importantly, we mentioned it in the script, but the decision on Savannah, as you looked at that, right, we had all the economics that screened about Savannah and why we didn't want to put an incremental $300 million into that, but also the opportunity at Riverdale was really around moving to lightweighting, as you know. And so that's about a $250 million investment plus or minus. And we would expect near 20% returns on that.

And so it's a really attractive spin from a business that, for the long -- for a very, very long time, and it definitely was going to be under its cost of capital to a business that has an attractive future and attractive return on capital.

Our next question is going to come from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.

George Staphos
BofA Securities, Research Division

Congratulations on the progress. Andy, I guess first question I had for you, if we look at the change in the guidance for this year, and we appreciate the update, the free cash flow number for us, from our vantage point moved a decent amount. I think it was $100 million to $300 million positive for the year, and it's now a comparable deficit. What were the primary areas in terms of the movement there? Was it just purely the cost at the actions that you took its event, et cetera, that move that? Or are there other factors there?

And then related, I just want a clarification on the answer you were giving to Mark earlier. As we think about the commercial and the cost out targets that you initially had in your March guidance and now in the current guidance, have those figures actually changed? Or are they still the same? And then I had 1 follow-on.

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Yes. Let me do the second first. No, those have not changed. So that's consistent on the second question. On the first question on cash flow, it really -- it's vastly the slowdown in the market, right? So that $500 million -- if you look at the $500 million of profit, actually, it's a little more than $500 million of profit that we would have expected to have captured if the market had been at the expectations we talked about at our Investor Day, we would be right on, if not a little bit better on the cash flow from a cash flow perspective.

So it really is attached to the market. There are some incremental costs that are higher than we expected because we've been more aggressive in terms of timing of some of the actions, but it's not a giant number. It's not a huge number on a relative basis. It's probably $50 million to $100 million more than we had expected to spend.

And importantly, right, we have a decision to make, and I've made that decision, which is not to back away from the transformation plan, right? We have the balance sheet, we have the proceeds from GCF. We've sold a number of smaller businesses. We have the operating improvements that we have. And I think it would be a fundamental mistake to slow down our transformation by pulling back on CapEx. I really do believe that.

And so as long as we're in the area that we're in, we need to move at full speed. You're seeing exactly what happens when we get this right in North America. It's not linear. It's not perfect. It's not going to be perfect and it's not going to be linear. But the level of improvement that we can drive in this business, when we get the asset balance correct, and we are investing in the commercial front end of this business, you can see what happens.

If you just kind of put North America in perspective, you go back a year ago, we were losing market share. We were getting crushed on volume, and we were seeing declining incremental margins, right? And so therefore, we were cutting capital. We were in a spiral that you cannot be in, in a business.

We have reversed that spiral in 18 months. I mean, it's -- I'm incredibly proud of that team. EBITDA is up 40% year-over-year through the third quarter, 40% year-over-year, and we've gone from losing market share to winning market share. And we will finish this year above our cost of capital in North America. That's a pretty awesome turnaround. Europe will be harder. I'm not a Pollyanna, right? There's more hard work to be do. It takes longer and it costs more. But the playbook is the same, and we're going to go after it. And so we're going to stick to this. So that's critically important.

George Staphos
BofA Securities, Research Division

I appreciate that, Andy. I guess my second question, and it's kind of a 2-parter, but they are tied together. You did see -- and congratulations to you, at least in the results in terms of a pickup in box shipments in September, and you're looking for the positive in the fourth quarter, as you mentioned. What's been driving that? Are there any particular end markets where you that the new IP approach is particularly gaining traction as we're seeing it. And then the related question, bigger picture, if I look at the results you've put up that some of your peers have put up, the narrative is, everyone is -- I shouldn't say everyone, but individually, each of the companies is really trying to produce to market you're seeing your margins do fairly well, 17% or better, but there's a lot of volume being sort of reintroduced back into the market, which means there's another portion of the market that's really not earning a very high margin.

Is that a comparatively good place for IP shareholders to be? And/or relative to where you were back in March, a more dangerous place for IP shareholders to be where there's a lot of players out there with a lot of volume and not necessarily a lot of margin?

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Thank you. There was a lot in that question. So if I don't -- if I miss it, help me out here a little bit.

George Staphos
BofA Securities, Research Division

We know where to find you.

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

So relative to what's going on in the marketplace. So first of all, we just -- we don't comment on competitors ever. That's just not a good thing to do. And so we won't do that. Everyone's got to make their own choices. Relative to our perspective, in terms of rightsizing ourselves and focusing on the right kind of markets, we think we're getting the balance correct there. And in terms of the things, we're trying to utilize our strengths in the marketplace. And so where we are winning over market is really on select initiatives around very specific customers in those markets that we find attractive.

Now as you imagine, we touch pretty much every market, budget our sheer size and scale. We tend to be, I'm going to call it, medium-sized to larger customers that tends to be, but we have lots of great smaller customers all over the world. Our strength in the fruits and vegetables and protein has absolutely shown up. And we've gotten very -- we've gotten highly engaged on strategic customers.

We're doing -- we're just putting a lot more time, energy and resource into those customers that we believe are critical to our future. And so I'm not going to go into the specifics around those, but it really is customer centricity. It's about putting resource on the most attractive customers that fit our business model.

To your second question around what's happening in the overall marketplace and margin, again, I'm going to speak for us and not speak for anybody else. I think what's happened in the industry just collectively is at times people have chased the incremental cash benefits of getting incremental volume, right? So in our world, if you've got excess capacity and you're sitting on fixed cost and you bring in something, we sit in North America, as an example, we sit at a 65% to 70%, material -- what I call material margin.

So think of contribution margin, not including direct labor. That means that the next dollar in on our average piece of business comes in at $0.70 or the next dollar out leaves at $0.70 of profit either way. And so even if a competitor picks it up at $0.20 off, right, at 20% off and they pick up $0.50, in the very short term, that sugar high feels good. right? And you see that, and you've seen that play out a lot over the years. I've looked at this a lot of kind of how people have played this. And what that does is it stops us and others from actually doing the right thing. And that means that eventually, that business that you bring in has to be invested in. It's going to require capacity. It's going to require investment at some point. And all of a sudden, that sugar high goes away. And so -- and then that kind of gets passed around.

What we are doing is we are having the discipline to not do business in that way. What other people do is up to them. But we're going to have our own discipline to go after markets that can earn an attractive return on capital. Importantly, in that, the 3 pillars of our strategy, they really matter in concert. Number one, have an advantaged cost position. A huge piece of what we're doing is driving cost out of the system, so we have an advantaged cost. That does not mean that we intend to sell the lowest price. What that means is we have optionality for margin expansion and reinvestment that competitors can't if we have a lower cost position.

Second, around the customer to customer experience. We just talked about that we're invested heavily. We've added 22% more salespeople this year than we had last year. We changed our pay for performance. We've changed our innovation process. All of those things are around really driving that customer experience. That's backed up by major improvements in quality and on-time delivery that our customers are noticing.

And then finally, we want to have a relative strength in the markets that matter to us, and we're going to invest in that. So if we do that, that will have discipline. If other competitors decide that they need to get their house in order, that's for them to decide.

Our next question is going to come from the line of Mike Roxland with Truist Securities.

Michael Roxland
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the progress in a difficult environment. I want to follow-up with you on the closures of Riceboro and Savanna. And can you help us understand the EBITDA benefit associated with those closures. Because when I look at previous closes, like Orange and Red River, you guys called out specific either adjusted EBIT or adjusted EBITDA benefits associated with those mills. But I don't believe anything was highlighted in your recent SEC filing for those mills. So that's question 1.

And question 2, just are you now at a point in your U.S. mill system where you can't reallocate tons and need to actually make mill investments, such as what you're doing at Riverdale? And really what I'm trying to get at is you can't reallocate the tons from Savannah elsewhere in your system then there might be a negative EBITDA impact in 4Q and maybe early 2026. So any color you can provide would be helpful.

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Yes. Let me do this and then Lance, if you want to add some color to it, please do. Let me talk -- I'm going to split Savannah and Riceboro because they're different. So with Savannah was principally shipping into the export market, and what I would call the low value piece of it, which was effectively an outlet on volume. And when I look at that and you look at it over a cycle, we did a ton of work on this. What you see is that at some points in the cycle, you are making positive cash, right? You're actually creating cash.

But through the cycle, you are not, right? You are actually -- it is not generating above its cost of capital. So we were destroying value. And it requires an ever-increasing capital investment to go into the system. And shutting Savanna down and then exiting what I'll call that low-value export market, it's effectively a push, right, on an EBITDA basis. It's effectively a push.

But very importantly, right, you're talking about something that on a replacement asset value is north of $1 billion, right, maybe quite a bit north of $1 billion if you had to build that mill from scratch. You would never build that mill from scratch to service that market, right? You'd never do that. And so on an ROIC basis, it's a huge win.

However, you do have that sugar high comment that I just mentioned a moment ago, that's part of the thing that you get trapped in, right? You get trapped in that when the export market taught like a little bit like I remember last year, we had a few months where it was really good, it feels great. And then when it comes off, you really hate it. And so -- and you get caught in that trap and then you just say no, we have to look at this from a long-term return on investment, what's the right thing to do for capital employed. And so that trade that I talked about with Riverdale is a really, really important trade.

And those are the kind of decisions that we're making throughout the company, right? That's really important here. And I know how many moving parts are in this. And the transformation is, again, they're not clean, but that's the kind of stuff that we're doing to drive this business.

Riceboro is different. Riceboro was a mill that simply was never going to have the cost position to compete. And so it made sense to move that volume to other mills, and so that's modestly positive. But to be clear, that's a very small mill.

Michael Roxland
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Got you. And now, Andy, you had now -- it's very helpful. Are you at out a point in your U.S. mill system, though, where you can't reallocate tons? You need to make -- you actually need to make no investments, such as what you're doing at Riverdale?

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Yes. I mean in terms of are we going to take more capacity out, not in the near future, that's for sure. The -- if you look at the drive now, you get a few things that are -- we're very focused on in the mill system. Number 1 is, as I talked about last quarter, and I referenced modestly in this quarter, we have a lot of costs that are in the system from the lack of investment over 10 years. And we started this last year, and we're going to keep going, and that's why I made the comment on sticking to the strategy.

If we invest aggressively in that mill system, we can capture a huge chunk of that kind of $400-ish million that I think is in that -- that's kind of -- it's waste in the system that when the mills are running well, you can get a huge chunk of that $400 million. You're not going to get all of it. There's always going to be things like the Vaillant Gas situation, it stinks and you hate to have it. It's taken way longer to address than we thought it would. Those things are going to happen in these big complex systems. But what you shouldn't have are things that are breakdowns and issues from maintenance that's being deferred.

And I think our investments, we can go and capture a whole bunch of those, as you know, right, those aren't -- those take time. You have to invest and they take time. But over the next couple of years, we should be able to get the vast majority of that to our bottom line.

The second part that I think is very important is the reinvestment in ongoing productivity. If you look at the last 10 years in our business, and you were looking for any kind of what I'd call net productivity, it hasn't been there. As a matter of fact, it's gone the other way. And we all know the math around that. If you can get -- if you can -- if the market is growing in that 1% to 1.5% range, and you can get modest market share gains over time, that's good.

If you can get that, plus productivity over time, you knock the socks off. And so what we need to do is get that productivity engine moving. And we know how to do that. It's just a matter of -- it is going to take some time. So it's those 2 pieces together.

Michael Roxland
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And just 1 quick one. Just you've mentioned accelerating cost actions in North America. You sold the bags business. You mentioned just now outsourcing a large portion of your IT support. Can you comment on the EBITDA savings you expect to achieve from those moves? And are there similar types of actions you can potentially take in North America if the market remains challenging as you sort of indicated in 2026?

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Yes, we've captured those in our -- in the numbers that we laid out. So if you look at the bridge, most of that stuff that we've talked about will be realized. Most of it will be realized in '26. It's not there will be a tail of some, right? There'll be some tail that will roll to 2027. So all of the different things, the mill closures, the IT, et cetera, those are in that bridge that I put out for the most part. It's probably 3 quarters or more that are in that bridge. And so you'll get a little -- you get 20%, 25% that will roll over into 2027 somewhere in that neighborhood.

In terms of future actions, we still have a long way to go, right? We know that. But in terms of kind of the big structural stuff in North America, we've gotten after an awful lot of it. And now we have to drive those things to resolution. We've got to go after the cost structure in the mill system. There's still more overhead to address. And then obviously, we're just starting the journey in Europe.

Our next question is going to come from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup.

Anthony Pettinari
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Just following up on Mike's question, with Savanna and Riceboro closed and let's assume Riverdale comes up, what percentage of IP containerboard production in North America will go to an IP box plant? What's your integration rate going to be? And then what percentage would be exported offshore, understand that is going to bounce around a little bit, but just on a normalized basis, like can you give us any sense there?

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Yes. It's about 90% that will be consumed in our box system, plus or minus. We have partners in the box world in North America, and we'll still be -- we still have some export that goes out. And the export that we have, we like that business. It's highly strategic. It's profitable. It earns its cost of capital and above. And it's an attractive piece of business. And obviously, our partners. They've been long-term partners, they're great partners, and they're going to continue to be. And then the export piece is, it's like 6%, 7%, somewhere in there.

Anthony Pettinari
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

No, that's very helpful. And then I guess, just looking at the mill system exiting the year, are operating rates where you want them to be? Or are they still maybe a little bit loose because the demand is weak? Or are you going to be running tight until Riverdale comes online? And then just given the kind of volatility in demand and weakness in demand, how should we think about the sort of timing of Riverdale? Is that something that could get flexed sooner, later, or just any thoughts there?

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Yes. We're okay in terms of our capacity utilization. So if you look at operating rates, we're okay there. We are going to make sure that from a paper strategy perspective, if we get a bump up in activity, we're being very mindful this has been a soft market. If the market bounces back and you get a quick pop back, our paper strategy, we want to be smart about that, absolutely, as we drive productivity into the system. And look, if we're driving productivity into the system, what that does then that allows us to capture that 1%, 1.5% growth without adding fixed costs. And that's where that magic is that's really, really important.

And so I'm not awful worried about that. That the plan here on Riverdale is late next year is where that's really going to start being up and going. And we think that, that's good timing and certainly positioned well relative to a growing segment of the marketplace.

And our final question today comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies.

Philip Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Europe is clearly more challenging than expected coming in the year. I think you and your peer have both talked about perhaps 50% to 75% of the non-integrated tons in Europe are operating at uneconomic levels, maybe not even cash flow positive. I believe your Europe business is about 40% to 50% of the paper you make you're selling into the open market or you trade tons. So can you kind of let us know if that business, one, is cash flow positive or EBITDA positive at current levels? Is that a business you want to be in, in the medium term? And is there a good way to think about your unintegrated and integrated business in Europe, is there like a massive spread in terms of margins?

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Yes. Good question. So specific to the non-internally consumed product, we're evaluating that whole thing. We're going through that right now. And frankly, it's not even necessarily tied to the economics of it just tied to the economics of it because it's really around the strategy, how it fits with our business. In terms -- I mean, if you look at it right now, Europe in total is, from a cash flow basis, right, is using cash and because of the restructuring that we're going to entail on it.

So we do have to restructure that, so we're going to do that. I do believe, however -- I know, however, that we have pockets of our business, both in the mill system and in our box system that are losing money on a cash basis. There's no doubt about that. And so as we go through that, that has to be rectified and through commercial and/or cost actions to get to an attractive return on capital.

And so in terms of the split, we haven't talked about that. We haven't gone into that level of detail, and I don't think it's good to do that. I don't think competitively it's good to share that kind of information. But we know where the pockets of profit and loss are. We know we have a road map that we're working on. Obviously, anything and everything we do in Europe has to have the discipline around the consultation process, and we need to follow that appropriately. And so we'll do that in all of our public comments and all of our private engagements.

Philip Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

That's helpful. And then appreciate Europe is a little newer for all of us. Lance, did you mentioned on the prepared remarks that you're going through a work [ council ] process in Eastern Europe, Nordic and Italy. Can you give a little more perspective what's out there in terms of potential closures? Are those box plants? Is that mills? Just kind of help us size how quickly could you see that? And perhaps, Andy, as you kind of accelerate this restructuring in Europe, how quickly you're going to move in? And could we see some uplift perhaps in 2026? Or is this more of a '27 event where you see the big inflection in terms of cost-out savings?

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Yes. So Phil, we have to dance carefully on this topic, right? And the reason I say that is there is a highly defined process in Europe around consultation. And so what that means is we're working hand-in-hand with the works councils and with the regulators to go through that process in a very detailed way. And I appreciate the fact that we all want to put a number out there and put a date out there and talk about what's going to happen. That is different than the U.S. And so what I'll say, and then, Lance, you can add any color that you want is we are going to move aggressively toward rightsizing Europe. We have to, right? As does everybody else, given the market conditions. Everyone's going to make their own choices around that, but the marketplace is going to have to decide what they're going to do. We are going to be aggressive about getting ourselves in the right economic position. That being said, it has to be in conjunction with the regulations and the laws and the practices in Europe.

Yes. I don't have anything to add. I think you covered it in terms of being aggressive about the actions that we take under the appropriate circumstances without getting wrapped around the axle. That's probably as much as we can say.

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Yes. But just expect it, Phil, we're going to move, right? The stuff that we have, we have talked about already. That's in consultation. We're going to go through that process the right way. But we know the magnitude of what we have to address.

Philip Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And sorry, I just sneak one more in, something perhaps you could talk about a little more freely. Good to see progress on box shipments and you're calling up 1%. That certainly appears to be outpacing the market. Given the line of sight and perhaps on the wins you already have in North America on the box side, is there a good way to think about relative outperformance that we could hope to expect in North America for you guys next year and some of the wins that you've had in terms of what type of customer mix of business?

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Yes. So based on what we're looking at right now with known wins and losses, we think that number is kind of 2%. So you pick your market number. but we think we can outpace the market by a couple of points in 2026 in North America.

I will now turn the call over to Andy Silvernail for closing comments.

Andrew Silvernail
CEO & Chairman

Well, thank you very much. Thank you, everybody, for being with us on this transformation journey. The work and the focus on 80/20 and on the 3 pillars of our strategy are critically important, and we're working it, and we're working it hard. I'm delighted to see the progress in North America and what that team is doing. Obviously, the North American team is facing headwinds that we didn't expect, but we're being aggressive with the realities of that. And so we're getting after it.

In Europe, it's been a tough market. No doubt about it, right? If we look at the -- both in terms of volume and price, it's been meaningfully more difficult than we had expected. But the same thing holds true. We are moving forward with the same playbook, with the same level of aggressiveness that we have in North America, and we understand the challenge, and we understand the need to get that business in the right place.

So I want to thank you for your support. I want to thank you for your attention. And very importantly, I want to thank the IP team for the incredible work that they're doing in North America and in EMEA. So thank you very much, everybody.
