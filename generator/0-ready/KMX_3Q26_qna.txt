Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.

Sharon Zackfia
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Good to hear you again, Tom, on a conference call, and welcome David to the world of CarMax conference calls. Yes. I guess maybe if you could give some color on the magnitude of the GPU reset that you're looking to see here in the February quarter? And then as you look at the business kind of, I guess, with a fresher perspective, are there any customer cohorts that you can delve into where you think somehow CarMax has become a bit less competitive or a bit less attractive? And what's the game plan to win those customers back?

Enrique Mayor-Mora
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Sharon, it's Enrique. Let me jump in. The margin reductions which are going to be supported with acquisition spend on marketing will be meaningful in our design just to narrow the gap that we talked about with the broader marketplace, and we're optimistic that those can actually improve our retail sales trends into the quarter. But they're big enough for us to talk about. And we're going to see how they roll out. We're going to see the impact within this quarter. And then when we have our year-end call in April, we'll provide insight and an outlook on what those margin reductions and marketing spend increase mean to us.

Jon Daniels
Senior Vice President

Yes. Sharon, this is Jon. I'll jump into your customer cohort question. Yes, I think there's obviously a places across the spectrum that we're looking to improve and grow sales. One in particular that stands out for me is if you look at maybe the higher FICO segments, we mentioned in the prepared remarks sort of in CAF and the Tier 2 section that maybe 650 to 750 space feels like we've lost volume there. We can track that through application volume coming through the door and then progression further on. So a lot of speculation around what that could be. Certainly, we're going to look at all things.

David mentioned a number of things pricing. Obviously, we try and keep our rates competitive. Just overall, the offering that we provide the consumer. But I think that's one spot in particular that I think there's a lot of chance to recapture and fuel our growth.

Sharon Zackfia
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Can I ask a follow-up? You have a competitor who will be kind of lowering finance rates proactively in the current quarter to reinvest some of the -- their GPU to the customer. I think historically, you followed the market on finance rates. Would there be something you're willing to do on interest rates to be -- to kind of weaponize that a bit more to get a more conversion?

Jon Daniels
Senior Vice President

Sure. I appreciate that question. Yes, I think we're always keeping the pulse on the markets, looking at how we compare to, obviously, credit unions and banks and what have you and certainly competitors as well. So the degree we can measure that. Yes, I'm not going to speak to what they're going to do. But we think our APRs are quite competitive with the Fed making the moves that they've had to make, we will adjust accordingly. We always have a test-and-learn methodology there. I'm not going to say we're going to try and get further ahead of the market. But I still think in maybe the space, there is a gap in interest rates that still exist, although it might be closing, but I think it's the broader offering question.

How do we compare from an interest rate standpoint, certainly, it may be term but obviously couple that with what's the price of the car and all the other fees associated with that. So I think the bigger offering picture is the one that's really going to be the focus here.

Enrique Mayor-Mora
Executive VP & CFO

And Sharon, what I'd say, looking at it a bit more broadly as well is that the reductions in SG&A. So these levers that we've talked about, the reductions in SG&A, the focus on COGS, growth opportunities and CAF full spectrum as well as EPP products that Jon talked about and we're happy to elaborate on. Those are all levers that bring to bear and ability to be more competitive in the marketplace. At the same time, we're reevaluating, as David talked about, reevaluating how we go to market, right?

And how we go to market, as Jon mentioned, it's the kind of cars, the price of the cars. It's how we communicate on our website. It's all those items. And so we do think we have levers at this point that are lining up to be materially more competitive and to go to market with.

Operator

Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist.

Scot Ciccarelli
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

So historically, I'm going to take another shot at this GPU question. Historically, I believe the management teams have talked about needing to lower prices by about $500 per unit to see a real inflection in the sales pace. So that would obviously be meaningful to use Enrique's words. So is that in the range of how you guys are thinking about reducing your GPU?

Enrique Mayor-Mora
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. What I'd say is I don't think we've said $500 is a meaningful or a needed amount to drive sales. We do price elasticity testing. We're always in the market doing price elasticity testing. I'd tell you the number to move sales is well south of that.

And in terms of what we're doing this quarter, look, we're trying different things. We are going out. It was again, sizable for us to talk about on this call. We're going to test the impact on sales, again, in combination with an increase in marketing to kind of get a boost there overall. And we're going to report out in the fourth quarter call in April and communicate what we saw in the market. We're optimistic it's going to change the trend in sales. But I wouldn't say that $500 is what we need to move sales, if that's what you're saying.

Scot Ciccarelli
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then just a follow-up, if I can. I guess it's a bigger picture question for Tom and David. What do you think CarMax represents to consumers today like in late 2025, given some of the alternatives that are out there? And where do you think you would like to end up in, call it, 2 to 3 years?

David McCreight
Interim President, CEO & Independent Director

Hey there, nice to talk to you, David here. We think many of the things that CarMax has meant to the customers in the past can continue to be. We believe we're a leading used car destination for customers. We've invested a lot of money and time and effort in building and broadening those capabilities to be able to let them shop where they want and how they want. And ultimately, we believe we're the most trusted brand out there. The difference is in where we've been and the performance we need to adjust to and adjust our model towards getting to and have confidence we're going to be able to get there in the near term.

Thomas Folliard
Executive Chairman

Scot, it's Tom. Good to talk to you again. From my perspective, and I'm a little biased. Over the last 30 years, we've built an iconic brand, and I don't think that's changed at all. I think the consumer knows what we represent. They know the quality that we represent. I think our associates in our stores and in our CECs and across the board are completely engaged and ready to serve the customer. We've spent a lot of money investing so that we could serve the customer however they want to be served, whether it's online or in our stores.

And I just think we need to activate that. We need to do a better job of presenting that to the customer upfront. But in terms of the brand and the strength and the quality of our vehicles, all that stuff is fully intact, and I think it's the basis for us moving forward and a basis from which we can grow again.

Operator

We will move next with Craig Kennison with Baird.

Craig Kennison
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

On the SG&A topic, what is the baseline SG&A from which you expect to cut $150 million? Just curious so that we can track your performance against that goal?

Enrique Mayor-Mora
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. No, absolutely. And so when we talked about our SG&A goal of $150 million reduction, it's a reduction of SG&A opportunities. That's really comparing it to last year, if you will. So if you want to use -- our base was $2.5 billion, right, roughly. And so that's what we're using as a baseline, and those are the reductions that we're going after.

Craig Kennison
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

And that is an exit run rate as of Q4 of fiscal '27?

Enrique Mayor-Mora
Executive VP & CFO

Exactly.

Our next question comes from Rajat Gupta with JPMorgan.

Rajat Gupta
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Thanks for the candid assessment on the prepared remarks. I had a follow-up on just the margin versus same-store expectation. Can you give us like any sort of quarterly read because we've got the sense that last quarter also, there was some effort to become more competitive. Anything you can give us in terms of like early reads in December and how those actions have already started to show some results? Or is it still very early? Or have you not implemented them yet? And what kind of like equation are we looking at in terms of dollar versus same-store volume trade-off, dollar GPU versus same for volume trade-off. Any more insights you can give us on how you see this equation playing out? And I have a very quick follow-up.

Enrique Mayor-Mora
Executive VP & CFO

Rajat. So we just rolled out the price changes. So it is too early to provide any kind of insight into that. And again, we will provide a view into that in our Q4 call, but we literally just rolled out those changes.

David McCreight
Interim President, CEO & Independent Director

They're underway.

Enrique Mayor-Mora
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, they're underway. Actually, they're not, that's a good point. They're not fully rolled out. They're underway, but we just started this week. So...

Rajat Gupta
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Is there hope to go back to share gains or positive unit growth and what kind of the expected outcome in the near term?

Enrique Mayor-Mora
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Look, like we are optimistic that this lever that we're pulling. And again, it's really the combination, right, of having lower margins, lower prices out there, being more price competitive, supporting it with acquisition marketing right? So think of like paid search, other direct levers like that, like directly to support sales is going to change the trend of our performance. So we just reported a negative 9% comp. Last quarter was a little better than that, but not great. And our goal is to change the trend and to get the sales flywheel going, and that's what we're looking to do.

And at the same time, we're working really hard on getting other profitability metrics or levers, I should say, in place. And again, those things are SG&A reductions, COG reductions, ETP growth, capital spectrum, so CAF income growth over time. These are all levers that we're pulling because our goal is to drive sales over time, absolutely, and to drive earnings power over time as well.

Rajat Gupta
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Understood. Just a quick follow-up on CAF. It looks like, as you mentioned, like third-party Tier 3 penetration went up. Is this -- is there anything like any meaningful like tightening effort going on right now? I'm curious how those reserves will change. going forward once you go back to having more in-house Tier 3, Tier 2 type penetration? Or maybe like any color you can give us on this CAF provisions in the fourth quarter would be helpful as well.

Jon Daniels
Senior Vice President

Sure. Yes, I appreciate the question, Rajat. Yes, I don't think there's a tremendous story in the Tier 2, Tier 3. We always just provide the numbers and provide a little guidance at the delta there. But there's always swapping between maybe a Tier 2 lender that is choosing to be a little more aggressive or doing tightening. Again, they're going to make their own individual decisions versus the Tier 3 partner that, again, may be the recipient of that tightening higher upstream again, being a little looser on their side. So I don't think there's a meaningful story there, just to clarify, just really providing the numbers.

And ultimately, to your second question, I don't think that -- I wouldn't read much into that in terms of CAF provision. Again, we are, as we stated, very, very excited about our opportunity as we go down into the Tier 2 spectrum, just for a point to note, this is -- we were over 10% of the Tier 2 volume came to CAF this quarter we went after. And so we're really excited about that.

And as we continue to go further spectrum, we're generally operating in that higher 50% of Tier 2 but we think we can get the entirety of that credit spectrum as we methodically roll out refinements to our model. We're excited about the funding solutions we have in place. And so we will reserve for it accordingly, and we will enjoy the income and we will get there.

Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.

Brian Nagel
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Tom, welcome back to the calls. Look, this is going to be a potentially repetitive -- I want to make -- get this point out. So we're talking about pricing and be more aggressive in pricing here. For as long as I can remember, I [indiscernible] come back for some time now when you've done these pricing tests. And the message from CarMax has always been the same is that they really lower prices, that the net result has not been favorable. So I guess the long asked is we're talking about, once again, either testing or moving forward with lower prices, I think, lower GPUs. What's different this time? Why do you think this will -- this time around going to differ than in the past, which is actually going to drive better unit volume.

Enrique Mayor-Mora
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I think in the past, look, when we've lowered our prices, and we do price elasticity all the time, right, Brian we talked about that. I think the equation in the past has been you lower your prices and then when you're flowing through to the business, do you make enough money to offset the lower margin with increased sales, it absolutely drives sales, right?

The equation as well, it didn't always drive enough profit. I think the difference, absolutely right now, there's a clear difference. The clear difference is that we have strong levers that are now supporting to look at the business more holistically.

So again, think of the reduction in SG&A that aggressive test that we're going after. You think of COGS and the -- how aggressive we're going after cons, you think of EPP growth, you think of CAF full spectrum income, these are all levers that are going to offset that pressure we had seen when we looked solely at the impact of lowering prices. So there's absolutely a difference. And we're just looking at the business a bit more holistically, and we have those levers at hand here.

David McCreight
Interim President, CEO & Independent Director

Yes. And Brian, I would just add that as Enrique mentioned, we've always talked about it in terms of total profitability. But when we do price changes, we definitely see some sales movement. And then we've always had kind of the guardrails around what total profitability is I would just tell you that our focus in the near term, given our current performance is to drive sales and to get things with in the other direction. The other thing to remember is when we say we're at lower prices of $100 or $200, it doesn't mean we're taking $100 across the board on cars. It's more like if we say $100, think of it as 10% of our cars are $1,000 or 5% of our car is $500. So it meaningfully impacts the trajectory of sales because of the way we execute price changes. But back to our near-term priority is to get things turned around and get sales moving in the other direction.

Brian Nagel
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

And then just a follow-up, sorry, David. But with regard to marketing, so you talked about, if I understand correctly, you stepped up marketing now, so to say, [indiscernible] on the gas, a little bit more. Is it -- when you think about it, is it more of the same? Or is CarMax really working on coming to market with a new marketing message?

David McCreight
Interim President, CEO & Independent Director

Yes, good question. Thank you. So what we're doing is taking -- the new campaign was launched recently as the team took you through. And what we're focusing on now in the near term is sort of optimizing the campaign we have with the results and tests we have. So shifting things that are going into driving more conversion, messaging, perhaps some of the -- and dialing back perhaps some of the brand longer-term spend on it. But ultimately, we think the review and positioning of the campaign is really something for the new CEO who's going to align it with the new strategy, and we're working with the existing campaign and resources we have right now. But the team has been working to optimize the results based on media, based on geographies and based on messaging.

Our next question comes from Daniela Haigian with Morgan Stanley.

Daniela Haigian
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

My first question is on that digital -- redefining the digital platform. what specifically within that needs to change to drive more of a selling experience? And how does that impact the operating cost structure with your store base? What would be early indicators of progress in that redefinition?

David McCreight
Interim President, CEO & Independent Director

Yes. So I'll take the first part of the question first. We have worked very diligently and over the years to build the capability set. But we have not been as focused yet on the next stage, which is to make it easier.

Look, shopping online with us is not easy. We have ways to streamline it, and we have ways to make the digital selling voice really, just like our sales associates in the stores, make it easier to bring to get them to the ultimate sale and the ultimate satisfaction is finding a car they like that they can afford. And we recognize that with all the good work that's been done, it's still not an easy experience. And so in our earnest efforts to provide information and countless options, we still have opportunity to streamline and bring it there.

And then in terms of the impact to downstream, we'll work in lockstep with the organization in the field. to figure out what those best options are, as both Jon mentioned and Enrique mentioned earlier, we have an opportunity to look holistically at our business model from our COGS, our SG&A, our messaging and all those components, and that includes how we make decisions, not necessarily individually, but more holistically and what that means for an offer for the customer. So we don't lose sight of what's most important to them. But I would expect you're going to see some of the changes. Tom and I would expect you'll see some of the changes. And it will be iterative in the next month or 2, you'll see it, and we'll continue after that. But you should see the efforts are underway and the team is very excited about this next step in that digital journey and how important it is in linking with the field team, very symbiotic.

Daniela Haigian
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And I appreciate your transparency there. My follow-up is on COGS, right? You and Enrique, you keep calling out COGS as a key lever. What's the strategy with reducing that line item? And are you still progressing towards that regional reconditioning center approach?

Enrique Mayor-Mora
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I would tell you, look, we have been focused on COGS for -- I mean, we're always focused on COGS, what we've done is, so we've called it out over the past couple of years. Like last year, we communicated a goal of $125 per unit. We hit that goal this year. We had communicated again another goal of $125 per unit.

I would tell you, given where sales have been for the past few quarters, we're probably a little bit behind that goal, not because the initiatives aren't there and the teams aren't doing great work is just because you delever in tough sales environment. But we will continue to put even more accelerated goals internally to go after COGS opportunities. Some of that is through the reconditioning centers, right?

Some of that -- I'll give you a real example. We just rolled out a parts selection tool in our stores. We're already seeing benefits from that, right, really kind of forcing our associates in the stores to take balance speed with quality, with cost and making it really easy for our associates to do that. and we're seeing results fairly immediately. And that's just an example of items we're focused on in COGS.

In terms of the reconditioning centers, yes, we've rolled out at this point in time, 5. Only 2 of them have been open for about a year. So it's still kind of early to tell what the goals are. I mean the ultimate goal is absolutely to get them more efficient. We're already seeing logistics savings in the system because we've rolled these things out and we expect that those will perform in line with some of our larger reconditioning units that we have in stores like Marietta in L.A. that we've seen there, highly efficient store because of the volume that we come through. We have the same expectations with these more regional reconditioning centers. But again, we've only rolled out a few at this point in time.

Our next question comes from David Bellinger with Mizuho Securities.

David Bellinger
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Tom, nice to talk to you again. In the prepared remarks, you guys mentioned reassessing the cost of bringing a car to market. What about the time to turn vehicles? Because CarMax has been a leader in that area for a long time. Looks like some competitors have increased their speed to market pretty dramatically. Is there anything you guys can do around AI implementation to cut down that time line, use your 30-plus years of data and potentially avoid some of those sharper depreciation swings that have disrupted the business over the last few quarters. How should we think about that opportunity?

Enrique Mayor-Mora
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think look, we're always focused on reconditioning, on speed, on lowering our WIP. For example, this quarter, we increased our sellable inventory and decreased our overall inventory, right? So that's really a strong focus on WIP that actually this quarter helped returns relative to last year despite comps being down 9%. So you can see the organizational focus on just getting better in terms of turning vehicles. I think our offsite reconditioning locations will help as well because it will be even more efficient. So just a couple of examples there in terms of the focus moving forward.

David Bellinger
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

And then Enrique, maybe a second question. Just can you update us on the real estate strategy? Anything that's changing there? You guys own a lot of your real estate. Is that a potential area where you can monetize and use that to fund more investment in the business if you need to?

Enrique Mayor-Mora
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Look, I think it always is a potential. We own a lot of our sites out there for our store locations. I tell you, we have better sources of capital versus doing like a sale leaseback or something. So we have great banking relationships, great partners out there, capital providers and we have a revolver, a $2 billion revolver, we can dip in there and just more efficient ways to get capital for us rather than kind of monetize our stores or the land under our stores.

Operator

Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with BNP Paribas.

Christopher Bottiglieri
BNP Paribas, Research Division

First one more clerical, I suppose, and just a bigger question. Did you give the service profit. I think it was $4 million last quarter. Just curious what that was for Q3? Is that a good run rate for Q4 given volumes are pretty similar in Q4 versus Q3? And then my actual -- can you just elaborate on what's happening with the credit penetration. It sounds like the prime side, I suppose, you're seeing less appraisal traffic or less traffic coming in? Is there -- I would think that with a K-shaped economy, that's probably the healthier side of the market? Just kind of curious what's causing that what you're seeing there.

Jon Daniels
Senior Vice President

Yes, that's fine. Chris, this is Jon. I'll take your -- the credit side. Yes, as we've noted in the remarks and even reflecting on Sharon's question, when we look across the credit spectrum, we really can gauge who's coming and shopping with us through our pre-qual product is a great place to do it. Customers love it, they take full advantage of it, 80-plus percent of our customers start with credit online. I think we see definitely an opportunity in that sort of 650 to 750 credit space. As I mentioned earlier, hard to speculate what's driving that is that we think our rates are quite competitive there. But it's always a question of inventory price availability, all of that.

I think as we mentioned on this call, holistically, all of that is up for discussion, and we're going to look at improving our overall offering there. So while you would say K-shaped economy, ultimately, we do see the other folks probably are less stressed by affordability. We want to make sure we have the right product at the right price at the right time for them when they're in to purchase. So I think there's improvement there. That's really what the comments, I think, are in that space are.

Enrique Mayor-Mora
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And regarding the service in the quarter, there definitely was pressure in services, as you know, and as we've talked about, it is a line item service margin that deleverages when sales are more challenged.

But look, like over the past couple of years, the teams have made material strides service margin over the past couple of years. And we had even talked at the beginning of this year that we expect it to be, I think, slightly positive for the year in service margins. Certainly, our sales expectations at that point in time. We're not where we are currently actualizing. But I'll tell you, for the full year, our outlook right now is maybe a little unprofitable or a little profitable depending on sales performance in the fourth quarter. And that just tells you the incredible work the teams are doing in for service margin there. But we did have a negative margin in the third quarter.

And we do expect, as I talked about in my prepared remarks, some pressure in the fourth quarter. We'll be comping over some cost coverage that we took last year. But again, if I take a step back and I look more holistically at it, the teams have done tremendous work. It's going to be borderline whether or not we hit the margin for the full year. But again, sales have been definitely more pressured than what we had anticipated versus the beginning of the year.

We will move next with John Babcock with Barclays.

John Babcock
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I guess just first of all, I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about what the Board is looking for in its next CEO and also how we should think about timing in terms of when something might be announced there, recognizing that might be variable.

Thomas Folliard
Executive Chairman

Yes. I would just tell you it's the Board's highest priority right now. It's my personal single highest priority as I'm leading the search along with the rest of the search committee. We're looking for somebody that has led a complex business with a diverse set of assets. We're hoping to find somebody that's also led some type of a digital transformation doesn't have to come from automotive necessarily. It doesn't necessarily have to come from retail. But one of the most important things is that somebody who understands our culture and can lead this team onto the next phase of our success. In terms of timing, we're moving as quickly as we can, but I don't really have an update on timing.

John Babcock
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Totally fair. And then next, at least based on the work that you've been doing over the last couple of months and even knowing the business. I was just wondering, how are you thinking about the omnichannel business? I mean do you think this is kind of a setup that you want to keep longer term? Do you think you want to shift more towards digital over time? What's the benefit of omnichannel versus digital or pursuing more of a brick-and-mortar strategy?

Thomas Folliard
Executive Chairman

I think for us, it's really -- it's all of the above. Over the last several years, as the team has been communicating, we've spent hundreds of millions of dollars in our infrastructure and giving us the capabilities to meet the customer wherever they want to be. I think having a national physical footprint is an advantage for us. Over 250 locations, as David mentioned in the beginning of the call, near 85% of the U.S. population.

So I think it's more of an all of the above strategy. I think some of the comments you've heard today is that we're not happy with how we present to the customer from a digital standpoint. And I think we're going to -- you'll see us make some significant improvements there. But we think our stores are extremely valuable and our store team is doing a great job meeting doing -- converting customers once we get them in the store. But we clearly need to get better on the digital side.

David McCreight
Interim President, CEO & Independent Director

Yes. And just to add a little color to Tom's comments on that. We, again, CarMax has built out so many capabilities. And now when we are talking about holistically looking at our business model, we've built out so many potential capabilities, and many of them are helpful, but some of them probably are adding clearly, decisions we've made, things we're trying to do and our best efforts to please everything for every customer. We have an opportunity to streamline, make some decisions, prioritize some things based on real quantified insight from the consumer in ways that we can streamline and optimize the advantages that omni should provide versus getting caught in some of the complexities that omni also provide.

So we think you'll see that in the near term as team sort of finishes that infrastructure buildout, but then get to really sharpen it and hone it into a competitive advantage.

Operator

We will move next with Jeff Lick with Stephens Inc.

Jeffrey Lick
Stephens Inc., Research Division

So listen, David, a question for you. You've been a senior leader at retail organizations that were digitally native and also retail organizations that are kind of a hybrid physical business and a digital business. I was wondering if you could speak to the challenges of CarMax as a hybrid business where there are people that are went into the physical part of the business and there's some natural tension, which makes it more difficult to have an ideal digital business.

David McCreight
Interim President, CEO & Independent Director

Yes, Jeff, great insight, and thank you for that question. Yes, there are examples of that. And that's a little bit of what I was alluding to.

Now I recognize Tom and I have been in the chair for 2.5 weeks or so. But what the most important things I see is that it's a really -- team is very excited about breaking through and it's an incredibly talented and dedicated group. We just need to work across those channels to make sure we're putting the customer at front of those decisions and not having the operational biases or legacy approaches come through. So there is not a battle between one version versus another. But what we need to do is provide some leadership and focus to the team so we can start executing more with that. what's most important to the customer, streamline, make sure it's a competitive offer because we know we own the brand, and we know we own the trust in a great part of the American consumer.

But you're absolutely right. Many organizations, omni causes them to trip up. I would say we're just going through finishing sort of like an awkward adolescence and we'll be moving into a much more refined effort in the coming time. Now that being said, you want to confirm that answer with the new CEO when they come in. But in the interim, we -- that's why we're so optimistic about the improvement because we have so many of the components already in place.

Jeffrey Lick
Stephens Inc., Research Division

And I was just wondering if we could quickly double back to Sharon's first question about potential cohorts that you might have lost or been be less effective with. I don't think she was thinking about necessarily the by FICO score. It kind of gets into the advertising strategy. And Tom, just wondering back in the day, it always seems like you over-indexed with that young professional likely a female that didn't want to go into the franchise dealer and to battle you provided a more easy professional experience. Do you think that your prime competitor has maybe cut you off at the past and has even done a better job of providing an experience for that person, where it's like, look, now it's super easy? Is that what...

Thomas Folliard
Executive Chairman

Your question about cohorts, the second quarter, we were down 6%. Last quarter, we were down 9%. So we need to improve across the board. I would just go back to the comments we've already made. We're not as easy as we need to be for the consumer. We need to simplify our processes. We need -- it's so easy to buy stuff online. It doesn't matter what it is these days. And it's true for automotive. It's not just true for 1 or 2 competitors, it's across the board. And again, we've invested the money to put ourselves in a position to be the best at this, and we've got some work to do to get there. But we need to simplify for the consumer, how they go through the process with us, whether it's on our website or in our app or in our stores.

We will move next with Chris Pierce with Needham.

Christopher Pierce
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Sort of following up on Jeff's thought there. I guess -- do you think you have the customer base that wants to do more of the work online to sort of drive an OpEx offset in GPUs? Or do you need to reposition the brand to get younger? Or would you sort of reject that framing?

Jon Daniels
Senior Vice President

Can you say that again, sorry?

Enrique Mayor-Mora
Executive VP & CFO

Sorry, we missed that.

Christopher Pierce
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Yes. I'm just curious, do you think you have the customer base that wants to do more of the work online? Like do you think you need to get younger with this new ad campaign? Or do you think it's just about pricing and the experience you're offering?

Thomas Folliard
Executive Chairman

I absolutely think we have the customer base that wants to do more of the process online. By the way, the younger you go, the less money you have and the less likely you are to have the credit required to buy a car that's $26,000. So -- but yes, I think we have plenty of customer flow and we need to take better advantage of it.

Enrique Mayor-Mora
Executive VP & CFO

And as David and Tom talked about, look, we have enviable assets, right? We have an awareness level that's off the charts. We have consumers that are extremely loyal and that love our brand. We have associates that are outstanding. We have more than 250 stores across the country that operate extremely well. We have a strong -- we've invested in the digital capabilities. We just need to kind of fine-tune how those things mesh together.

But in terms of whether or not we have customers out there that want to buy us, I would tell you, absolutely, that's not the concern that we have the opportunity that we have is to make our offering based on the consumer, the most compelling that we can make it, and that's what we're focused on.

We will move next with Michael Montani with Evercore.

Michael Montani
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Just wanted to dig into, I guess, it's a 3 parter, but it's kind of all related, which was depreciation trends, just some incremental color about what you're seeing in the competitive backdrop is the intensity ratcheting up? And then lastly was on the reinvestment into GPU. Just how much of a reinvestment we ought to be thinking about moving ahead?

Enrique Mayor-Mora
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. For depreciation, my comments were really in the wholesale area, right? We did see very sharp depreciation within the quarter, a greater than 10% depreciation within the quarter, so very sharp and that impacted performance within the quarter as that abates, then we would expect that performance would have been run.

In terms of GPU, we did talk about that. Look, it's material in that for us to talk about it on the call. But at the same time, we've just rolled out different levels of pricing changes, we're going to see kind of how it performs within the quarter. And then in our Q4 call, we'll come back and we'll talk about what we saw and also what that means for our plan moving forward. I say that, but we're also optimistic that it's going to change the sales trend that we've had either negative 6%, negative 9% comps sequentially, and that's what we're looking to change. We're looking to change that trend. And we'll come back with that. I forget your number 2 question, but then...

Michael Montani
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Just the competitive intensity.

Thomas Folliard
Executive Chairman

Let me add to the pricing part, which is our pricing is not -- it's not like we have a static pricing model where we just lower all of our prices and leave them there. This is going to be very dynamic throughout the quarter. I think one of the things David and I and the rest of the team here assessed in a short period of time is if you want to get things moving in the other direction, there's some significant levers that you can push, but the 2 biggest are clearly pricing and marketing.

So we're making moves there to try to get the trend moving in the other direction, but it will be very dynamic throughout the quarter. It's why -- we're not trying to be evasive with what we think the margin impact will be, but we're trying to be as impactful as we can. And again, we're 18 days into the quarter. So this will be a dynamic process throughout the next 3 months.

We don't have any further questions at this time. I will hand the call back to David for any closing remarks.

David McCreight
Interim President, CEO & Independent Director

Thank you. We'd like to thank the thousands of CarMax associates who helped build the business that we have today and will be part of our next leg of growth in the future. Thank you all for joining our call today. And then before we sign off, Tom has some closing remarks.

Thomas Folliard
Executive Chairman

Yes. I just thank all of you guys for your support. Many of you I know and have heard your voice in the past. And although it's good to be back, I wish it was under slightly different circumstances. But what I would tell you is from the Board perspective, we are absolutely committed to getting this right. David is the perfect person to sit in this role while we search for our next CEO. I'm happy to spend more time on the business.

What I've been most enthusiastic about over the last 2 weeks is how engaged all of our employees are and how excited they are to win. And as we've mentioned multiple times and Enrique just kind of covered in total, we have incredible assets in this company. We have a great balance sheet. We have an iconic brand. We have 250 locations. And most importantly, what has always separated us from everybody else is the engagement of our more than 28,000 associates. And none of that has wavered.

So I just wanted to close by saying the Board is absolutely committed to getting this right. And I wanted to also thank David for the role that he is playing while we're in the middle of this search. And lastly, I wish everybody a happy holiday season. Thank you for joining us, and we'll talk to you next time.
