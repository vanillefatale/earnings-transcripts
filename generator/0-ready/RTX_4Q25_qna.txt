[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of Peter Arment from Baird.

Peter Arment
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Nice results and congrats on all the momentum in the business, Chris.

Christopher Calio
Chairman & CEO

Thank you.

Peter Arment
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes, so many topics here to talk about in '26, but I guess I'd want to start with the GTF fleet management plan. It's year 3 here in your financial and technical outlook has remained on track the entire time. Maybe can you give us the latest kind of update and any key items we should expect going forward with the plan.

Christopher Calio
Chairman & CEO

Yes, you got it, Peter. And you're right, Peter, right, I always start this way. Our financial technical outlook remain on track and consistent with our prior comments. AOG did come down in Q4, and they're down over 20% from the highs of 2025. So making good progress there. As I said before, MRO output remains the key enabler and that continues to improve. The 1,100 output, as we said upfront, was up 26% last year and that was with heavier shop visits increasing 40% year-over-year. So really good improvement in the shops.

And importantly, we exited the year on a strong note. Output was up 39% in the fourth quarter, which included a 16% reduction in turnaround time and a significant increase in repair volume, which, as you know, takes some pressure off of the need for new material. So all in, this positions us pretty well to grow MRO output at a similar level in '26, which in turn enables us to continue to reduce AOG throughout the year, continues to be our top priority, making sure we get the fleet in a better condition, and we're making progress there.

The next question will come from the line of Ronald Epstein from Bank of America.

Ronald Epstein
BofA Securities, Research Division

Kind of like Peter alluded to, it's sort of like everything everywhere all at once so far this year, and we're only a couple weeks in. Maybe broadly, Chris, how are you thinking about -- I mean, we got this executive order about how defense companies deploy capital. RTX was highlighted in a social media post by the administration. How are you broadly thinking about that? And what's it mean to you as a manager of the business? How do you handle all that?

Christopher Calio
Chairman & CEO

Yes, thanks for the question, Ron. Let me break it down maybe in a couple parts here. Number one, we understand that our products are critical to national security and security of our partners and allies. And I can tell you, across the organization, we absolutely feel the responsibility and urgency to deliver more and to deliver it faster. And candidly, we understand the frustration. And I can tell you, our focus and resources are fully aligned with the department's mandate to ramp production and invest in capacity. And as we said upfront, we made some progress in 2025. I think some very good progress. Output was over -- up over 20% on a number of the critical programs, but there's more to do. We expect to significantly increase output again this year, and we're also going to increase our CapEx to enable that ramp.

As it relates to capital allocation, again, we recognize our shareholders rely on our dividends, and they've come to expect our dividends. We've been paying them for decades on a quarterly basis, so we remain committed to the dividend. That said, again, we're comfortable we can accommodate both that and the investment needs that come with delivering the current backlog and the potential future volumes on key programs. And I can tell you that we continue to have active and constructive engagement with the department on its future needs and how we can fulfill those and strengthening the industrial base. So we've got to do it all.

Operator

The next question will come from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley.

Kristine Liwag
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Maybe, Chris, Neil, RTX is now the largest aerospace defense company in the world by sales. And we're living in a very dynamic period, seeing unprecedented demand for your products but also, unique actions from the government where they're willing to invest in supporting CapEx. I guess like how are you thinking about the portfolio composition and potential monetization for shareholders given the recent move from one of your competitors where they're carving out a mission solutions business, receiving a $1 billion investment from the government with an IPO in the second half of the year. How do you think about your portfolio? And where do you see the opportunities?

Christopher Calio
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Kristine. I'll start. Again, I continue to believe -- we continue to believe and have strong conviction that RTX is constructed to meet the moment. By the moment, I mean the ramp both in defense and commercial and to drive long-term value for customers and shareholders. Now I've said this before, our breadth and scale provides a competitive advantage in our mind in terms of technology, cost structure, customer and market knowledge and talent. And as you know, in this industry, you make big bets on large platforms and that requires a strong balance sheet, an ability to innovate and invest over the long term and the ability to manufacture at scale for a sustained period of time, all things that are within the RTX core competency.

And you're also starting to see this convergence of commercial and defense tech, you're seeing a lot of that given the transformation initiatives that the Department of War is pushing forward. And I think we're just uniquely positioned to compete in that environment. And I think that provides us a real opportunity as opposed to perhaps some of our competitors. And as we said before, we're going to continue to invest, and we've got the balance sheet to continue to invest in the capacity and in technology to meet both the current backlog and the programs of the future.

The next question will come from the line of Robert Stallard from Vertical Research.

Robert Stallard
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Probably a question for Neil regarding the 2026 guidance. Your forecast for Pratt & Whitney, particularly on the OEM side, looks a bit conservative, particularly given what Airbus is planning on the A320 and A220 going forward here. So I was wondering if you could perhaps delve into the components a bit more particularly on aerospace OEM.

Neil Mitchill
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Rob. I appreciate the question. Let me give you a little bit of color. I think it's important to kind of see what's underneath the covers there on the Pratt side. I would start by saying in 2025, we had our large commercial engine deliveries up 6%, as Nathan said. As we think about 2026, I think the large commercial engine output in terms of deliveries is likely to be up, call it, mid- to high single digits. So it's growing on top of the number that we put up for 2025. We've talked at length for a number of years about the mix in the OE and balancing the need to support the flying fleet today as well as installs at Airbus. And we think we put together a plan that does just that. And so we will see continued growth on the MRO side at Pratt that will support the GTF aircraft in particular, and the rest will go between Airbus and spares.

I think if we look inside of the install side, we still see growth on both the installs and probably flattish on the spare engine deliveries for 2026. So a little mix headwind on the top line, but in terms of output, strong output throughout the course of this year. If it's better, you'll see that, but we're really trying to make the right balancing decisions between MRO and install. And Chris has a couple of other things...

Christopher Calio
Chairman & CEO

Yes. No, I'd just add a couple other notes here. Again, our 2025 total deliveries were up over 50% versus 2019 levels. I think that's important to continue to reinforce. And as Neil said, we're always going to try to support our customers. There's a balance that we've got to bring to bear given what's going on with the fleet. But the backlog on the program is very strong. And we've got key investments coming online over the next 24 months to continue to support it, a new powder metal tower, new forging press, some additional capacity in Asheville, where we do turbine airfoils. So we're 100% in support of continuing to drive deliveries on the program over the long term because the backlog is there, and the customer demand is there.

Operator

The next question will come from the line of Scott Deuschle from Deutsche Bank.

Scott Deuschle
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Neil, why does Pratt commercial aftermarket growth slow to high single digits in 2026, particularly given the strength you saw here in the fourth quarter and then the commentary on GTF MRO volumes? And then for Chris, I was wondering if you might give us an update on when you expect castings output to begin to ramp up at Asheville.

Neil Mitchill
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Scott. I will start with the Pratt. I'll fill in where I left off. We were talking about the OE side. About 70% of Pratt's growth in '26 is going to come from commercial aftermarket. We talked about that being up high single digits. If you kind of look at the pieces here, I'll start with Pratt Canada. We'll see growth in their aftermarket. That's in the high single-digit range. So very solid there, growing ahead of RPKs in the market. Within the large commercial engine business, on a V2500 shop visit basis, we talked last year about doing 800 or so shop visits. We probably did a little bit more than that. I think for 2026, we're expecting it to be more or less the same probably within 20 shop visits of 2025, so steady and above 800.

There's a little bit of an offset on the PW4000s and 2000s as those older engines start to retire. Those are expensive overhauls, and we're seeing a little bit of headwind there, probably about $100 million for 2026, all things that we saw coming and we planned aligned with our customers' fleet plan. So inside of the aftermarket, those are a couple of moving pieces on the legacy side of the business. And of course, the GTF aftermarket is continuing to grow, as you point out. Chris talked about stepping up again similar to the growth level that we saw in 2025.

The shop visit content varies, though they're getting heavier. And so we will see that in the top line. Maybe just a comment on the profitability there. We've seen solid margins, in progression on the GTF aftermarket. I'd call it, low double-digit kind of margins. See 1 to 2 points maybe of expansion here in '26. So that GTF aftermarket revenue stream is moving in the right direction as we get further away from entry into service and start to put in new contracts and gain durability improvements that we've talked about and the pricing in the contract structures.

Christopher Calio
Chairman & CEO

Yes. And Scott, maybe on the second part of your question on the casting piece. So the casting foundry investment has been approved. We moved out on that investment. We're in that sort of buildup phase and working to make sure the yields are where we need them so that when we're going into production, we're getting the yields that we need. And I think that impact we'll start to feel that more in the '28, '29 time frame.

Operator

The next question will come from the line of Myles Walton from Wolfe Research.

Myles Walton
Wolfe Research, LLC

This might be for Neil. So Neil, could you pull back the covers on the Raytheon segment in terms of the growth rates of maybe some of the larger SBUs? I heard the comment about the 20% growth in some of the effectors, but maybe just a little bit of color there. And then, Chris, following the comments by the administration, have you engaged to change any behavior? And if so, what is it that they're requesting?

Neil Mitchill
Executive VP & CFO

Great. Thanks, Myles. I'll start here. As I pointed out in our opening comments here, the majority of that sales increase is coming from the land and air defense systems business. I'd say over half of it, frankly. Obviously, that's supported by material growth. We've seen 11 consecutive quarters of growth. We're expecting mid- to high single-digit growth in material again here in '26. That's the heart of the Raytheon business, obviously on the munitions and the sensors. So that's where the bulk of it's coming from, supporting programs that you all know about, Patriot, GEM-T, LTAMDS, et cetera.

I think importantly, for Raytheon, about 85% of our '26 sales are sitting in our backlog today. So feeling very confident in the outlook that we put out today for them. And as I think about the rest of the year, we should be able to fill that remaining 15% nicely. And it's all about coordinating the supply chain and getting things synchronized, which we're seeing continued improvement in over the last 12 to 18 months. Chris?

Christopher Calio
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So Myles, I would say that we're obviously fully supportive of the transformation initiatives that the department is pushing forward. And we are working in partnership with them on ways to move output faster and to accelerate, whether that be through different requirements or testing protocols or anything within our shop that can make things more efficient in partnership with the customer.

We're also talking to them about how do we get the most out of our existing capacity, what suppliers do we need help with, whether that be from a throughput perspective or an investment perspective. And then again, where do we need to invest in capacity as we see the demand continuing to ramp. So it's a partnership on a number of fronts. It's been very constructive and collaborative. And we're going to, I hope, start to see the benefit of that here in '26 as we've got to continue to ramp on some critical programs.

Operator

The next question will come from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan.

Seth Seifman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Wanted to ask another one about defense and maybe a slightly different topic. But in terms of missile defense and the Golden Dome initiative, we understand that the administration is looking for contractors to step out a little bit more there in terms of fronting our R&D to be involved in that effort, particularly with space-based interceptors. And wondering how you're thinking about that given both Raytheon's traditional capabilities in missile defense, but also a pretty full plate in terms of ramping up some of the existing programs.

Christopher Calio
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Seth. Overall, we're looking at Golden Dome as a real opportunity for us. You just step back and look at what we continue to believe is the multilayered architecture. We believe we've got solutions at each of those layers. And you know those systems very well, whether it be Patriot, whether it be GEM-T, SPY-6, Coyote and the like. So between effectors and sensors, have a full suite of products that we think can meet the needs of Golden Dome. I think there are also some opportunities in space. Can't talk about them too much. But again, I think we've got some unique capabilities there that we're discussing with the department.

And as with all things, we're always looking at the opportunities for us to increase capacity for some of this demand. As you know, there are long lead time items in some of these areas. There are suppliers that we need to continue to sort of rejuvenate and make sure that they can meet the demands that we need. So all of those things are going on, identifying a long lead material we might need, everything that will help us accelerate production. So when those awards come down, we're ready.

Neil Mitchill
Executive VP & CFO

Seth, I would just add that with respect to the investment and our willingness to invest, we, of course, would invest in good business. And so we're prepared to make the right choices there. Our R&D for 2026 is going to approach $3 billion with a healthy portion of that sitting in Raytheon, obviously. So we're prepared to make those investments when it makes sense to do so.

Operator

The next question will come from the line of John Godyn from Citi.

John Godyn
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

All the businesses are experiencing tailwinds and it's been quite a good run for the last few quarters. I know it can be hard to pick your favorite child, but I was hoping you could just help us sensitize the outlook a bit in the context of the segments. Which one do you think has the most scope for exceeding guidance based on the demand signals that you're seeing recently?

Neil Mitchill
Executive VP & CFO

So I'm going to give this one to Chris. Actually, I'll answer it, John. It's obviously early in the year, and we love all of our children here at RTX. So I think all 3 businesses have tailwinds behind them, frankly. I think it's early in the year. We set our guide based on where our backlog sits today. We've got a number of initiatives that are obviously in the pipeline here in terms of cost reduction. So when I think about Collins in particular, they've kicked off a pretty significant transformation effort there to drive cost out of both the production side as well as the back office. So I see tailwinds supporting the Collins margin trajectory.

If I go to Raytheon, we've talked a lot about it already this morning, the defense business, the demand, the productivity improvements that we're seeing in Raytheon, we've seen about $160 million year-over-year improvement for each of the last 2 years. Now that may tail off a little bit. We'll see probably another $25-or-so million of year-over-year improvement. But we're in the zone where we're seeing positive productivity coming out of the Raytheon business. And that's because of the significant volume, the synchronization with the supply chain and the continued execution mode that we're in there. So that's how I kind of think about the Raytheon business.

And over at Pratt, obviously there's a ways to go there, but we know that the GTF program is growing significantly. We're performing well. We're growing out of the older contracts. we're getting pricing and the legacy businesses continue to be intact there, and we see that staying steady for the next several years. So great businesses, hard to pick one. But clearly, all of them have margin potential over the next several years, and that's what we're focused on.

And I think if we execute and deliver the backlog we have today, that we'll naturally see that margin expansion over the next couple of years. Importantly, that will convert to cash. And you're seeing that in the '26 outlook, we saw it as we exited '25 exceeding where we had thought we would exit the year on strong collections. So really good position to be in. And again, it affords us the opportunity to take on that extra investment to build for the future capacity that's not even yet sitting in our backlog. Chris?

Christopher Calio
Chairman & CEO

I think you said it really well, Neil. And the only thing that I would emphasize, John, is that each of the businesses is fully focused on getting to its full potential. I will tell you that Neil outlined some time frames for each of those. Some are closer, as you might imagine, but all dedicated to driving operational improvement through core structural cost reduction and a maniacal focus on execution given the backlog.

Operator

The next question will come from the line of Gautam Khanna from TD Cowen.

Gautam Khanna
TD Cowen, Research Division

I had 2 quick ones. One, a follow-up to the prior question, just on Raytheon Defense, productivity, and you also have higher volumes and better mix over time with the foreign backlog conversion into sales. So what's your updated thoughts on eventual margin entitlement for that segment? And then want to just ask on GTF, could you remind us again in the guidance for '26 what the cash customer compensation payments are and if there's going to be any tail to that in 2027? And if you could just give us the final number for 2025.

Neil Mitchill
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Gautam. Let me start with the last question. So in our outlook for 2026, we have $700 million place held as the cash outflow. We exited 2025 with $1 billion. So cumulatively, we're at $2.8 billion when you get through the end of 2026. We had talked about that being about a $3 billion cash headwind to us over the period of time we execute the FMP. So that leaves a couple hundred million dollars. As I sit here today, we've been very prudent in our management of the compensation. We've got agreements with customers and very, very disciplined there. So that's how I see it today in good shape for the 2026.

As it relates to the Raytheon margin potential, we're exiting 2025 strong. Our outlook for 2026 puts us pretty close to the 12% range that we talked about. And as you pointed out, the international mix is increasing. Today, our backlog has about 47% international mix in it, and we expect the sales mix to grow. I will say, as we talk about increasing our capacity for munitions and sensors that will have a different sort of mix impact as well. But there's no reason to believe that the Raytheon margins can't be north of 12%, and we're certainly well on our way in this outlook that we put out today.

Christopher Calio
Chairman & CEO

The other piece of tailwind that I would add there to Neil's comments is if you just look at the backlog composition. Neil talked about the international component. But if you just -- if you think about the products that are continuing to grow in that backlog, those are products in our core competency, mature products that are going to continue to help drive productivity and improve margins. And when you think about where some of this future demand is as part of this defense transformation, whether it be the effectors, Golden Dome, again, these are going to be the products in integrated air and missile defense that are core to Raytheon.

Operator

The next question will come from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.

Sheila Kahyaoglu
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I wanted to ask about Collins because I feel like it's a bit forgotten given everything else going on. Collins embeds 70 basis points of margin expansion, 40 basis points of that is the divestiture benefit, so only 30 bps organically. But it seems like there's a lot of good things going on in this segment, whether it's double-digit OE narrow body growth, which I presume is in line with segment margins, 10% aftermarket productivity plan in place. Maybe if you guys could bridge us, and obviously a full year of tariffs is maybe some of that offset.

Neil Mitchill
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Sheila, for the question. So let me start with '25. You're right, we had about 30 basis points of margin expansion there. I would tell you that from a tariff perspective, that was a 90 basis point drag. So if you were to add that back, we saw Collins, I'll call it, organic margins at 17.1%, which was really, really nice to see. Obviously, we're still living with the tariff situation. We do expect to see a bit of a tailwind as we move from 2025 to 2026 on tariffs, probably about $75 million lower. And keep in mind, we're picking up an extra quarter of tariff expense in 2026. So the first quarter will be a little bit depressed on the Collins margins as they pick up an extra quarter. But nonetheless, still seeing really good margin expansion there.

As you go to 2026, inclusive of tariffs, we're going to see another 80 basis points of margin expansion at the midpoint. As I said, a couple minutes ago, Collins has a ton of effort going into digitizing the back office, streamlining their footprint, and we're seeing the benefits of that cost reduction activity already come through in these margins. And I think that there are several years of benefits ahead of us as a result of the work they're doing. So we are seeing that improved drop-through.

Obviously, in '26, we've got OE growing about 10%. Those margins are probably consistent with what you'd expect for sort of a defense kind of margin, low double digits and some really robust aftermarket, about 45% of their growth coming from the aftermarket business with the kind of drop-through that you'd expect in the business at Collins. So well positioned, growing installed base, RPKs are strong, and we're getting the pricing benefit, too, that we've been pushing for in light of these headwinds we've been dealing with over the last couple of years.

Operator

The next question will come from the line of Douglas Harned from Bernstein.

Douglas Harned
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

When you look at the GTF right now, when you talked about how AOGs are coming down off that peak, the other thing going on at Pratt is, as you talked about, you've got increasing work scope on V2500s, which is very good for margin. You've had -- you're getting life extensions. But how should we think about the longer-term margin at Pratt? Because on one hand you have that benefit, but as AOG start coming back, you may have 2 other effects, which are you may see some PW1100-powered airplanes lead to parking of some fees and you're going to have some decline in spare engine ratio. So how should we think about combining all of those things for the long-term Pratt margin?

Christopher Calio
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I'll start, Doug, and Neil, feel free to chime in. You're right on a number of those tailwind components, Doug. The V2500 is going to continue to be strong. Shop visits are going to stay in that 800 range and the content is going to continue to be strong. We see low retirements there, a lot of continued demand for that platform. When you think about the margin trajectory at Pratt, obviously there's going to be some headwind associated with continued OE deliveries. You know that -- with that margin profile sort of looks like there. But we're also continuing to grow the GTF in the installed base. And so a big part of this is going to be continuing to drive GTF aftermarket margins. And so how do we go and do that?

Well, number one, you know we've put in place a number of durability improvements. A number started going in last year, and you can start to see that benefit throughout the fleet. You've got the GTF advantage that's going to be coming into play. We got the EU engine certification in Q4, expect the aircraft certification relatively soon. We started producing that engine and that production cutover and expect EIS on that later in the year.

And then the third piece, and it's related to the GTF advantage, is that we're also anticipating the incorporation of our Hot Section Plus retrofit package into MRO later this year. That's 90% to 95% of the durability benefits of the GTFA and that's going to be going into the installed base today as part of that retrofit package. So it's going to be the GTF aftermarket that's going to need to continue to grow in profitability. That'll take the margins up at Pratt.

Neil Mitchill
Executive VP & CFO

And maybe just to add a couple points, Doug. I think with respect to the size of the fleet, today's GTF fleet is about the same size. In fact, I think it's a little bit larger than the installed flying V2500 fleet. So sort of to compensate for what will ultimately be retirements, as you look out a number of years, that GTF fleet is just growing at a really significant rate. And so that will overcome sort of lost revenues and profits that we'll see on the V2500 as it retires.

As it relates to the spare engines, I mean, you talk about the ratio. I think another way to think about that might be there's just going to be continued demand for spare engines. So again, as that fleet gets bigger, while the ratio might come down, we'll still be selling a lot of spare engines, and I expect that to be a continued steady stream of revenue and profits. And what we like about that, of course, is it helps the fleet, which helps the aftermarket contracts, but it also generates its own aftermarket because those engines will ultimately come in for overhauls as well. So that's how I would frame a couple of the data points behind what Chris said.

Operator

The next question will come from the line of Scott Mikus from Melius Research.

Scott Mikus
Melius Research LLC

Chris and Neil, very nice results and solid guide. I wanted to touch on Ron's and Myles' question. This administration seems more willing to allow M&A deals to go through. They also want defense companies to invest ahead of contract awards and expand capacity. But I've always just thought that the primes get somewhat unfairly blamed because a lot of the bottlenecks to higher production actually lie deeper in the supply chain. So does it make sense from a capital deployment perspective to pursue vertical integration at Raytheon, whether it's organic or inorganic?

Christopher Calio
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks for the question, Scott. And again, when we talk to the department, I will tell you that we are -- our supply chain. They pay us to manage our suppliers and deliver, whether it be an all up round or a full system or whatnot. So again, we've been working in partnership with them. And how do we continue to strengthen the industrial base? Because to take production to the levels that the department needs, you're just going to need to continue to invest in that industrial base and bring new suppliers into the fold. And that's where I think I'd sort of direct your second part of your question. I don't necessarily think it's about vertical integration. I think about strengthening what we have today and bringing new sources into the industrial base.

You've seen there's been a number of activities and investments on solid rocket motors, for instance, because that has continued to be a bottleneck for the industry writ large. We continue to look for other casting suppliers because that affects not only what's going on in commercial, but defense as well. So I think it's really about infusing more capital into the supply base, strengthening that supply base, and then finding new suppliers in some of the constrained value streams.

Operator

And the last question will come from the line of Matt Akers from BNP Paribas.

Matthew Akers
BNP Paribas, Research Division

Most of mine have been answered, but just want to ask about debt maturities. A fair amount coming due this year. Just curious what your plans are to address those.

Neil Mitchill
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Matt. Appreciate the question. We've talked for a couple of years now about our debt repayment priorities. We made a payment of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, and we've got about $3.4 billion of payments that are coming due this year that we anticipate to make and bring that debt down further. So that's what I would say today about our plans for paying down the debt that's on the balance sheet. We're making great progress. As Chris said, balance sheet's really strong and positions us well for continuing to make the investments that we've talked at length about today.

Operator
