James Jenkins
President, CEO & Executive Chairman

Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss the results of our fiscal 2026 3rd quarter ended October 31, 2025.

We continued revenue momentum in the third quarter of 2026 despite a challenging tariff and macroeconomic environment as we focused on recent acquisition synergies, increasing our market share within the fragmented $2 billion fire protection sector in the largest global markets and growing our industrial products business. Calven will go over the financials in more detail shortly, so I'll provide you with a brief overview.

We achieved net sales of $47.6 million, representing a 4% year-over-year increase, driven by a 31% increase in fire services products. In the U.S., our sales increased 25% year-over-year to $15.2 million. We continue to anticipate growth in our fire services, both organically and through our acquisitions, as well as in our industrial segments in the months and years ahead.

Adjusted EBITDA, excluding FX, was $200,000, a decrease of $4.5 million were 95% compared with $4.7 million for the comparable year ago period. Sequentially, our adjusted EBITDA decreased $4.8 million or 96%. Adjusted gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter was 31.3% versus 41.7% in the comparable year ago period and decreased 612 basis points sequentially from 37.4% in the second quarter.

Our adjusted gross margin percentage decreased in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower acquired company gross margins, increased material and freight costs and tariffs. Margins in the acquired businesses were impacted by increased material costs. This shortfall is meaningful, and it's important to emphasize that the EBITDA impact this quarter was driven by both revenue and gross margin shortfalls. The 2 are inseparable.

The revenue misses directly reduced gross profit dollars, removing the operating leverage we depend on to convert volume into earnings. Even if margins had held the lower revenue base would have pressured EBITDA. Conversely, the margin compression amplified the effect. EBITDA underperformance reflects the combined impact of lower volume and reduced margin per dollar of revenue, not margin deterioration alone.

SG&A remained disciplined and broadly in line with expectations. The quarter broke on revenue and gross profit dollars, not on expense growth. Several factors contributed to the margin compression. Freight in and tariffs ran above forecast. Through throughput and mix in efficiencies affected COGS, labor and our mix shifted from higher-margin categories.

Moving on, the strategic acquisitions of California PPE and Arizona PPE expanded our global fire footprint into the U.S. personal protective equipment, decontamination, repair and rental markets and added approximately $5 million of annual recurring revenue. Arizona PPE is the leading UL-certified independent service provider for performing advanced decontamination, inspection and repairs on fire finance for the Arizona market. California PPE is a leading and rapidly expanding UL-certified ISP in the California firefighting services market, one of the largest fire markets in the United States.

From these 2 outstanding companies, we intend to continue growing the North American service segment of the global fire services market by leveraging the combined strengths and experience of Lakeland's LHD service offerings in Asia and Australia with the outstanding teams from Arizona PPE and California PPE to develop a strong North American platform.

Lakeland LHD was awarded an approximately USD 5.6 million 3-year contract to provide advanced decontamination, managed care and maintenance services for the Hong Kong fire services departments, firefighter protective gear, one of the largest emergency response organizations in Asia. A contract running through 2028 covers advanced decontamination services as well as comprehensive care and maintenance of an estimated 14,500 firefighter ensembles each year. This award underscores our strong presence in the Asia Pacific market and reinforces the trust placed in our services by one of the region's most respected fire services organizations.

Additionally, we completed a $6.1 million sale and partial leaseback of our Decatur, Alabama warehouse property to an unrelated party in connection with capital reallocation initiatives, resulting in a gain of $4.3 million, as well as strengthening the balance sheet and providing financial flexibility for future growth.

The third quarter reflected the impact of tariff uncertainty, inflation effects and the associated mitigation strategies we have employed since the election. Beyond tariffs, we also faced raw material inflation and rising supply chain costs that also contributed to the impact on both revenue and gross margin. Revenue softness was visible across our portfolio in the U.S., Canada, Latin America and parts of EMEA. North America faced challenges with revenue down quarter-over-quarter, and Latin America came in below our plan due to macroeconomic conditions impacted by political uncertainty.

Our acquired businesses also came in below our plan due to timing, certification delays and material flow issues rather than underlying demand. As we step back, it's important to acknowledge that this softness is not isolated to Lakeland, nearly all of our peers are reporting similar challenges: tariffs, freight, raw material inflation and rising supply chain costs. This is not an excuse, but it is the reality of the environment we are operating in, and it reinforces that the pressure on margins is broad-based, not to us. At the end of Q3, inventory was $87.9 million, down from $90.2 million at the end of Q2 fiscal year 2026. We have recently initiated a series of targeted actions to optimize inventory levels across our entire organization.

Looking ahead, we are highly focused on the upcoming tender cycle, which will position us for stronger execution and building momentum heading into calendar year 2026. Renewed tender activity is expected to increase demand for fire services in the U.S. and internationally and contribute to improved performance at Eagle and LHD Germany. We have approximately $178 million of global tender opportunities, including $38 million over $100,000 in value with high probabilities of success. These opportunities are positioning us for expanded operating leverage with expense reductions and expanded margins as tenders deliver margins above normalized profile. We are now starting to see tender wins for calendar 2026 across our entire product portfolio.

Taken together, this past quarter was unacceptable. We missed our targets across multiple areas. And as CEO, I take full responsibility for that performance. Our forecasting has not been reliable and the gap between our internal expectations and actual results has grown too large. Because of this, we will be withdrawing formal guidance. Instead, we are shifting to a more disciplined operating model focused on measurable execution, cash generation and transparency.

To help lead us forward, we have also realigned our finance team with the appointment of Calven Swinea as interim CFO effective January 1. You'll be hearing from Calven in a moment. At the same time, it is important to recognize that this quarter occurred against a backdrop of unprecedented headwinds across virtually all of our global operations. These challenges affected not just Lakeland but our peers as well, many of whom have publicly acknowledged similar pressures. Despite this environment, our long-term fundamentals remain intact and our strategic condition has not changed.

We remain extremely optimistic about the underlying demand signals we are seeing a robust and global fire tender pipeline. The necessary U.S. refinery shutdown cycle ahead. Our disciplined sales process and clear signs of pent-up demand across nearly every region. We expect these headwinds to begin to ease as we move into calendar year 2026, and we continue to believe strongly in the long-term potential of both our fire and industrial strategies.

This is not about lowering ambition. It's about rebuilding trust results or projections. We will provide regular updates on key operational milestones, inventory reduction progress, margin improvements and ERP and integration time lines. When our forecasting accuracy, sales cadence and operational visibility improve to an acceptable standard, we will revisit reinstating guidance. For now, our full focus is on running the core business with rigor, improving forecast accuracy and delivering sustainable, predictable performance.

With that, I'd like to pass the call to Barry to provide an update on fire services.

Barry Phillips
Chief Revenue Officer - Fire

Thank you, Jim. Looking at our fire services. Revenue underperformed primarily because certification cycles and tender time lines extended longer than anticipated across multiple regions. These are timing delays rather than structural demand issues. The opportunities remain in the pipeline, the majority have not been lost. They've simply shifted later than expected. We continue to believe that we have a high probability of success in securing $38 million of these opportunities within our total pipeline of $178 million.

Our tender activity remains strong globally, Current delays reflect regulatory timing and administrative bottlenecks. And as Jim mentioned, competitors have cited similar headwinds. The underlying demand environment for fire services and protected gear remains intact. We remain highly confident in our major tenders currently in the late stages.

Feedback from end users and procurement teams remain positive. Delays have been driven by certification cycles and administrative timing not competitive losses, and our confidence remains high. Though we are not assigning timing commitments to these opportunities, except to say majority of the $38 million of opportunities we believe will hit in FY '27.

Fire service margins remain structurally sound. The temporary compression came from the volume timing and low absorption during the delays. As volume normalizes and tenders convert margins are expected to recover without requiring broad pricing actions.

For our sales team, the priority is to build a dependable base of monthly sales that is not dependent on large tenders or seasonal cycles. This means expanding distributor engagement tightening forecast accuracy, strengthening bid coverage across brands and accelerating new product commercialization.

Our global fire strategy remains intact heading into next fiscal year. The product portfolio is broader and stronger at any time in the company's history. The Jolly NFPA launch is progressing, LHD Europe is stabilizing and we're positioning the entire fire platform across the upcoming global cycle.

I'll now pass the call to Cameron to cover our industrial and chemical critical environment sectors.

Cameron Stokes
Chief Commercial Officer of Global Industrials

Thanks, Barry. During the third quarter, industrial demand softened across several industrial channels faster than expected. Distributors reduced inventory, certain customers deferred purchases and competitive pricing tightened in pockets of the market. Our forecasting did not capture these shifts quickly enough, creating the variance between expected and actual performance. We are seeing cyclical adjustments in certain channels, not long-term erosion. Several customer segments and geographies show stabilization signals and we expect run rate predictability to improve as customer inventories normalize.

In response, forecasting has been unified into a consistent process across all industrial regions with more rigorous mid-month accuracy checks and tighter reconciliation with distributor data. We've shifted to channel-level segmentation, so forecasting reflects real behavior inside customer groups rather than broad regional assumptions.

Looking to our competitors, share movement has been limited and localized. Pricing pressure has increased in spots where certain competitors have short-term tariffs or sourcing advantages. We are addressing this with selective incentives aimed at volume stability while managing overall margin discipline.

Our sales strategy requires rebuilding distributor run rates reengaging customers who deferred purchases, tightening CRM and channel discipline and stabilizing the chemical and critical environment segment. These actions create a predictable foundation of volume. When delayed tenders, certifications and turnaround activity return, that volume becomes upside that drops directly to operating leverage.

The goal is stable, predictable growth driven by improved forecasting accuracy, stronger distributor engagement, recovery and delayed chemical and critical environment orders, disciplined channel management. We are focused on building consistency rather than volatility.

With that, I'd like to pass the call to Calven to cover our financial results.

J. Calven Swinea

Thank you, Cameron, and hello, everyone. I'll provide a quick overview of our fiscal 2026 3rd quarter financials before diving into the details.

Revenue for the quarter grew $1.8 million year-over-year to $47.6 million, an increase of 4% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2025. Consolidated gross margin decreased to 29.7% from 40.6% for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 and while our adjusted gross margin decreased to 31.3% as compared to 41.7% in the year-ago period. Adjusted operating expenses increased by $0.4 million from $14.3 million in Q3 of last year to $14.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2026 primarily due to inorganic growth.

Net loss was $16 million or $1.64 per basic and diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and compared to net income of $100,000 or $0.01 per basic and diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2025.

Adjusted EBITDA, excluding FX, was $0.2 million for the quarter, a decrease of $4.5 million or 95% compared with $4.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding FX margin in the third quarter of fiscal 2026 was 5.5%, a decrease of 988 basis points from 10.3% and in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 and a decrease of 918 basis points from 9.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2026.

Cash and cash equivalents were $17.2 million on October 31, 2025 compared to $17.5 million on January 31, 2025. On a consolidated basis, for the third quarter of fiscal 2026, domestic sales were $19.2 million representing 40% of total revenues, and international sales were $28.4 million, accounting for 60% of total revenues as our recent Veridian acquisition contributed to increased U.S. revenue. This compares with domestic sales of $15.4 million or 34% of the total and international sales of $30.4 million or 66% in the third quarter of fiscal 2025.

Looking at our third quarter of fiscal 2026, our quarterly revenue faced challenges globally. Sales from recent acquisitions accounted for $10.1 million, while organic sales were $37.5 million. Sales of the fire services product line increased by $6 million year-over-year, driven by $3.4 million in sales from Veridian as well as organic fire services growth of $3 million.

Adjusted gross profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 was $14.9 million, a decrease of $4.2 million or 22% compared to $19.1 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 due to lower sales, higher product costs and tariffs and impacted U.S. gross profit by $3.2 million versus Q2. Adjusted gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 31.3% and the third quarter of fiscal 2026 from 41.7% for the third quarter of fiscal 2025.

On an adjusted basis, operating expenses, excluding foreign exchange, were $14.7 million in the fiscal third quarter, more accurately showcasing the decreases in both our organic and inorganic segments resulting from the new cost reduction initiatives. On a sequential basis, adjusted operating expenses were stable and increasing by $1 million or 1% due to focused cost control measures and the previously mentioned initiatives.

Adjusted EBITDA, excluding FX, was $200,000 for the fiscal third quarter, a decrease of $4.5 million or 95% compared with $4.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 and a decrease of $4.8 million or 98% compared with $5.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2026. The significant decrease was a result of lower performance in North and South America. Adjusted EBITDA FX margin was 0.5% for the most recent quarter, a decrease of 988 basis points from 10.3% in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 and a decrease of 918 basis points from 9.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2026.

Revenue for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2025 was $193.5 million, an increase of $41.7 million or 27% and versus the Q3 fiscal 2025 trailing 12 months revenue of $151.8 million with our recent fire service acquisition supporting Lakeland's continued revenue growth. Trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA, excluding the impact of FX, was $9.3 million compared to $11.7 million for the prior quarter's trailing 12 months. The decrease was driven by lower margin revenue mix increased material and freight costs and tariffs.

Considering we completed 4 acquisitions in the past 12 months, the full integration and implementation, which requires some time, we believe the resulting synergies and efficiencies will begin to translate into stronger financial performance in the coming quarters.

Adjusted gross margin percentage decreased in the third quarter of fiscal 2026 to 31.3% compared to 41.7% in the same period last year due to lower acquired company gross margins. increased material supply chain costs and tariffs. Margins in the acquired businesses were impacted by increased material costs.

Adjusted EBITDA, excluding FX, was $0.2 million for the fiscal third quarter a decrease of $4.5 million or 95% compared with $4.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. The decline was driven primarily by significant revenue shortfalls in Latin America, our highest margin region and lower-than-expected sales in the U.S. fire and industrials.

Veridian, LHD and Eagle were also impacted by NFPA certification delays and slower tender conversion globally. These factors more than offset the reductions achieved in operating expenses. We are currently implementing an additional $1.3 million of cost reductions for the fourth quarter.

Reviewing our performance for the third quarter, our most recent acquisition of Veridian contributed $3.4 million in revenue during the quarter, and LHD added $6 million across 3 subsidiaries, Germany, Australia and Hong Kong. We expect sales from our fire services to accelerate as we fulfill open orders, capitalize on cross-selling opportunities and execute on our sales and tender pipeline.

Looking at our organic business. Our U.S. revenue decreased 3% to $15 million from $15.4 million, driven by declines in our industrial business due to tariff uncertainty. Our European revenue, including Eagle Jolly and our recently acquired LHD business, increased 6% to $15.2 million. We continue to see very good sales opportunities in Europe and are committed to its growth trajectory.

Our Latin American operations experienced a $0.8 million decrease in sales from $5 million in the year ago period to $4.2 million in the current quarter, primarily due to ongoing delayed purchase decisions resulting from political uncertainty. In Asia, sales decreased 19% year-over-year from $3.6 million to $2.9 million.

Regarding product mix for fiscal year-to-date 2026, our fire services businesses grew to 49% of revenues versus 39% for fiscal year 2025 driven by a full 9 months of region sales and organic gains in the U.S. For our industrial product line, disposables accounted for 26% of the year-to-date revenue, while chemicals accounted for 11%. The remainder of our industrial products, including high performance and high vis accounted for 14% of sales.

Now turning to the balance sheet. Lakeland ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $17 million and long-term debt of $37.1 million. This compares to $17.5 million in cash and $16.4 million in long-term debt as of January 31, 2025. As of October 31, 2025, our long-term debt of $37.1 million included borrowings of $33.2 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an additional $6.8 million of available credit under the loan agreement. We were in compliance with all our credit facility covenants.

In August, we sold our Decatur, Alabama property for $6.1 million less customary commissions and closing fees and applied 100% of the net proceeds to repay our revolving credit facility.

Net cash used in operating activities was $17.6 million in the 9 months ended October 31, 2025 compared to $12.5 million in the 9 months ended October 31, 2024. The increase was driven by a decline in profitability previously discussed, ERP implementation costs and an increase in working capital of $7.9 million.

Capital expenditures totaled $0.8 million for the 9 months ended October 31, 2025, primarily related to replacement equipment for our manufacturing sites and develop technology projects. We anticipate FY '26 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.2 million.

Lastly, given near-term headwinds and in order to prudently manage our cash, the company has made the decision to suspend its quarterly cash dividend on our common stock. We believe reinvesting profits into growth opportunities such as acquisitions, our market expansion is a better return for shareholders in the future. The payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend on the company's financial conditions, results of operations, capital requirements and any other factors deemed relevant by the Board.

At the end of Q3, inventory was $87.9 million, down from $90.2 million at the end of Q2 fiscal year 2026. We have recently initiated a series of targeted actions to optimize inventory levels across specific categories. Our immediate priorities include U.S. industrial, Jolly, LHD and Veridian, where we see the greatest opportunity to align balances with demand and improve efficiency. Inventory of acquired companies totaled $14.3 million versus $7 million last year. $6 million of the acquired companies increase came from the Veridian acquisition and LHD's inventory increased by $1.3 million versus last year. Year-over-year, we saw an increase in our organic inventory of $7.9 million versus the quarter ended October 31, 2024.

Organic finished goods were $38.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, up $5.6 million year-over-year and down $0.5 million quarter-over-quarter. Organic raw materials were $33 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, up $2.1 million year-over-year and down $0.4 million quarter-over-quarter.

With that overview, I'd like to turn the call back over to Jim before we begin taking questions.

James Jenkins
President, CEO & Executive Chairman

Thank you, Calven. In conclusion, we continue to demonstrate net sales growth, reflecting the strength of our underlying business. This growth is further supported by a 31% year-over-year increase in our fire services. Our robust pipeline of approximately $178 million, includes approximately $38 million in near-term high-probability opportunities, providing momentum heading into fiscal year '27.

We are now starting to see tender wins for calendar Q1 2026 across the entire product portfolio. These opportunities are positioning us for expanded operating leverage with expense reductions and expanded margins as tenders deliver margins above normalized profile.

Our near-term strategy is focused on navigating the continued challenges from the evolving macro environment while expanding top line revenue in our fire services and industrial verticals. By maintaining a focus on operating and manufacturing efficiencies, we believe we are well positioned to deliver higher margins and improve free cash flow all against the backdrop of ongoing macro uncertainties.

Looking long term, our strategy remains to grow both our fire services and industrial PPE verticals through our strategically located company-owned capital-light model. By maintaining a focus on operating and manufacturing efficiencies, we believe we are positioned to grow faster than the markets we serve. Our acquisition pipeline also remains robust with active discussions underway in line with our overall growth strategy. Although challenges have affected our forecasting ability and we have withdrawn our formal guidance, we expect top line revenue growth in the high single-digit revenue growth across global operations over the next 3 quarters.

We are targeting 10% to 12% adjusted EBITDA margins with incremental growth in EBITDA margins over the next 3 quarters. Looking further ahead, we expect 15% to 17% adjusted EBITDA margins over the next 3 years through cost discipline operational consolidation and targeted commercial investments. As we look forward to the future, we are confident that our continued focus on targeted acquisitions will serve as key growth drivers over the next 3 to 4 years. We are actively engaging in discussions aligned with our decontamination rental and services growth strategy. We look forward to sharing upcoming milestones in the weeks and months ahead.

With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator?
