[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.

Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

On one of the observations -- one of the observations that the market has is under your tenure, Costco's had a greater willingness to move with speed, embrace technology in a different modes of retail and changed a bit more than in the past. Is that a fair conclusion? And given the benefits of these actions that you're taking, which is greater productivity and efficiency, would you be willing to continue to let the financial benefits fall to the bottom line? Or do you see a greater need to reinvest back in the business in areas like price to continue to drive the talk, right?

Ron Vachris
President, CEO & Director

You're welcome, Michael. You know, technology and bringing the company along has been a focus for several years. We've had the spend -- a couple of years ago, we really focused on our fundamental base systems and our core systems behind the scenes that will allow us to build for the future. And so we're now coming to a fruition where we're starting to see the benefits of that hard work of all the backroom systems that we had to build that are now coming to light and coming to the front phase for our members. We feel that technology is going to be part of the -- big part of our future. I think it's equally as important as all of our other initiatives that we have out there, but we will never succumb to not being the best price and driving prices down for our members. That's what Costco is known for, and that will always be our leading mantra.

And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.

Christopher Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So quick follow-up on the latter and then the [ former ] question and then a second question. So as you think about results recently, they're strong in absolute standards. I think the market holds you to very high standards. Is there any concern that you see on the traffic side where there's more of an impetus to invest in price. And then secondly, it looks like executive members per week grew at an accelerated pace from 4Q to 1Q. How are you looking at that in terms of the overall benefit of extending the hours both in terms of the lift that you're seeing in sales? And is this also driving accelerated sign-up.

Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks for the questions, Chris. First of all, I guess, on your point around sales and overall sort of membership growth in the business, I think from our perspective, we look at it very much over the last really 6 to 12 months. And when we look at the sort of trends and step back from what we're seeing with the member, there's a lot of consistency, actually. Overall, I think we've shared in the last couple of quarters. When we talk about what members are looking for, they're looking for value and for quality and for newness. And I think we've done a great job, our buyers and operators have done a great job of bringing that to our members.

And when you look at month by month, there's definitely been some lumpiness in the individual monthly sales results that we posted. But a lot of that has been to do with whether it was uncertainty around tariffs 1 month to another or port strikes that we have to cycle. And if you sort of take a step back and look at the last 7 months that we've reported in the last 2 quarters, our average sales have been around that 6.5% growth. We had 6.4% comps adjusted for gas and FX in Q4. We had 6.4% Q1 this quarter.

And actually, if you look at every individual month, there was only 2 months in that last 7 months that were outside of the range of 6% to 7%. So I think sometimes there's a bit of fixation on individual month or one particular point of data. But actually, when we look at what we're seeing with the overall sort of patterns of how members are shopping and how they're behaving, we've seen a very sort of consistent pattern and a consistency in the results. So our goal is to really continue to make sure we're delivering on that value, quality and newness and ensure that we continue to see that growth in membership accounts in their frequency of visiting and in the items that they're putting in the basket.

And generally, when you look across whether it's nonfood, food and sundries and fresh we've seen consistency in performance and growing market share in those areas. So we'll continue to focus on making sure we're delivering on that value, but feel good about the overall sort of consistency in the results that we've been seeing.

I think from a -- I think the second part of your question maybe was around executive membership. And yes, I think we've been very pleased with the membership response to the extended operating hours. And also, you may remember, we added $10 per month as an extra benefit for executive members who shop on Instacart. The extended opening hours that we did was certainly a major benefit for our executive members, having an extra hour in the morning on most days to shop the warehouse. But we also added an extra hour on a Saturday evening for all of our members. And if you think about the earlier hours, it often extends the total shopping members in the warehouse. So it spreads out the traffic, if you like, to make the experience better for all our members. So we felt very positive about the change that we've seen. It's certainly been well received by members. We've seen a really nice uptick in executive upgrades to your point. And it gets hard to track the spend uplift because of the further away from the change you go, it's more difficult to sort of parse the differences that are happening in the impact on sales. But we still think that sort of 1% lift was a reasonable kind of view of what we think the impact was.

And of course, as I mentioned earlier, you see sort of different puts and takes that I would sort of -- if I look at our overall sort of sales trends, I think I look at it as it's probably offset some of that cycling of gift cards and gold that we were expecting at this time of year. And we've been able to maintain that overall sales growth even with those impacts.

And our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.

Simeon Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

My question is on warehouse openings in the U.S., I think we're going to get to the highest number, something like 20 years next year. So do you do anything different from a membership perspective? I know we're lapping some of the short-term promotions that you did on membership. Is there anything you do different as you approach next year?

Ron Vachris
President, CEO & Director

No, I don't think so. Next year's openings will be a good mix of some infills in established markets, and we still have some opportunities in some new markets. And so several of the infill locations don't result in a whole lot of sign-ups, but really drive a lot of top line sales because it really addresses the frequency aspect of things. And then the new markets that we've done several of those this year, and we have a few more slated for next year of markets that we may have been a little reluctant to go into, we've got much greater confidence at this point and we'll garner a much better new sign-up approach in those markets as well. So a lot of -- continuing on what we've done before, but some different type of scenarios as we move forward in the U.S.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen.

Oliver Chen
TD Cowen, Research Division

On the technology side, it's been really exciting. As we think about retail media, there are plenty of companies that really want to work with you deeply on digital advertising. Would love your thoughts there. And also as you approach the marketplace in a customer-centric way, love to have your thoughts on that development. And finally, AI and gas. AI has so many applications across the customer experience as well as employees and inventory management. What's on your road map for how that will innovate your business going forward?

Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks for the question, Oliver. Yes, I'll take the retail media question first. Yes, we talked about retail media a few times now on the calls, and I definitely believe that it's a meaningful opportunity for us. I always like to start the conversation on retail media though to remind everybody that we have a pretty large alternative profit business that many other retailers would define that way today. And I called out a couple of them on the call today outside of financial services. We have a large travel business. We have a traditional sort of media revenue business that we generate meaningful dollars today. And both of those were actually travel and the sort of marketing and media revenue were tailwinds to our business in the quarter. So there's a number of strengths that we have today in that space that are part of our model that I think showed through in the ability to keep investing in the member and still expanding our operating margins during the quarter.

That being said, we think of retail media as a slightly different opportunity from those because it really is about tapping into that marketing spend that many of our suppliers are investing in other places to drive their marketing awareness and drive return on ad spend. We are in the early innings. I would still say of retail media. We've been building out, as Ron alluded to earlier, the sort of data and tech platform that allows us to execute personalization at scale.

And I think for us, the first priority with personalization is to deliver a better member experience is to deliver more targeted relevant messaging so we drive more items in the basket, more visits to the warehouse, more visits online. And as you do those things, it just creates an even more compelling value proposition for our media partners. While we're building and executing on that capability, we've been introducing some media activity on third-party sites. So I think of that as being -- you may have seen, you have the Costco Auto program that will run on digital TV, and we've done some targeted MVM amplification campaigns with some of our partners that have been very successful as well. We also recently launched advertising on our gas pumps as a new channel for us as well around new media opportunities.

So I think the headlines would be, we're seeing some early success, but it's still very much an opportunity in the future on the road map for us. And a bit like Ron mentioned earlier, all of our focus is on how do we drive more value for the member. So as you might expect, the vast majority of the value we create here will reinvest in the member to drive down prices and value and increase sales. And we actually think that's a real advantage with the national brand partners that we work with on media because they know that we're committed to really driving the flywheel and driving growth in their overall business.

Ron Vachris
President, CEO & Director

And on the AI front, we're extremely excited about what the future holds for us. I mean we see many opportunities that are really business-driven and tangible -- have great tangible business value for us and you look at things like our procurement system as we are a global retailer and we buy from around the world as well as supply chain, what it can do there. And just the tools that we've seen that this has improved our employees' work abilities and their skill sets as well as they do their day-to-day work. So we see a lot of value. We're very excited about the journey.

We look at it in a 2-phase approach that concurrently, we're going to be focusing on member-facing, how do we improve the experience for the member through AI and then business in basics, how do we continue to focus on the business basics. Our mantra is to bring goods to market at the lowest possible price. And we think AI has a great asset to that, and it really can help us become a much better merchant out there.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.

Charles Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

In your annual report, your sales waterfall chart is impressive. The class of '25, $192 million in sales versus $150 million in 2023. Can you help us think about the opportunity to continue to expand on this front and the steps you're taking to continue to improve productivity within the store?

Ron Vachris
President, CEO & Director

We see a good horizon on expansion. We continue to -- the creativity, I mentioned just a couple of examples of things that we're doing differently. We've got a project in Los Angeles, where we're working with some developers that there's some affordable housing going above Costco, just north of LAX. That project will open up in 2027. And that would be a market that we could -- it's Baldwin Hills where it's called. That would be a market we would never be able to go to and find 25 acres to build a Costco. It just wouldn't happen. So we're finding creative ways to get closer to our members and to relieve some pressure from some of our highest volume locations.

And again, like I said, we continue to see some opportunities in markets that we would have questioned in the past due to maybe some competition is there, but we feel much stronger going in and attacking these markets. So like I said in the early opening remarks, good runway for 30-plus locations as we look forward for the next few years, for sure, and a good combination of both type of openings. And international still presents some very good strengths for us. In our recent Sweden opening our second location in Sweden, our third in France, and we've got quite a few in Asia that are upcoming as well. So we feel really strong about our future expansion.

Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO

And Chuck, I think on the point on the growth per warehouse, I think Ron's final point there is a really important one around the balance that we're able to get. So we find with many of the U.S. and Canada warehouses where we're filling in, we can accelerate the sales very quickly because Costco is known, we're sort of filling capacity where maybe there's some very busy warehouses around. So it really helps the economic model, we're getting returns from the quick acceleration in sales growth. And then in the international markets or places where we have less penetration of warehouses, it really drives a significant increase in new member count. So it's nice to have a balance between those 2. The returns look a little bit different in how you get there, but they both generate strong return on investment in different ways, and they create a nice balance in the business overall as we grow.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.

Katharine McShane
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

The renewal -- the renewal rate softness sounded better than what you expected. Could you maybe talk to some of the things you did to try and offset the softness from the more digital members?

Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. Yes, you're exactly right. When we talked about the membership renewal rate last quarter, we shared that as a result of this change in mix around us adding more new digitally engaged members or signing up digitally to become a Costco member. What we've always seen with that group is that they're generally a bit younger. And generally speaking, they renew at a slightly lower rate. That's always been true, but there's a bigger number of them now coming into the base. So as they flow into the math model, it was -- it's impacting the overall renewal rate. And so I think you may have heard us talk last quarter, we said we think of while that's sort of a mathematical fact, we think there are opportunities for us to be able to change that outcome by delivering more targeted and relevant communication to those members that have signed up digitally and are reaching that point in maturity where they're considering whether to renew or not to renew their membership with us.

And so our membership team is really focused on delivering targeted relevant messaging to engage those members to ensure they continue to see the value of the membership and really helping them see why there's significant value for them to continue to be members. And what you saw in this quarter was really some of the early work the team has done to engage those members and improve the renewal rate. And obviously, it's early days.

So we want to make sure that we can continue to build that momentum. But it's been encouraging to see the impact of those changes. And we were expecting, based on purely flowing through the sort of the renewal rate that we've seen before to see a slightly higher decline in the quarter, and we were able to offset a part of that with the changes that we made in communicating with members.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird.

Peter Benedict
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I want to ask about digital. Maybe if there's any metrics you guys can share with the success you're having, maybe the -- how many -- what percentage of the membership that's engaging with you digitally now versus before? I don't think I may have missed it, but any stats around Costco Logistics. How you're doing with delivery there.

Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. Thanks for the question, Peter. Yes, we haven't typically talked about the percentage of members that we are engaging with digitally. It does continue to grow, as you might imagine, as we're continuing to make enhancements to the website to the app and really as we're delivering more relevancy to members through those channels. And so we are continuing to see growth. We did share in the prepared remarks that traffic was up 24% during the quarter on the website, and it was up even higher than that in the 40% plus range on the app during the quarter.

So we continue to be pleased with the momentum that we're seeing in digital engagement with our members. And our expectation would be that digital sales, as we define it, would continue to grow at a faster pace over the longer term than our average sales overall as more members engage digitally, and we're able to use some of those targeted personalized communication tools to really help members see the relevancy of all the offers that we have online, but also to use those channels to help drive higher engagement into the warehouse as well and really creating a seamless experience across the channels.

Ron Vachris
President, CEO & Director

Very excited about what we have coming in the app. I mean more engagement, more locking in the brick-and-mortar business with the virtual digital business as well. And as we continue to roll out enhancements we've got pay ahead for the pharmacy coming. We've got ordering cakes and deli trays online coming. So many of the things that we've heard from our members that could be a little bit clunky are now moving to a digital state, and we're seeing great adoption right out of the chute. So we continue to -- we see some upside to the continued growth and the digital value of having the app and using the digital membership card, the Costco Wallet. Those things have all got a very nice road map in the next 12 months and we see that number is going to hopefully continue to outpace the growth of the warehouse.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.

John Heinbockel
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Two real estate questions. A lot of opportunity internationally. What does the pipeline look like, both in some of your European countries and Asia? I know it takes a while. And then secondly, you mentioned remodels, which I don't think you haven't talked about too much. What is the remodel philosophy in the U.S.? How many do you do? What's the extent of that. What's the lift. I don't know how impactful that is.

Ron Vachris
President, CEO & Director

Do you want to -- I can start. Good runway internationally. We see some good growth in Europe, especially in Spain and the U.K. We have got a lot of good things going on there, and we see that those 2 countries will be ramping up. We continue to see very, very good strength in Asia and so that market, we see the next 5 years, and we think that those projects do -- like you mentioned, do take a little bit longer, but they're going to start coming to fruition. So we'll see a good balance. We've been about 50-50, half of the expansion in the U.S. and half outside of the U.S. And now we're seeing even more opportunities in Canada and North America and Mexico. So a good balance, about half of the 30 should be outside the U.S. we see in the next 5 years.

Expansions and relocations, we normally do about 5 to 6 relocations a year. The uplift is dramatic. When we do these, we normally are moving a building that is underserving the market and goes into a larger facility, better parking. If we have a gas station, expanded gas or we add gas to it and a wide variety of uptake to extreme 50%, 60% increases when you add a gas station and really add a lot of parking to a 20% uplift to a building that had everything just got into a better facility.

So we strategically look at that. And then we are continuously investing in our current warehouses too, to make sure that we're updating the fresh foods areas. We're bringing the new ancillary businesses in there. So it's a process we go through every year of planning ahead, and we look out several years and a good combination of all 3 new locations, relocations and taking care of the existing buildings that we're doing business in as well.

And our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.

Rupesh Parikh
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

I just want to go back to the comments on SG&A leverage. So it sounds like this quarter, higher health care costs prevented your team from leveraging costs. So just curious about the dynamics there. And then as you think about productivity, just how do you think about the runway there? It sounds like it could continue for a few more quarters.

Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks for the question, Rupesh. Yes, you've summarized it pretty well, actually, from how we looked at the quarter. If I just take a step back, there were kind of 4 main sort of headwinds or investments, if you like, that we had during the quarter when you think about the impact on the warehouses. The first, of course, is the investments that we make through our employee agreement each year. So that was the [ March '25 ] agreement. And that on an incremental basis, we're sort of mid-single digits headwind that the team had to kind of overcome in improving productivity. The second was, of course, the extended operating hours that we implemented in June. And then you mentioned it that we had higher health care costs in the quarter. We've generally seen, of course, health care cost increasing. This was perhaps the first quarter where we've seen health care costs grow at a faster pace than our sales.

So we saw a little bit of a headwind overall from health care costs in the quarter. And then we also had the 4 basis point impact from the tax charge that relates back to multiple years ago that we took during the quarter as well. So overall, we were 1 basis point negative on productivity. If we have not had the sort of sales and use tax charge that we had during the quarter. And without the health care cost, we'd have been sort of mid-single digit also positive leverage during the quarter without those sort of factors.

Now I would say, as you look forward, we're still going to have, of course, the continued investment that we've already implemented around wages. So we have to continue to support those costs. We've implemented the extended opening hours. We think the operators have done a great job of absorbing that, as you've seen in the last couple of quarters. The health care costs, that's something we're taking action to make sure that we're comfortable with the trends that we're seeing. But of course, there's possibilities those costs could continue to be higher in the future. We wouldn't expect to have the sort of the 4 basis point impact that we had from tax.

So when -- I think when you take all those things and look at it going forward, we've historically said that we need to get to about mid-single-digit sales to be able to leverage SG&A. And I think with the work the team has done to offset extended operating hours, the work the team has done to offset the employee agreement. I think we're in that kind of ballpark. And actually in the first quarter, have we not have had the adjustment for sales tax, I think, we'd have actually seen some leverage during the quarter. So I think that's the way to sort of think about it overall.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.

Gregory Melich
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Gary, I think you mentioned that inflation was running similar. I just wanted to make sure I got the numbers right. It was up low single digits in general merchandise. Was food inflationary or not in the quarter? And how do you see that trending?

Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Food and fresh -- food and sundries and fresh, Greg, would have been slightly inflation. So low single -- low to mid-single digits. No real change really from last quarter. The are quite a few puts and takes in there, as I mentioned in the prepared comments that you've got a few of the commodities that would be inflationary right now when you look at items like beef and seafood and coffee, but then you've got produce, which is deflationary currently, and there are other items like eggs and cheese, which are still inflationary year-over-year, but a lower inflation than they were earlier in the year. So you've got kind of puts and takes that are offsetting each other, which really essentially sort of leveled it all out at the same level as it was for the last couple of quarters.

Gregory Melich
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

It -- would it be fair to say that most of the ticket growth in comp was driven by inflation?

Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO

I think there'll be a combination of both in there. We have -- and remember for us, there's -- inflation for us the way we measure it would be -- it could be the members buying a bigger pack size or it could be the members buying an upgraded item of new electronic or appliance. So I think you kind of have to look at it, there's sort of probably -- or there is a combination of some level of natural inflation on like-for-like items, some level of inflation of members buying bigger pack sizes and increasing -- moving to the newer model, if you like, and then some level of unit growth as well in there.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.

Edward Kelly
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to dig into total paid members. You've had remarkable growth over the last few years. Model has obviously resonated. And 5% this quarter is still very good. But it has slowed a little over the last few quarters. I was wondering if you could just maybe discuss what you're seeing there. Is that more so in the U.S. And then have you seen any stabilization in that? I think the math would kind of suggest that maybe exit rate lower than 5.2%. So just thoughts there.

Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Ed. Yes, membership, as you mentioned, in general, we've been really pleased with the results that we've seen in the quarter with the new members and the younger population that we're recruiting, the acceleration in upgrades and overall growth that you mentioned just over 5% and exec up 9%. So we're pleased with the results that we've seen overall. I think your point is accurate that if you look at the year-over-year growth, it has slowed a little bit from where it's been over the last couple of years. And I think some of that is just starting to cycle some strong growth in the last year or so. But we still feel really good about the health of the membership growth.

And we think there's a lot of continued opportunities to maintain that growth in the future. I know Ron mentioned a few of them in one of the questions we answered earlier, but with -- partly with the existing warehouses that we're -- I think we're in a good position where every year, we've been opening 20 to 30 warehouses and we can see the maturity curve of the increase in the number of members that sign up as warehouses mature.

We're obviously opening new warehouses each year. And in particular, to your point, in international, we tend to see a much higher number of new member sign-ups and as that mix continues to blend out to sort of closer to 50-50 between international and the U.S. We do think with the actions that we're taking, as I mentioned also earlier on the call around improving renewal rates, there's an opportunity to help that trend as well. And then we're committed to continuing to improve the value of the membership. We've made obviously some major changes recently with the extended opening hours and the Instacart benefits and 5% gas on the credit card, but we'll continue to look for ways to add greater membership value. So I think it's accurate to say that it's a little bit slower than it has been, but we feel good about the momentum and the opportunity to continue to grow.

And our next question comes from the line of Zhihan Ma with Bernstein.

Zhihan Ma
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

So on the nonfood side of things, I think your comp is now in the mid-single-digit percentage range. Can you just update us on when you expect to [ unlap ] the tough comps from the gift card sales? And does that timing coincide with the tax refunds or the incremental ones that consumers are going to get, especially middle to higher income consumers early next year, will you start to see some more outsized benefit in that category?

Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think overall, obviously, we generally don't provide sort of comments on forward looking, what we would expect. I think what we would say around nonfoods is that the team's done a great job of continuing to deliver exciting items at great value and quality. And we see while we have -- I think your comment is accurate that the growth year-over-year has come down to low double digits into that mid-single-digit range. And I think you've heard us mention before and you referenced it, that some of that really is starting to cycle the impact of gold being sold in warehouse and online and also some of the gift card programs that we had last year. But overall, we still see good market share gains in really pretty much all of the nonfood categories.

And we saw -- you may have heard us mention in the prepared comments that gold and jewelry, special events, health and beauty were all double digits. We also saw high single-digit growth in majors, in tires and small appliances. And I didn't mention apparel during the call earlier, but that's also showing really strong improvement in sales momentum and comp growth as well. So I think our perspective on nonfood is that we think our teams are doing a really good job in delivering great value for the member. And we think we have a clear path to continue to grow our market share in nonfood by continuing to deliver on that promise to our members. And that's really where our focus is.

And our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities.

Scot Ciccarelli
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

I guess another question on warehouse expansion. What are your latest thoughts around long-term warehouse potential, both in the U.S. and in total. And then second, I think all of the lower price examples you gave were Kirkland products. So are most of your heaviest price investments on your private brand products.

Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. On the first part of the question, Scot, I think Ron briefly alluded to it earlier as well, we tend to look at 5 to 10 years out in terms of our real estate plans, and we would still see a really good road map for 30-plus warehouses a year is the goal that we have, at least achieving 30 new warehouses a year is the goal that we set for ourselves. And when we look at that 5- to 10-year plan, we see opportunities for growth in all the markets and geographies that we're operating in today. So generally speaking, we're expecting around half, maybe slightly over half to be in the U.S. and then just around half just slightly under half to be in the rest of the markets that we operate in. So think of that being Canada, Mexico, Europe, Asia, Australia, across those different markets. And I wouldn't say it's 1 specific geography, it's really fairly well spread across those markets to continue to build our presence in each of those different geographies.

On the second part of your question around Kirkland Signature. I think it's more a reflection of we tend to have, obviously, a very strong understanding of the costs involved in those items, and we want to be always the first to lower prices for our members and the last to increase them. And so buyers and our category managers who look at those items, whenever we see an opportunity either to work with our partners or to find ways to buy more effectively. We want to be looking for those opportunities. So in most of those cases, that's really working very closely with our suppliers to look at what we're seeing in the cost base and working creatively to either increase buying globally so that we can improve our economies of scale or looking at ways to operate more efficiently without ever compromising on the quality of the item.

And those would be all great examples of where our teams really looked and found opportunities to bring down the price and increase the value for our members.

And our next question comes from the line of David Bellinger with Mizuho.

David Bellinger
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Regarding the personalization efforts, those seem to be working pretty well early on. How much further does that have to roll out? Is it hitting every member at this point and any specific examples you can share on the conversion or the sales uplift that some of these personalization changes are helping with today?

Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, we have been pleased, as you heard Ron mentioned in the comments around the progress that we made on personalization, where we really are now starting to use our membership data to look for ways, how can we really make the experience better for the member? How do we improve the convenience for them, how do we help them see the most relevant messages that help them get to the best value from Costco? I still think there's plenty of road map and opportunity for us to continue to improve. First of all, we're relatively early on the journey. So we're learning what do our members really like, where are the places we can fine-tune and improve those communications and the places in which they show up.

I still think there are a number of elements on our road map where we still see parts of the experience that our members have that we can make that personalization more relevant, whether that's the items and the order in which they see on things like the MVM or whether it's the way in which we deliver e-mail communication to our members. So we still see a really strong runway to continue to improve.

We don't really talk about metrics. I think our focus is much more on how we're driving overall member experience and top line sales. So some of these things are intended to improve the way the members are able to engage in our warehouses or the way they're able to buy online. So we tend to look at it more. Is it driving an improvement in member engagement? And is that helping drive our digital sales, which we continue to expect to grow at a faster pace overall than our warehouse business. And is it driving more member engagement overall. And we've been really pleased with the results so far in that journey.

And our next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO.

I was hoping to go back to the topic of renewal rates a little bit. I know you don't prefer to guide or forecast, but I think you did say, Gary, we might see still a decline in the renewal rate in the next few quarters. So I was just wondering if that's a little bit of conservatism because it sounds like you are having some success on mitigating that dynamic. Just wondering if you could comment on that. But also if you were to pull out that cohort of the younger members would the membership rates be improving, excluding that? Or can you share any of a deeper dive on that renewal rate dynamic?

Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. Yes, really the -- Kelly, the impact that we've been talking about really is attributable to this phenomena that I've mentioned on the call earlier around as we add in, and it sounds like you fully understand the sort of concept of what's happening with the membership base overall. But as we've brought more of these digitally sign up members who are generally younger that just they do renew a lower rate. So really, the impact that we've talked about the last few quarters on renewal rate is a function of those members moving into the renewal rate overall. So that really is what's driving the -- what has driven the slight decline that we've seen over recent quarters.

To your point, our goal obviously is to arrest that decline as quickly as possible. And certainly, we're encouraged by what we saw this last quarter with the improvements that we made through the more targeted and relevant communication to members who we know have signed up through that channel. So we're very encouraged by what we've seen so far. Our goal is to stop that decline and to reverse that decline as quickly as we possibly can as we're only 1 quarter into the change that we made. We wanted to flag that, of course, there's still work to be done there. And we are still at a lower renewal rate on digital sign-ups than we are on warehouse sign-ups. And so our expectation of ourselves is to close that gap as quickly as possible, but we want to be transparent in all that we share that there's still work for us to do. And there is a possibility the next couple of quarters could still show a slight decline because of the factors that I've mentioned in prior calls.

And our final question comes from the line of Spencer Hanus with Wolfe Research.

Just curious if you could talk about the cadence of comps you saw through November and then into December. And how that's informing how the consumer is holding up heading into the holiday from your vantage point? And then are you seeing any trade down or divergence in performance by customer cohort that is changing how you guys are buying.

Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I think -- thanks for the question. I think we don't obviously get into talking about specifically our current quarter because we report our sales on a monthly basis. But overall, I would say we're seeing relative consistency in how our members are shopping. I mentioned it earlier that we've -- we have seen month-to-month some, I call it, bumpiness, if you like, in the sales, but most of that's been attributable to whether it's cycling, port strikes or consumer uncertainty, 1 month with tariffs and then the sales come back the next month. And if we look at the last 6 months or so, outside of the 2 things that I mentioned around, we've seen continued strong growth in nonfoods and market share gains, but we have seen a deceleration in nonfoods. And I think that that's really been offset when you look at the total comps by the benefit we've seen from extended operating hours. But net-net, really in that sort of 6.5% range when you look at the last 2 quarters over the last 7 months, really, outside of a couple of months being one slightly above and one slightly below that 6% to 7% growth range. And those months are right next to each other.

So when you average out the two, they came in at 6.5% as well. We've been really in that consistent range. So nothing that we'd call out that we're seeing is a change other than the 2 factors I just mentioned in terms of member behavior and the way in which we believe our value is resonating with them.
