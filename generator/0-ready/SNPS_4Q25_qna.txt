[Operator Instructions] The first question today will come from Jason Celino from KeyBanc.

Jason Celino
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Great. Maybe my first one for Shelagh. The embedded organic growth rate in the 2026 guide, I don't know if there's a way for us to understand what that might be and what that might imply for IP growth. I'm okay at math, but I'm just a sell-side analyst. I mean, if we adjust for the Ansys and the divestitures, I'm getting like 8% growth organic. I asked the question because I'm just trying to understand the level of conservatism.

Shelagh Glaser
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, it's definitely in that ballpark. And I think 2 things that I would highlight. One is, and I had it in my prepared remarks, we did have the disposition of the Optical Solutions Group and the PowerArtist Group, it's $110 million. So that's about 1.5 points. So just point that out to you. And as we talked about in Q3, we do anticipate a muted year of growth for IP. We are very much well into repositioning workforce to build out the HPC title so that we've got those fully available for customers. But we do expect the group to be in transition this year. And so we factored in muted growth for the IP business. So you're seeing that. And as I talked about, Ansys, our guide for Ansys is $2.9 billion at the midpoint, and that's double-digit growth for Ansys. So we're trying to be pragmatic with our forecast in light of the body of work that the IP team needs to do in '26 to be able to get us back to the long-term growth rate in IP.

Jason Celino
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then the operating margin EPS guide is pretty fabulous even when considering the extra dilution from the NVIDIA investment. I don't know if I heard you talk about a specific synergy number, but curious if there's any extra details there.

Shelagh Glaser
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So one of the things we had talked about last time that we're well on way to do is the 10% workforce reduction. That encompasses a body of work that we've been doing on synergies. We've already done an action in November time frame. We anticipate that we're largely complete with that in 2026. So we're very much on the path of working to accelerate those synergies as quickly as possible. And as you know, Jason, we've been very focused on driving margin expansion over multiple years with this guide. It's about a 12-point margin expansion since 2020. So we're very focused on that, very focused on driving both sustainable growth and expansion of margin.

The next question is from Harlan Sur, JPMorgan.

Harlan Sur
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

If I exclude Ansys to the person that asked the question before me, the core EDA plus IP is growing about 8%, 8.5% year-over-year in the fiscal year guidance. Can you just help us understand what you're embedding for growth in EDA and IP in the guidance? For example, if I assume IP is growing modestly, as you guys say, let's say, 5%, then your EDA business is growing around 9%, which is still below kind of your forward target of like 12%, 13%. Is that kind of the way to think about it? And if so, like why is the EDA business still undergrowing your long-term sort of forward target CAGRs?

Sassine Ghazi
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thank you, Harlan, for the question. Your math is in the ballpark. What we're taking into account for the EDA growth because on IP, you captured it well, we're guiding a muted growth for IP. In EDA, we're taking a couple of things into account. One, the China environment, where the cumulative impact of restrictions is something that we are seeing and have seen in '25 that has had an impact is different than, say, 2020-'21 time frame where many start-ups and a significant spending was happening in China. And the other factor is we're still operating in a tale of 2 markets. There are a number of companies that they are building chips for industrial, automotive and anything outside the AI infrastructure build, their road map is somewhat muted. They're not driving at the same pace as what we're seeing with the other group of customers that they are delivering chips for the AI infrastructure.

Then, as you know, with EDA, there are a number of components. There is the software and the hardware-assisted verification. On HAV, we continue on seeing a significant demand due to the complexity of verification. The long-term view is double digits, but that's what we have took into account in terms of the guide for '26.

Shelagh Glaser
Chief Financial Officer

And the other thing that I would add, that's just a mechanical item, Harlan, is the divestiture of the Optical Solutions Group and the PowerArtist Group. So that's a $110 million headwind. But that's just a mechanical thing just to add that into what's being outlined.

Harlan Sur
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. No. Got it. That was insightful. And then Shelagh, a question for you. Total expenses exiting Q4 was about $1.43 billion. You're guiding that to roughly about $1.41 billion in the first quarter. But if I look at your average quarterly expense run rate through the year on the full year guidance, it's still averaging about $1.43 billion per quarter. So it kind of doesn't seem like there's much in the way of synergy unlock in fiscal '26? Or are cost synergies being offset by increased spending in other areas? And where do you expect the total expense to be run rating sort of exiting fiscal '26?

Shelagh Glaser
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So our commitment on the cost synergies, you're really seeing that flow through kind of back to Jason's question on the op margin, the 40.5%. Obviously, we've committed to mid-40s long term. So we're well on the way to that. And when we think about kind of the profile of expense structure, it is changing a little bit just because of the ingestion of Ansys as to how the quarterly splits run. But our expectation is throughout the pace of the year, we're going to continue to have reductions in workforce. But we're still going to focus our main investment on driving innovation and driving the road map. And so the reductions will still allow us to have significant investment in R&D.

Next up is James Schneider from Goldman Sachs.

James Schneider
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I was wondering if you could maybe give us a bit of an update on the IP business and your expectations you laid out last quarter around some of the headwinds that you're seeing, whether that be your foundry customer, China and the execution on custom IP blocks. Can you maybe give us an update on sort of the level of progress you've had in each of those 3 dimensions? And how that sort of plays into the overall IP outlook for the year? Do you expect it to be sort of low single digit or you think mid-single digit is possible?

Sassine Ghazi
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, James. I want to start with, as we zoom out, my confidence in our long-term mid-teens for our IP business only gets stronger. I know when we talked 90 days ago, we have focused on some of the headwinds. But the overall strength of the portfolio we have is such a privilege to have the portfolio as we engage our customers in various markets, not only AI HPC because as you know, the market of semiconductor is much broader. Today, we are the leader in providing the IP for automotive, for mobile, for many other segments. In the AI HPC, we have a very strong position. And our customers constantly are reminding us how mission critical we are to their road map and development.

We outlined 90 days ago 3 headwinds: China and the whole foundry update, we're assuming in our guide that not much change going into FY '26. In other words, we are being balanced and pragmatic the way we're taking into account in our guide for IP, these 2 factors. In terms of resources and prioritization, we made a number of changes. We made changes in our development leadership. We made some changes in the sales leadership as it relates to IP. And we are well on our way to close some of the gaps you're going to see from a customer engagement point of view on some -- couple of the titles that we are being pressed on timing of delivery is that we will close these gaps by midyear '26, FY '26. So all in all, we're looking at '26 as a transitional year, muted growth with the long-term objective of mid-teens, and that we feel very strongly about.

James Schneider
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. And then maybe just as a follow-up, obviously, last week, you had your announcement of the NVIDIA partnership and the investment in the company. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color on sort of the rationale for why an investment made sense? What could have been done with an investment that couldn't have been done simply through a strategic partnership and maybe kind of walk us through the logic around that.

Sassine Ghazi
CEO, President & Director

Sure. I'm happy to walk through how it ended up being an investment where the discussion started with NVIDIA is enthusiasm and excitement about the new Synopsys, the silicon to systems engineering solutions that addresses not only the silicon part, it's going up to the whole physical AI and delivering solutions to the future of engineering in every industry. So the discussion with NVIDIA started around how do we accelerate at the computational level with the GPU, and that's something that is already a number of our products. We have a road map for that acceleration. Then it went up to the Omniverse level, how to modernize or the way we refer to it, how do we reengineer engineering for intelligent systems? And this is where the Ansys portfolio is very unique as they bring in a multi-physics simulation leadership to bring that physical simulation, physical AI into effect and providing that modernization of engineering.

The third element is our go-to-market reach. Ansys has built a very strong channel partnership and direct sales channel that we touch thousands and thousands of customers in many industries. So as the discussion with NVIDIA started evolving on defining the technology partnership, the discussion with Jensen moved to, I want to endorse it with investment because I know we can make money. And I know you heard his own words as we announced the partnership. So the financial aspect was second because as you can see, we have a very strong balance sheet. And we welcome the $2 billion investment. And as Shelagh outlined, we will accelerate some of the debt payment and help us with accelerating some of the strategy we have. So that's how it really came about.

Operator

The next question comes from Kelsey Chia from Citi.

Wei Chia
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

So I'd like to tap on the EDA growth rate again. So you mentioned that the lower EDA growth in fiscal year '26 is due to slower chip design momentum in China. Is that the same reason for the lower growth rate this year as well? And are there any share shift dynamics happening over there and if synergies with Ansys could drive that revenue growth back to target?

Sassine Ghazi
CEO, President & Director

Yes. As it relates to China, there is some share shift happening inside China because when you restrict the sale of EDA or IP, the customers in China are looking for alternatives. And that is happening, and it's happening at an accelerated rate. The customers we can serve we're fine selling to and they're buying from Synopsys or other that the companies we cannot sell to, they're looking for alternatives, and these alternatives are typically organic, local EDA or IP companies.

In terms of the longer-term growth opportunities for EDA, and that's why we're still standing behind double-digit growth for EDA is going to come from the joint solutions between Synopsys and Ansys. We are targeting the first half of '26 to deliver the first wave of these solutions. There is the need for customers -- from customers to address the current challenges they are facing as they're designing the most advanced chips, advanced package, 3DIC, where they need the physics analysis to be taken into account during the design phase of the chip. And this is something we're very excited about. The team is already working toward the goal of delivering the first wave of the solution, and that's a monetization opportunity. But of course, that opportunity in terms of monetization will happen over time as customers adopt, et cetera.

The second monetization opportunity is as the Agentic AI solution start maturing and start changing the workflow, that's another opportunity for our industry to rethink how do we sell our solution for the value and impact. So again, the China impact, we're taking it into account in our guide and the upside opportunity as we look at the long term is joint solutions and the AI changing the workflow.

Wei Chia
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Got it. So on the IP business, so I know that Synopsys provides several IP for a large foundry customer, including the EMIB advanced packaging technology, it seems that there are several customers evaluating that, using that technology from a large foundry customer. Will that be incrementally positive for Synopsys given the muted growth that you have provided? And also relating to that on the operating margin, I believe are the expenses related to those IPs have been consistently recognized over the prior quarters despite the lack of customers. So does that imply that operating margins for that segment could trend back to historical average when the revenue for that large foundry customers are being recognized?

Sassine Ghazi
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Let me address the first part of your question, then I'll turn it to Shelagh. The way we monetize our IP, the first step is to build it. And what you build on foundry A is not the same on what you build on foundry B, even though it's the same protocol, the same title. It does require what's called porting. And that's not a simple effort. It requires quite a bit of an R&D effort to achieve the same performance, power, et cetera. Now that's one part of the monetization. But where we look for the incremental monetization is when that foundry start on ramping customers. And if whichever foundry has expansion of customers that are using the technology that we already developed the IP, that's an incremental opportunity for us. And there, we sell to the end customer who is on ramping to the foundry customer. And for us, we're -- as we're looking at FY '26, for that particular foundry that we talked about in Q3, we're assuming a status quo in terms of new customers being on ramp.

Shelagh, if you want to address the operating margin?

Shelagh Glaser
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, sure. So in terms of operating margin, Kelsey, you're right. We still are investing in building the titles out. We've repositioned the workforce to be able to build the HPC titles up, as Sassine talked about, and so it is really -- we're going to have muted growth in '26, which will mean there will be some pressure on the operating margins. But as we get back to that mid-teens growth long term, we'll see expansion in the margins. And I do expect that IP margins are always slightly below the corporate average because it's such a people-intensive body of work to deliver but it's really a short-term effect just because of the kind of the headwinds on revenue of the op margin challenge through '26 on IP.

We'll now here from Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho.

Sitikantha Panigrahi
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

I want to drill into the Ansys. Double-digit growth for next year is pretty good. So I would love to hear what's baked into that in terms of assumptions there? It's been now more than 4 months since you've closed Ansys. Do you expect, in terms of business model or contract, which are different, do you expect them to convert to subscription? And if you do so, what kind of uplift or any kind of multiplier effect we should expect there? And Sassine, in terms of integration, where are you so far? Any color would be helpful.

Sassine Ghazi
CEO, President & Director

Sure. Thank you, Siti, for the question. In terms of what's driving our confidence in double-digit growth for Ansys, the way we look at it, there is 2 markets we're serving with the Ansys portfolio. There is the semiconductor market that the joint solutions will bring an opportunity to uplift our pricing as we integrate the Ansys solution into the EDA solution that we offer today. Then the rest of the Ansys market, if you look at the significant transformation that's happening on how to develop a modern car, robot, any industrial applications, drones, et cetera, aerospace, those are all customers of Ansys. And the demand, the increase in R&D investment that we are seeing in those markets is giving us the confidence to continue on expanding the growth opportunity.

In terms of the business that Ansys has, they've always had a mix of subscription and perpetual. And that will continue based on the customer need, requirement, demand. So that's what's driving the double-digit growth assumption for the portfolio, which, by the way, is no different than what the legacy Ansys team has delivered in the prior year. So it's consistent, in line with prior expectations.

In terms of integration, since we finalized the divestitures in October, we're full force ahead in terms of integrating the teams. Our R&D teams right now, they're one team. They're delivering on the joint solutions I just mentioned. From a go-to-market point of view, we are maintaining a separate go-to-market engagement. The one that they deal with semiconductor. Those are integrated given the relationship Synopsys has with semiconductor companies. And the slew of other customers, and I'm talking multiple factors larger than the classic Synopsys in terms of the space that the legacy Ansys has served, that will remain separate. So we don't miss a beat in terms of how to go to market with the existing portfolio that we have.

Shelagh Glaser
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And I would just add, Siti, that the portion that Sassine talked about of Ansys that's in lockstep with the EDA business, that is moving to a similar ratable, and that's included in our guidance.

Sitikantha Panigrahi
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then I just want to clarify that we need the same customers now using Synopsys EDA and Ansys. When you launch your combined product, should we expect any kind of uplift there? Or what kind of uplift should we expect? I mean, is that 1 plus 1 will be more than 2 or less than $2 there? And Sassine, quickly, any update on that royalty model for IP, you talked about, any traction you're seeing?

Sassine Ghazi
CEO, President & Director

Sure. Yes. When we talk about joint solutions, the customers have the options. They have the choice. If they don't have a need for that new joint solution, they can continue buying the classic Synopsys and legacy Ansys products, and we'll negotiate those based on value and usage and need, et cetera. If the customer is looking for the joint solutions because we're solving a new problem, 1 plus 1 is greater than 2, for sure. And that's where we will capture that monetization opportunity over time as they start adopting the technology. As I stated, the first wave where the customers start using, feeling the technology and evaluating it is the first half of '26.

In terms of the IP value capture, the focus we put together in Q4 that I'm very pleased with. We looked at it from, I want to say, 2 pathways. The first one is just the discipline in pricing and guardrails because we have a differentiated IP portfolio. And I was very pleased with the go-to-market team in monetizing around the newly established, I want to say, guardrail and disciplines we put in place. Then the second aspect of it, and that's where we spent quite a bit of time 90 days ago talking about, there's an increase in customization in IP. And we are having discussions with a number of strategic customers that we're happy to allocate resources to deliver on that work, but we need to change the business model from an NRE plus a use fee to NRE plus use fee plus royalty and upside. And these discussions are happening, and I feel very good that in FY '26, we'll be able to lock up some customers in that new business model where they see the value of bringing that customization and portfolio to their road map.

[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Vivek Arya from Bank of America.

Vivek Arya
BofA Securities, Research Division

For the first one, Sassine, I'm trying to gauge whether the IP business is derisked because if I look at your Q4 IP, and I just annualize that, that's about $1.6 billion and change. But if I assume that it grows modestly, that's more like $1.8 billion, right, or so. So from a year-on-year perspective, it seems derisked, but off of Q4 levels, not as much. And I wanted to get your sense, is that a fair pushback? Just how are you thinking about the sequential recovery in your IP business? And if Shelagh, you have a number for Q1, that would be very helpful also.

Sassine Ghazi
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I really urge you not to look at it at -- from a quarter basis because the IP business, as we often refer to, is -- can be lumpy. I am very confident, very confident in our portfolio as well as the market position we have. We were very transparent in Q3 that there were a couple of titles that we needed to do some work to accelerate our road map to deliver to customers. And for those titles, we're having ongoing customer -- ongoing engagement with the customers with our revised road map. And I have no doubt that we will capture the opportunity for these couple of titles. The rest of the portfolio is performing incredibly well. So yes, I feel very good that we have derisked the headwinds that we communicated last quarter as we look into '26.

Shelagh Glaser
Chief Financial Officer

And Vivek, what I'd give you with a sort of flavor for the year is IP will be back half loaded. And that's really got to do with the availability of all the HPC titles. So the team is actively working, hitting all the milestones to be able to deliver that, but a few of them are not going to be available until the second part of the year. And so that's really kind of how we built the forecast. As Sassine said, the demand is there from the customers and very solid, but some of our delivery is more back half weighted.

Vivek Arya
BofA Securities, Research Division

Understood. And for my follow-up, what are you assuming for your China sales and on an absolute dollar basis relative to the $814 million or so that you're doing in fiscal '25? And I guess, Sassine, the broader question there is, can your EDA and IP business get back to double-digit growth if you continue to see these China restrictions or if you kind of proactively derisk your business from China engagements?

Sassine Ghazi
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Vivek. So we expect the environment to remain challenging in China. That's why when we look at FY '26 compared to '25, what we are taking into account in our forecast and guide is truly a pragmatic balanced view. We're not assuming that the environment is going to change in the next 1 or 2 quarters to the positive. So therefore, we continue on derisking it in our guide for FY '26.

In terms of the double-digits growth for EDA, we still feel strongly about the opportunity to achieve double digits on the -- from a long-term basis, and it's driven by the complexity and the need for the joint solutions. And as AI evolves from generative to agentic, it will change the workflow, and that's a great opportunity for our industry to find a new way to monetize for the value that we will be delivering to the customers. So again, from a China point of view, we continue on derisking with an assumption of the environment remains the same. And the long term for EDA double digits is something we were holding for that commitment.

The next question is from Joe Vruwink from Baird.

Joseph Vruwink
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I just wanted to stay on the IP topic and given everything that's come up so far in terms of the titles you're seeking availability on midyear and some of the other like strategic elements, the custom IP and potentially changing the business model. That midyear time frame, would you expect to know by then the magnitude of commitments you have in hand so that FY '27, you can maybe make the statement, it will be back to mid-teens growth? I guess my question is mid-teens growth, is that capable for FY '27 based on the pipeline of opportunities you see today?

Sassine Ghazi
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Just let me clarify the midyear. We're not waiting for us to talk to the customer until midyear, we talk to the customer, we have active engagement and even in contract phases with customers based on their road map and based on our road map of delivery. We have established very strong trust with those customers, and they build their road map based on our ability and delivery.

So the other thing I'll point out in terms of IP and in general is the strength of the backlog we're entering the year. Entering the year at $11.4 billion in backlog, that shows the strength of the bookings, the commitment we've had with customers, and it's all about execution and delivery. So Joe, in general, as I keep repeating, my confidence in our IP portfolio is driven by the discussions we're having with customers and the essentialness of what we're delivering here.

Joseph Vruwink
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. I guess I'll next ask about cash flow performance. I look at your adjusted EBIT margins better than 40%. That's nearing the mid-40% goal. Cash flow, I think the guide implies something closer to 20%. So obviously, a lot of upside still to the margin framework there. Just would you expect some of these onetime cash items, restructuring, do those start to settle out of the model as we think forward into the out years?

Shelagh Glaser
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, absolutely, Joe. That's why I called them out because I very much think they're onetime, kind of one-off items. The 2 that I called out was the restructuring. And then obviously, as a part of the OSG, PowerArtist, there was a gain. And so there's the tax on the gain, but those are not recurring. And we're very much focused -- that's a $700 million improvement year-on-year. We're very much focused on driving to that long-term commit of unlevered free cash flow in the mid-30s margin.

Charles Shi from Needham & Company has the next question.

Yu Shi
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Sassine, maybe a question for you, a little bit longer term, a little bit beyond fiscal '26. A lot of the pushbacks I'm hearing from the investment community on Synopsys and actually not just the Synopsys, but the entire EDA industry, entire group is AI is doing very well, but the sector you're in continue to show -- I mean, continue to show deceleration, I would say, since 2022. And it's kind of hard for a lot of folks to understand, given you have all the exposures to all the AI players there, but your business didn't really turn up over the past few years. Is that a monetization problem? And if yes, how do you plan to solve the monetization problem?

Sassine Ghazi
CEO, President & Director

Charles, if I understood your question correctly, when you look at the AI from a semiconductor road map development point of view, it continues on being very strong. If you're a hyperscaler and pretty much every hyperscaler, they're -- they have 3 parts to satisfy their infrastructure build-out. They're buying merchant chips, they're engaged in ASIC and pretty much each one of them, they have their own COT, where the customer own tooling, where they're developing their own semiconductor chips. And the reason they are counting on all 3, it's because of the optimization they need to do for different workloads from a cost and power consumption and the overall ownership of the consumption, it makes sense for them to have a strategy based on these 3 vectors.

From a Synopsys point of view, that's a great opportunity because remember, we don't sell based on volume. We sell based on chip start. So if the chip is coming from a merchant or coming from ASIC or the customer themselves building it, for us and the industry, that's an upside. So we don't see that changing actually, and we see these hyperscalers are doubling down on that strategy.

Yu Shi
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Yes. So Sassine, maybe I should make my question clear because I think all the trends you described, I think that's pretty well understood. But at the same time, folks who are looking at your revenue growth, especially the EDA/IP part, maybe not just the Synopsys, but also Cadence and some of your peers. This whole EDA/IP industry seems to have quite a bit of a deceleration, a growth deceleration over the last couple of years. So this is a kind of in the opposite way of semis, which has seen a very strong AI uplift. So kind of led us to kind of think maybe you -- what the problem you have is not exposure, not that you don't have exposure to AI, but you have a little bit of difficulty to monetize AI. And I think one of the things you mentioned about maybe opening up a third avenue of monetization for IP business, basically for getting into the royalty is the right direction. But we're still kind of curious what do you do about that on the EDA side. It has been a segment that's kind of growing in the single-digit range for a couple of years. It looks like it's going to be another single-digit growth year again.

Sassine Ghazi
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Charles, thank you for clarifying. Absolutely, as an industry, we can do better in capturing more value for the impact we're delivering to our customers. No question. Given the complexity of these chips, what these customers are building, it's not possible without Synopsys and the industry to deliver to the complexity of what we're building. If you look at it from an EDA point of view, the hardware part of EDA is growing at a pace that each year we're saying we're breaking the prior record. And so customers are willing to pay in order to deal with that complexity.

On the EDA software, there is a challenge in terms of the inflection point of monetization. From a Synopsys perspective, every one of these advanced customers are looking for that joint solutions between Ansys and Synopsys. That's an opportunity 1 plus 1 to be greater than 2 as we move to a different workflow for agenetic AI, that's another opportunity for the industry to rethink how do we sell that solution.

From an IP standpoint, the conversations are happening. And that's why when we talked about it 90 days ago, we were talking about it from a position of strength and an opportunity that those customers are expecting and wanting to engage differently. And we're having the right conversations right now to say we're happy to do it, but we need a different monetization upside for these engagements. So good observation, Charles, and I hope my -- the way I'm describing where we've been, where we are, where we're going, it's giving you confidence and shedding some light to it.

And our final question today comes from Ruben Roy from Stifel.

Ruben Roy
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Sassine, you spent a lot of time talking about China, but I do have one question on sort of where you are with China revenue, still meaningful exit rate around 10% of overall revenue. And I'm wondering if you could talk about the mix there and if the headwinds that you're sort of seeing in the pragmatism is across the mix. Meaning, is it core EDA plus IT plus hardware and Ansys? Or are there specific areas that you're more concerned about as you think about this year or even longer term relative to China? And I guess I'm trying to get to, is this a reasonable floor once you get past maybe some of the IP issues that you have there? Or are there other shoes to maybe drop in China as we think about the longer-term model?

Sassine Ghazi
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thank you, Ruben. I want to clarify, and I know Shelagh mentioned it in her prepared remarks, the Synopsys classic had a decline in China. The Ansys portfolio performed fairly well in China because they sell to a very broad market that is not restricted. And we believe a lot of those customers will continue on seeing the value in the legacy Ansys portfolio, and that will continue on growing.

On the classic Synopsys side, what we're facing in China is primarily our inability to sell to our -- to the market that needs the most advanced solution. And you're familiar, not only with entity list, but with technology restrictions. From a Synopsys standpoint, where it impacts us the most is in IP, given the proportion of our business and our leadership in IP, not only in China broadly, but in China that has a fairly big impact on Synopsys.

From EDA in general, as I answered it earlier, we're not losing share to our standard or the peers that you think about. When we're losing share in China are for customers our industry cannot sell to. And therefore, there's an erosion that is happening on the EDA side on customers that we cannot deliver or support due to entity restriction or technology. So we believe we have derisked it in our guide for '26.
