Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Aaron Grey with Alliance Global Partners.

Aaron Grey
Alliance Global Partners, Research Division

Congrats on the strong quarter to finish the fiscal year. First question for me, I want to talk about international. Strong quarter here. I want to talk about how good of a base this might be to build off of. I know you talked about significant growth in fiscal year 2026. How much -- and then also more color in terms of how much of that enhanced cultivation, I believe you said 14,000 kilograms last quarter. Have you started to realize that? Or is that still to come? Because I know that was pegged for international. So any commentary on international growth expectations you expect going forward and then maybe some of the supply-demand dynamics you're seeing within those markets?

Timothy Emberg
President of Organigram Canada

Yes. Maybe -- thanks for the question, Aaron. Maybe I'll kick that off. So yes, we're starting to realize this increased capacity already. We recently increased -- we're looking at about a 14,000 kilograms annual capacity increase with the changes that we just made. That includes our LED light switchover to high-density LED lights turnover time lines on our rooms and some nutrient programs that we've been rolling out along with our seed-based growth. So we have 14,000. We expect to grow further capacity in fiscal '26. I think from a supply and demand perspective, we're well positioned for fiscal '26. Obviously, Germany is growing exponentially right now.

We feel very comfortable in our supply growth that we have right now to be able to shift that into Germany and other international markets. And we are seeing more capacity come online even from a competitive landscape. So we are seeing more volume that's going into these markets and more capacity that's coming online from a competitive perspective. But overall, we are taking a disciplined approach to capacity expansion, and we do believe that our planned increase in fiscal '26 is appropriate in the near term. We are evaluating other options to expand flower capacity further though. So if we need it, we will move as the market continues to grow.

Peter Amirault
Executive Chairman

Tim, is it also fair to add that we've also got some derivative products that will be shipped internationally in fiscal '26?

Timothy Emberg
President of Organigram Canada

Yes. That's a whole other -- we are looking at other categories to expand out as well. Australia, for example, like Germany is really flower right now in oil. So -- but with countries like Australia and other international markets, they're opening different categories up. Vapes, for example, and gummies. So we are -- we've lined up with very strong strategic partners in Australia, and we will be launching branded vapes into the Australian market along with gummies into the Australian market in the coming months. So we're excited about that as well. So it's not just flower as more categories open up, that also gives us other opportunities to grow the business internationally.

Aaron Grey
Alliance Global Partners, Research Division

Appreciate that color. That's helpful. Second question for me, just on the gross margin. I know you talked about the expectation for it to be better than 2025, 35%. So just want to get some more color given the strong 4Q of 38%. Were there some one-offs in 4Q that could moderate during 2026? Or is it fair to say that there might be some conservatism maybe within the gross margin improvements going forward? And I just want to clarify that does not include any further enhancement once you receive the EU-GMP.

Greg Guyatt
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Aaron. Yes, the 38% that we had in Q4 was obviously something we're very happy with. It is a 100 basis point improvement over the same period last year. So going into fiscal 2026, we're expecting that to continue improving. I would say Q1 is traditionally not our strongest quarter from a seasonality perspective. So we expect less scale to benefit from in Q1. But over the course of the year, we expect a positive trend in gross margin, really driven by the operational improvements that Tim talked about. We've been able to pretty significantly increase our capacity without making major capital investments and physical changes to the facility.

And all of that is really bringing down our cost per gram, which is driving those margin improvements. Also, we mentioned the Motif acquisition. We're starting to realize the synergies from that. That's a further improvement to adjusted gross margin. And then finally, when we do eventually get our EU-GMP, which we're waiting on patiently, that's going to have another positive as well because that will drive further margin on our international business. So overall, I think last year or last quarter, I guided towards margins approaching the 40% range, and that still holds. We're expecting margins to continue to grow over the course of the next year.

Peter Amirault
Executive Chairman

And just one quick comment. It's Peter. I would say the 38%, we're happy with, but we're not satisfied. We think there's more.

Timothy Emberg
President of Organigram Canada

Yes. Another lever that we have is from the commercial side of the business. Obviously, we're looking at SKU rationalization and emphasizing more on our high-margin categories, which is a big focus for us, but also taking price when earned. We took 2 different price points -- price increases in fiscal '25, and we just took another one early fiscal '26. Now if you look at the overall category from a pricing perspective, price compression is only really impacting AIOs or all-in-one vapes over the past year. We've seen an increase in the ASP pricing on flower over the past year as there's this balance between supply and demand in the Canadian market and LPs have taken price, and we're one of them. So I think that definitely helps to drive margins as well.

Aaron Grey
Alliance Global Partners, Research Division

Okay. That's great to hear. I appreciate the color. I'll go and get back in the queue.

Your next question comes from the line of Brenna Cunnington with ATB Capital Markets.

Brenna Cunnington
ATB Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. Just continuing on the line of thought with the Motif synergies materializing and approaching 40% margins next year, roughly how much of this margin improvement do you think would be from further synergies from Motif versus cultivation improvements and other improvements in just general fundamentals?

Greg Guyatt
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I think when you look at the scale of our Moncton facility and the cultivation, that's going to drive the majority of the margin improvement that we're seeing. I mean, look, we've already recognized a fairly significant amount of Motif synergies in the back half of last year. We do expect it to continue. But I'd say more of the synergies are going to come from operational improvements in Moncton independent from the acquisition. Just the cost per gram itself is coming down, and that just drives a significant amount of margin improvement.

Brenna Cunnington
ATB Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Got you. And then, yes, we also noticed that the yield per plant improved in the last quarter as well. So that's good to see. And then our second question is just regarding CapEx plans. You're sitting on a decent amount of cash, specifically with the restricted cash that's preserved for investment. Could you just run us through again some of the plans for investments in the next year?

Greg Guyatt
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So last year, we spent -- invested a pretty significant amount into the business of around $17 million. For fiscal 2026, we expect that to be significantly lower, less than $10 million. We're obviously always evaluating new opportunities for investment in the facilities. But right [Technical Difficulty] foundation of what we have today, along with just sort of sustaining capital expenditures to keep advancing the business. Last year, we did look at doing an expansion in Moncton. We ultimately put that on hold because we were able to achieve those objectives through process improvement and through the LED light project. So I'd say CapEx plans are modest for the next year, but it's something we'll continue to evaluate as opportunities come up.

Brenna Cunnington
ATB Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. Perfect. Those are my questions. I'll hand it back.

That concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Tim Emberg for closing remarks.

Timothy Emberg
President of Organigram Canada

Thank you. Well, listen, I just want to thank everybody for your time today. Obviously, we're extremely excited of the quarter that we just had in the year we just had. We're pumped for fiscal '26 as we feel we're going to continue to take that momentum to drive growth, both from a domestic side and the international side. I'd like to take a moment to wish you all a very happy holiday season as we're getting close to the holidays now. And we look forward to relooping in February for our Q1 results. So thank you.

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.
