[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Sean Dodge with BMO Capital Markets.

Sean Dodge
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Congratulations on the quarter and on closing the acquisition. Chaim, you mentioned the new emerging solution areas that will help to continue driving higher revenue per AHSC. On AccessOne, maybe just anything more you can share on the growth potential for that business, specifically over the next couple of years and how you can accelerate it?

And how much room is left to continue expanding within their existing base? And then maybe anything that you need to kind of change about that before you can start cross-selling it into the legacy Phreesia base? When does that become an opportunity?

Chaim Indig
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

So we're really excited to be able to take this to some of our base clients. Right now, the product is -- is really not suited for the vast majority of our clients. So it will need some work and investment before we can take it to the vast majority of our base just because of the facility. And Balaji you can answer more questions about that.

But Look, we think that we plan on investing in go-to market. And I think it's a really strong product offering that has for years been underinvested in go-to-market. And some of those had to do with the dynamics of the market and the company itself. And we expect over the next couple of quarters to start investing into its go-to-market motion. And both for new clients and existing clients.

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer

And Sean, I'll just add that investment that Chaim talking about that's baked into our outlook for 2027. And a lot of that is just resources we have within the company. And obviously, the ones that are coming over with the acquisition or have come over with the acquisition. And then just around growth, I mean, the question itself. I think this is the largest acquisition we've done -- this is something we think over multi-years will contribute a lot.

We acquired it with that thesis. We wouldn't read too much into what's implied in the '27 guidance in revenue. It's just if you do an acquisition, you closed in November, it's the responsible thing to do is just set the bar, where we have, and we have very high expectations for it.

And our next question comes from the line of Scott Schoenhaus with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Scott Schoenhaus
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I guess 1 for Balaji really quickly and then 1 for the team. But first on the financing Balaji, you mentioned you're going to refinance or take on a new loan. Can you maybe provide more color there on what you're seeing in the marketplace and what you expect?

And then maybe for Haym and Balaji, this mid-single-digit AHSC growth for next year. Maybe talk about your go-to-market strategy in terms of what is -- what products -- what your core products are you going to market to drive that growth? And then how do you think about that growth holistically with this new marketing opportunity.

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer

Okay. I'll start on the financing. So we are already pretty actively looking at replacing the bridge, and we just wanted to be positioned to move really quickly on the acquisition, but moving quickly to have something long term in place, and you should be hearing about that in the next few months. In terms of the appetite out there, there's a lot of demand to do something with us.

I think we were very intentional about doing an acquisition of this size and financing it this way for a long time based on our free cash flow and our EBITDA. So we feel pretty good about all that. Chaim, you want to add...

Chaim Indig
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. And then from a go-to-market motion, look, we -- they have 2 very different go-to-market teams on the provider side we're seeing still a lot of demand for intake and a lot of our new AI offerings are driving a lot of uptick in inbound very specifically our voice AI workflows and applications. It's a new modality on the same platform. So we're seeing a lot of demand for it.

And then on our -- the Network Solutions side, Patient Connect has been very successful, and we expect that to be continued growth, but some of the newer offerings such as post-script engagement, and now the interest we've been getting in our HCP offering has been really exciting.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Jailendra Singh with Truist Securities.

Jailendra Singh
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Thanks for all the color on the fiscal '27 outlook. If I got my math right, your fiscal '27 revenue guidance implies around 8% to 10% core organic growth number I know you guys have talked about double-digit core growth, so that would be at the high end of that guide.

Can you share some color around how you're thinking of core growth in 3 business at, at least directionally compared to your expectation of fiscal '26 I was more focused on network solution because are you still in the middle selling season, how much visibility do you have, what level of question you're building in? Just give us some flavor around that and what is built in that 8% to 10% number.

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. And so just philosophically, as you know, for several years, we provide an outlook for the next fiscal year before the current 1 is even over. I think we've gotten good feedback about that. And what that requires us to do is make a lot of assumptions around things like the selling season while they're still going on.

So I think even outside of that, still a couple of weeks left here, Jailendra, I think we could comfortably say that we're in a similar situation we were last year at this time. And if you think about the growth in the business outside of what we've told you is coming from AccessOne, network solutions would be growing the fastest.

And I think payment processing, you could expect to grow second and subscription third. And I think what you should take away from that is A lot of the commentary Chaim had about our HCP products. And earlier in the year, we talked about post-script engagement and appointment readiness. We expect to monetize a lot of the products for providers increasingly in Network Solutions. So that we should take away.

Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.

Brian Tanquilut
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Maybe Balaji, just as I think about margins, obviously, strong margin performance in the quarter. You've done a good job there. So -- as I look at the guidance for next year, showing about 450 bps of margin expansion. How should I think about the drivers of that and just the sustainability of kind of like squeezing margins here and there over the next few years?

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I mean, I think the team has done an outstanding job of being very good stewards of capital. This is something we really prioritized in the company for the last several years. I think you're comparing year-over-year. I mean we've already hit a pretty good margin here in the third quarter we just released.

I think what we want to balance is growth and margin. Your takeaway should be, we want to always do better than we say in terms of growth and always get better in terms of margin. So I think that outlook sort of reflects the opportunity to do both. I think G&A, we've always talked about G&A is generally an area we can get a lot of leverage on based on the investments we've made there. But I think we'll continue to invest in sales and marketing and R&D so long as there's growth to support it.

And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair.

Ryan Daniels
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

I wanted to dig a little bit more into the new HCP marketing initiative. And I'm curious, I guess, twofold. 1, have you actively started to sell that for the 2026 season? And kind of what's been the reception from pharma clients and then second, when you think about that, are you seeing or do you anticipate that it will be all incremental dollars? Or do you think any of your kind of D2C dollars from the pharma companies could shift into HCP such that's not 100% incremental?

Chaim Indig
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

So yes, we have started for select clients, allowing them to start piloting the offering in the new year. So we have been selling it for certain key clients. And there has been a lot of demand, and we expect to start treating those programs on in the new fiscal year.

And then in terms of is it incremental dollars we do think it is, generally speaking, DGC budgets and HCP budgets are very different. So we believe this is a -- and I think we sort of -- we've been out there in the market explaining to some of our holders that this is new TAM.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Ryan MacDonald with Needham & Company.

Ryan MacDonald
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Balaji, maybe for you, just wanted to ask about the updated '26 guidance. I know you called out $7.5 million of -- in fourth quarter from AccessOne, yes, we've only increased the guidance range at the midpoint by about $3 million -- is there sort of a $4.5 million hole that we're refilling here?

Or anything we should be concerned about, I guess, within the core subscription or network solutions business. And how is that sort of impacting your outlook of either of those segments kind of heading into '27?

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer

I was trying to do the math, Ryan, that you just did. Are you -- maybe just repeat that. I couldn't figure out the $4 million that you said.

Ryan MacDonald
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Yes. So our prior guidance range was $472 million to $482 million. So we're taking a $477 million midpoint -- now the midpoint goes to $480 million in the updated guidance. And so up by $3 million at the midpoint, but you've got a $7.5 million revenue contribution from AccessOne. That wasn't in the prior guidance. So just wondering sort of what's the -- I guess, the difference there on the adding $7.5 million, but only increasing the guide by about $3 million at the midpoint.

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer

Correct. Okay. Got it. That's helpful. yes, that's -- a lot of that is just being a bit more measured around network solutions. I don't think it's a surprise probably to anyone on this call, that there's a lot of decisions and a lot of fluidity out there, and we're in the selling season.

So just given where we are, I think we wanted to be a bit more measured on network solutions, if you had to allocate that $4 million somewhere we say it's mostly there. And by the way, there's a lot of timing and visibility that we'll get, but I don't think it's anything to read into about next year.

And our next question comes from the line of Richard Close with Canaccord Genuity.

Richard Close
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

Congratulations on the acquisition in the quarter. Just curious if you guys could talk a little bit more about AccessOne, the funded and unfunded, how we think about like the demand in various products or those offerings? And then just like how you expect any type of seasonality in that business in terms of selling new customers and et cetera?

Chaim Indig
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

So I'll give you -- Richard, what you're bringing up is something we've really liked about this platform is the flexibility they have in having a variety of different ways to service the needs of their client. We actually found it to be the most -- there's a couple of different offerings in the space. And when we looked at them, what we found about AccessOne was most advanced technology with by far the most scale and flexibility. So in all of our experience in working with health care clients is they want different things based on their needs.

And with the AccessOne portfolio, whether it's funding or partial funding or full funding, the platform gives us the flexibility to meet them, where they need that help. And we feel like it's -- gives us the flexibility to have a multitude of offerings to help them increase their cash flow, specifically cut the days outstanding. We expect over the next couple of years to learn a lot about each offering to resonate, which sets of clients. And I'm sure we'll be back talking about that as we see growing the marketplace, and we're pretty excited about it.

And as far as seasonality measured, I think our go-to-market will probably be similar to how we position ourselves with providers. So from that motion, I don't think you should see anything different. However, we'll learn this as we go, Richard. But I think you could see more chunkiness in terms of how this revenue drops and when we do expand or land a new client, and we'll obviously communicate that as that happens, which we expect it to.

And our next question comes from the line of Daniel Grosslight with Citi.

Daniel Grosslight
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Balaji, I wanted to go back to the commentary you made around the fluidity in the network solution selling season this year. Is any of that due to just unknowns around how DTC advertising large is going to develop given just some of the political issues around that? And what gives you confidence that this fluidity is just really going to happen in fiscal '26 and what really impact fiscal '27?

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks, Daniel. So a couple of points there. First of all, yes, it is around the DTC topic, and I think that's why we're being a bit more measured. I think 1 earlier comment we made was as we sit here today on December 8, we're in a similar place we were last year at this time, but the numbers get bigger and the dollars are bigger. So that's 1 thing to consider.

And then as far as just our positioning, and I think we've been talking about this in the past, when you think about our product and how we lead with permission and the value we bring to our life sciences clients and the return on value they see from that, we think we're very well positioned long term with the commentary and regulatory information that's come out of the administration so far.

In fact, we agree with a fair amount of that. So we think that's good and we think we're on the right side of where they're trying to go. But that said, we've got to get through the next several weeks to have a little more visibility. So that's why we made the comments we did.

And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Garro with Stephens.

Jeffrey Garro
Stephens Inc., Research Division

I want to go back to the HCP opportunity and maybe ask about MediFind a little bit more specifically. We saw a recent partnership announcement between 2 provider directories that, to some extent, compete with each other and to some extent, compete with MediFind. So I was hoping you could update us on MediFind's tractions and Phreesia MediFind's competitive advantages from offering an integrated platform connecting providers with scheduling and other patient engagement capabilities.

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer

Jeff, we're curious what partnership you're talking about -- do you mind sharing it because I don't think we're familiar with it.

Jeffrey Garro
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Health grades is going to be using Zocdoc's scheduling capabilities.

Chaim Indig
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Got it. Got it.

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer

We weren't aware of that. And we don't see it as being very competitive in the marketplace. What we've heard from a lot of specialists is that they're not in need of paying for leads -- and that's an impact, a lot of them think that it's just unethical and wrong. And so what our view on that has been for some time, is how do we help the right patients find the right doctors, not just the doctors that are willing to pay to get product placement in a directory.

And so we've really focused our effort on driving and becoming the go-to source for the top specialists to be found by providers. And what we're pretty excited about is that by building it into the Phreesia platform, we're seeing just a phenomenal amount of uptick in volume usage, and we expect to keep investing heavily into this platform for some period of time.

And our next question comes from the line of John Ransom with Raymond James.

John Ransom
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Just looking at the Q3 EBITDA outperformance and the guide for 2027, what would you say because the jump in -- I know there's seasonality in payroll taxes, but the jumping all point seems a bit stronger than the implied guide. So any comments there other than the $900,000 you mentioned?

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So there's -- well, there's 2 items, John, there's the payroll taxes that our bad guy in Q4 just seasonality. And then we had that $900,000 good guy in Q3. So I think if you sort of have to use both of those, but I think it implies a little bit of improvement. But I think to the earlier comment I think question we had, we're certainly trying to leave ourselves some room to continue to perform there. And we expect that margin to get better. Is that helpful?

John Ransom
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

And marketing spend was the big variance in our model. So maybe in your guide, what are you contemplating for year-over-year marketing spend growth?

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer

I think you should expect marketing dollars to go up. I think we've got, obviously, a lot of growth initiatives that Chaim spoke about earlier. So as a dollar amount, I think you should expect marketing dollars to go up.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Jessica Tassan with Piper Sandler.

Jessica Tassan
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

And congrats on the close of AccessOne. Can you all elaborate a little bit on how PhreesiaOnCall allows you to enter the provider workflow and surface educational content to the HCP just kind of mechanically, how does that work? And then can you just remind us how much of Network Solutions revenue typically books ahead of the start of the calendar year versus upsold or cross-sold intra-year and whether FY '26 is tracking consistent with historical experience?

Chaim Indig
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

So we are testing different types of ad formats. And obviously, it's still early into PhreesiaOnCall. And so there will be ads in certain parts of the product where they're not creating any obtrusive workflow for the provider. Is just in the natural act of using the product. So we're in the process of testing those with our customers now in pilot.

So I think it's the early days are early, Jeff. And -- but on the early tests that we have seen, we feel pretty confident they'll be very effective.

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer

And then yes, I mean just we typically enter a calendar year because remember, a lot of those clients in the Network Solutions revenue are upper in the calendar year. So when you typing enter calendar year with about 60% to 70% visibility.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird.

Joseph Vruwink
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Maybe a super quick answer. But going back to Jailendra's question earlier, he was asking about organic growth in FY '27. And Balaji, you mentioned network fastest payment second, subscription third I just wanted to clarify if that's the organic rank ordering because I guess it's not intuitive to me why payments would be growing faster than subs next year.

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer

Correct. Jailendra's question was specifically excluding AccessOne, which is why we answered it that way. I haven't done the math here, but I think it would either be neck and neck or payments would be faster with AccessOne. I can follow up with you later, but that was specifically about organic.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Clark Wright with D.A. Davidson.

Clark Wright
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

A lot of might have been answered, but wanted to real quick touch on if you can help us really understand the assumptions behind the fiscal 2027 top line outlook and the mix that you're seeing right now between the growth in account of AHSCs versus the total revenue per AHSC? And if that -- the assumptions you've made includes AccessOne with those figures?

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, it does. And I think, again, short cut math here is there's -- we use this average convention in the AHSC. So it's approximately 80, and we're still just closing November for AccessOne. If it's about 80 for a year, we're saying about 15 of it will fall into our fiscal '26. So really about 65 will fall into fiscal '27.

So that's about 1 point of growth. So when we put in our letter mid-single-digit AHSC growth, you could say about 1 point contribution coming from AccessOne in there.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jailendra Singh with Truist Securities.

Jailendra Singh
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

I'm curious with shares trading at these valuation levels. What are your thoughts on returning shareholders some value via share buyback program and if that would even be a consideration in light of all the investment opportunities you are focused on?

Chaim Indig
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

It would absolutely be a consideration. I think we did get approval to pursue that last year or earlier this fiscal year, actually. And I think now with this debt facility in place for AccessOne, we think the best use of free cash flow is to retire that debt. But -- and we also have other areas we want to invest in.

But Jailendra has absolutely been part of our thinking for several years now to try to take advantage of market dislocation. Obviously, right now, priority is the debt, but it's definitely 1 of our priorities.

With no additional questions, I will now turn the conference back over to Chaim Indig for closing remarks.
