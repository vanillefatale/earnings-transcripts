Question-and-Answer Session

Matthew Korn
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, Steve. We will now proceed with the question-and-answer session. Now to ensure that we maximize everyone's opportunity to participate, we ask that you please limit yourselves to 1 and only 1 question. Sarah, with that, we're ready to begin.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS.

Thomas Wadewitz
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Great. Just I guess one fine point on the OR improvement, if you could tell us what the base OR is in '25, kind of just like what's included. But I guess the real question, if you will, how do you think about pricing and price/cost spread? I think, Steve, focus on price and productivity are kind of 2 hallmarks of your approach. How do you think about the opportunity to have some traction on the price initiatives and see pricing above cost inflation in 2026?

Kevin Boone
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Tom, on the base, the starting point for 2025 is obviously ex the charge that we took on goodwill. So that's the starting point that we have in the adjusted number that we disclosed.

Stephen Angel
CEO, President & Director

And on your questions on price and productivity. So as we think about price, I mean, certainly, you would like to be able to cover the cost of inflation in any given year and actually do better than that. In terms of kind of where we are in the pricing initiatives, Maryclare has taken the ball on that and has already put some new structures in place that I think are definitely going to help in terms of our price yield. As we look at what we have in the plan for 2026 versus 2025, price yield will be higher in 2026 over 2025 than it was in 2025 over 2024. So we're making progress, I think, on the pricing front. It will be a bit slow going, but I think we'll continue to make progress as we work harder on the whole price management equation.

And in terms of these contracts have a roll off in certain time frames that would probably take until about this time next year before we had a chance to touch every contract and stress test, if you will, in terms of what the right price is versus the value we're bringing to that customer.

The next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan.

Brian Ossenbeck
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So maybe one for Kevin. In the 200 to 300 basis point guidance for improvement, can you give us some qualification, how much of that you think is already baked in based on some of the onetime items or the things you know are rolling off? And sort of what are you expecting for inflation within that guide? Because if you look at the AII-LF Index, for example, that's starting to pick up a bit here. So maybe give us a little bit more color in terms of the building blocks there and sort of what's already spoken for and what are the assumptions underlying the rest of it?

Kevin Boone
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. No, when you look at some of the unique charges that occurred in 2025 between the severance, the technology write-off that we disclosed as well as some of the costs related to the Blue Ridge and Howard Street Tunnel, you could roughly assume those are about $150 million. What we're doing, what our guidance implies is a much greater initiative around productivity and a big focus across the organization to drive that. And so you'll see our productivity numbers, if you do the math, have a fairly significant increase and step up.

When we think about what's happening on the inflation side on our labor side, that's pretty self-explanatory on the union side. The industry has obviously embedded labor inflation. Next year, you'll see another wage increase in the 3.75% range. We're also experiencing a little bit of more health care inflation going into '26 versus '25. So I would say on the labor side, that's pretty consistent with what we saw last year, maybe a little bit higher than last year. And then on the nonlabor side, a lot of efforts by the procurement team and others to drive that a little bit lower. So we expect a little bit lower inflation on the nonlabor side. So overall, I would look at inflation probably being in that 3% to 3.5% range.

The next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.

Scott Group
Wolfe Research, LLC

The low single-digit revenue growth for the year, any just sort of rough thoughts on volume versus yield in that? And then maybe, Steve, just bigger picture, like the guide this year, I guess, implies like a [ 64 to 65 ] OR. Now that you've been here a few months, do you have a feel for like what you think the longer-term operating ratio should be? Should this be a sub-60 OR railroad in the next few years? Or not -- is that -- I don't know how should we think about that?

Maryclare Kenney

Scott, this is Maryclare. I'll take the first part. So I think as we think about next year, we're looking at modest volume growth going into the year. I covered some of the macro environment that we're seeing out there. And while we're optimistic about certain areas and we see growth opportunities in places like intermodal, places where you see infrastructure investment like our minerals markets. And I think there's some potential on the domestic utility side when you think about the need for power generation as well as natural gas prices are, those are kind of more positives for us.

But then as I talked about, when you look at more of the industrial economy, we still see a lot of headwinds out there. So at this point, we'd say really modest volume growth next year.

Stephen Angel
CEO, President & Director

Yes. And on the -- I'll just talk in terms of operating margin percent. Look, we want to expand it every year. And if we're doing the right things on price management and productivity, we will be able to do that. And I have confidence in this team. I have confidence in our ability to build solid productivity programs to be able to grow operating margin a certain percent every year, and I could give you a number now, but I think I'll wait and talk about that later.

But the objective is best-in-class performance. And you know what that is with respect to operating margin. I know what that is. I have confidence we can get there. The question is over what time frame, we'll make progress every year. What I would like to do, I mean, we have a very solid plan, as Kevin described, and we put a ton of time into building this plan for the environment that we're facing and to make sure we could deliver an outcome that we would be proud of.

So that's where we are. But what I would like to see over the course of time is how well we can execute to those plans. I have confidence we can, but I'd like to experience that a few quarters, if you will, just so I can get grounded and confident in our ability to build, I'll call it, sustainable productivity over time. And I think we can do that, but give me a little time to get more confident in our ability to do that.

The next question comes from Ariel Rosa with Citigroup.

Ariel Rosa
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

So we're looking at -- I apologize because this is a little bit short term, but we're looking at potentially a pretty nasty storm coming up. Not too long ago, we saw CSX's network face a pretty big setback given some storms. I'm curious, maybe Mike is the best one to answer this question. Just how are you preparing for the storm? And how do we get confidence? Maybe it's an opportunity to talk about kind of how you're running the network differently now versus, say, 12 to 18 months ago. But what are the risks that these types of events could present setbacks? And how do we get comfortable that this isn't going to be a big obstacle in Q1?

Michael Cory
Executive VP & COO

Sure. Thanks for the question, Ariel. As we've said, like the network is going into this in much better condition than last year when we started facing storms. So just to give you just a view of what we see, we're going to see ice on our southern portion of our network basically going from Nashville right across through Alabama through Georgia. And then in the middle section of our network, we're going to experience or we see right now from the weather reports, we're going to experience heavy snow right from Indiana through Kentucky, right across PA, Western Maryland, Virginia, all the way up the I-95.

So in terms of precautions, here's some real detail. I mean we're going to have senior coverage right around the clock in all of our key areas, including our network center, -- we've got -- we've gone over from snow clearing to tree clearing, generators, everything that we need in each location, each facility that we see the storm coming through. We've modified our operating plan, working with our customers, notifying them because they're going to have the same conditions that really assets for us right now are going to be the most crucial thing that we protect.

At the same time, we expect to see power outages, highway closures. We're going to see cold right after that. So I do not see us coming out of this probably for a few days. If we get it Sunday, we're looking at midweek to recover. But I'm very confident, especially with the condition that we're going in, that we will come through this with no issues. This is not going to lead us into 4 months of trouble like it did the year before. Even if there is some consecutiveness to it, we have everything in place. And what we learned last year, we're putting into effect throughout the beginning and right through this storm.

The next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.

Brandon Oglenski
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And I guess, Mike, it's not shocking that it snows in January. So I'd ask maybe more importantly, like how are you approaching operations differently this year, especially with like new leadership concepts at the company? How do you get back to those best-in-class metrics that the railroad had 3 or 4 years ago?

Michael Cory
Executive VP & COO

Yes. No, thanks for the question. I think you can see by the metrics we have now, we're running as good as we have 3 or 4 years ago. But really, I mean, it's a focus on asset utilization. It's a focus on oversight and to the key measures that we look at every day. Really, that's what we've done. What we learned through that exercise was to make sure that we take action as soon as we can on the issues that are preventing us from being fluid. And that's from making sure that we don't bring equipment in when we shouldn't. It's making sure we have our excess equipment in places to be able to respond to issues we have.

And that's generally what we did to come out of the second quarter issue -- first and second quarter issues we've had. But I don't see us really failing on the storm coming up. I appreciate your concern, but we're ready for it. And again, I see us coming through it very well.

Operator

The next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.

Ken Hoexter
BofA Securities, Research Division

So Kevin, it sounds like a lot of programs. I think you mentioned 100 different ones. But just so we don't get lost in kind of minutia, can you maybe talk dollar amounts for buckets so we can, I don't know, track something. Is there workforce optimization or a headcount target? Anything from Mike Cory on the op savings? And Kevin, you mentioned nonlabor spending. Maybe you could just maybe parse that out a little bit. So -- because if we've got very low volume growth, very low pricing growth, how do we get that 200 to 300 margin basis points? I guess you take out maybe 100 basis points or so from the $100 million that you spent this year. But if you can bucket size some of that stuff to help us walk through and what to expect.

Kevin Boone
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. When you look at the majority of the productivity, that you obviously can solve for after the $150 million that I pointed out that naturally just comes out, that won't repeat in 2026. It's very, very highly focused on the labor line and the PS&O line. And so a lot of activity in those 2 areas, I would say, largely equally divided. You'll probably see on an absolute basis, an absolute dollar basis, more come out of the PS&O line because you're going to have less inflation, core inflation in that line versus the labor, which I talked about a little bit earlier, given, obviously, our union labor contracts and what we're seeing on the medical side on that area. But those are the areas. We're certainly focused on driving cost improvement across the line items. Depreciation, more or less, will be in the flat range as we pointed out.

And then certainly some areas of improvement. Mike will always tell you on the fuel side, we're looking for every opportunity to continue to get more fuel efficient. And then on the rent side, there's some opportunity as we run better, certainly from a car hire and other areas that we expect to drive improvement there, too.

So the good news is a diversified portfolio of opportunities. I guess the bad news on that side is we've got to stay very, very focused across all these areas to make sure that we're capitalizing on those. And my full expectation as we move into -- later into this month in February and March, we're going to come up with an additional list that will obviously, hopefully, drive further improvement in the back half of the year and then create some opportunities as we move into 2027.

The next question comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies.

Stephanie Benjamin Moore
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I think I would be a bit remiss not to ask at least about the major merger that is underway for this industry. If you could maybe talk about how you are positioning the company in the wake of what could be a pretty transformational deal. So in the near term, while it's under review, what are the opportunities that you all can take advantage of?

And then, of course, I'm sure you're also having to somewhat scenario analyze what would be like if the deal is approved. And in that way, what is the strategy for CSX as kind of this whole East Coast merger -- East Coast Rail?

Stephen Angel
CEO, President & Director

[indiscernible] made a call, it took 3 years before the final restriction was lifted. So for 3 years, we were kind of in deal purgatory. And what you have to do is make sure that you're running the business the best your ability every day. And that's kind of the key in this process. I don't know what conditions are going to be required for approval. That remains to be seen. I think this is a long process, and we'll find out what that is. And then when you get to the end of that, the -- if the merger is approved, you still have to execute.

So I think it's a long process. As I said, there are going to be opportunities we can take advantage of. We see some today that we're taking advantage of. Whatever risks are out there, we'll certainly manage those. We'll mitigate those. We'll have plans for those. As the time comes forward for us to make our case to the appropriate authorities, we'll certainly be prepared to do that. And then the focus is just making sure that we can be as competitive as we can be.

But at the end of the day, we can create value by running CSX better every day. So you can set the merger aside, we're going to manage that. We're going to work through that. We're going to have many, many quarters to talk about that probably. But what we know we can do now is run this company better every day, and we feel really good about our ability to do that.

The next question comes from Jonathan Chappell with Evercore ISI.

Jonathan Chappell
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Kevin, maybe Maryclare, can you just help us a little bit with coal RPU? It feels like the way that we're calculating it now is a little bit different than the last several years. And what are you thinking about is baked into that revenue growth? Do we see -- and this is from both a 1Q and a full year perspective. Is it kind of stabilized from this 4Q exit rate? Or is there some improvement baked into what's a very important yield line item?

Maryclare Kenney

Yes. So it's Maryclare. I'd say as we think about RPU going forward, there's always a mix element that comes into our business. And so as I think about going into 2026, I talked about some of the markets that we feel a little bit better about as well as ones that we see more risk. And so intermodal, we feel good about. When you think about some of our merchandise side of the business, we see some impacts there of probably stronger growth in some of our lower RPU business like minerals and fertilizers and more softness in some of our higher RPU business when you think about our Forest Products business or our chemicals business, talk a little bit more about next year. We've got overlaps that we saw closures over the course of 2025, quite a few of that in our Forest Products line of business.

We see auto down next year from a North American light vehicle production perspective. And we also have a large plant on our network that will be down over the course of next year. So that will certainly impact where we see volume growth versus decline, and that comes into play. I would tell you, Steve spoke earlier about how we're thinking about pricing. We've had a lot of conversations there. We've looked at our processes and controls, and Mike is delivering a really good service product right now and customers value that. And so we're going to take that into account as we think about going forward. And you also know there's a portion of our business that we can touch every year. So that will impact from a timing perspective.

Kevin Boone
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And I'll just add on the coal RPU, just as a headline, we went through a year where we're lapping some pretty difficult comps, and that will be largely -- we'll be through that by the first quarter on that side. So we'll see a lot more stable, maybe slightly down. But again, that to Maryclare's point, it's a lot about mix. And obviously, with a stronger Southern utility demand, that is helpful as well given the length of haul.

Operator

The next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo.

Christian Wetherbee
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Maybe I want to come back to a question I was asked earlier in the call and maybe think about it a little bit differently. I guess, Steve, you talked about best-in-class. And when you think about it from a margin perspective, we kind of know where the benchmarks are. CSX was there probably 5 or 6 years ago for a few years. And I know things are different, mix is different. There are some other dynamics in the market relative to them.

But I guess as you've been there for 3-plus months now and had a chance to kind of think about the business, is there anything meaningful that you see that would sort of prevent the ability to get back to those levels, whether you think about sort of the different customer mix, how things are changing, if there's anything from a network perspective we should be thinking about? I get the productivity and you have to kind of get some reps in before you feel comfortable with how that can be sustainable. But anything sort of maybe insurmountable that you see right off the bat?

Stephen Angel
CEO, President & Director

I mean, in an answer, no, I don't see anything insurmountable. And it's not like I'm sitting here thinking that we're going to go back to the heydays of coal, and that's how we're going to accomplish it. That's not what I'm thinking. I'm thinking about basically take the mix we got and through some of the strong initiatives that Maryclare talked about earlier, finding some growth through our own actions. Obviously, any time you get a little help from the economy, that would certainly help a great deal towards moving those operating margins up faster.

But I really don't sit here and think I need to have a lot of help from the economy. I think our own growth initiatives do a better job on price management, and working the productivity equation very hard. And both Mike and Kevin have talked about certain actions that they've taken. But I can lay out something that says we should be able to get there. But again, I want to see the kind of proof in the pudding, and I think that will happen. But that's kind of how I think about it.

Operator

The next question comes from Jason Seidl with TD Cowen.

Jason Seidl
TD Cowen, Research Division

Maryclare, I guess this is going to be one for you. If we're going to go back to the coal side, but I want a clarification first. I think you said it was -- you were calling for muted growth and then you said next year. I'm assuming you were talking '26 and not '27?

Maryclare Kenney

Yes, '26, sorry.

Jason Seidl
TD Cowen, Research Division

Okay. Not a problem. I've done that a bunch of times already this year. I wanted to just ask a question, given this storm and some of the impacts that we've seen at least over the last 2 days with natural gas futures, -- just how long do natural gas prices have to stay elevated until we see a flow-through on the volume side? And what's sort of the best way to monitor that?

Maryclare Kenney

Yes. Thanks, Jason. I would say, as I think about the coal side, both with greater power demand that we're seeing here and the increase in the natural gas prices, certainly supported recently about this upcoming storm. We feel good about the volume demand on the domestic utility side. I would say one of the things that we're watching here, though, is there were some plant closures that were supposed to start happening this year. We expect those will get delayed. But for how long, that's a little bit uncertain. I think there's going to be more demand and more opportunity for us. I think the piece we'll have to watch is how much can actually be supported by the producers going forward.

Operator

The next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.

Ravi Shanker
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Steve, it's understandable that you pulled the long-term guidance given what macro has done in the last couple of years. But is that still the right template to think about earnings growth in the long term when macro is normal? Or do you think something has changed with the business where it could be better or worse than that initial guidance?

Stephen Angel
CEO, President & Director

No, I don't think anything has changed in the business where we can't come back and lay out a longer-term guidance or a longer-term algorithm. I don't see anything that's fundamentally changed the business that would prevent us from doing that. It's just caution on my part that I want to make sure that we can execute the plans in front of us before we start talking about a longer-term picture. But I'm not sitting here thinking that we need to get away from that any kind of longer-term guidance because there's something fundamentally wrong in the business. I don't see that.

Operator

The next question comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.

Jordan Alliger
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Just sort of curious, can you maybe talk a little bit more about the double stack opportunity, perhaps sort of update, if anything, on the sizing. And I know you said people are putting bids out for the second quarter. Any additional sense for how we should think about the timing of how that could ramp into your business in order of magnitude?

Maryclare Kenney

Yes. Thank you. So I'd tell you, we're really excited about Howard Street Tunnel. I've been here 14 years and excited to see it come to fruition. And there's a couple of opportunities there. One, we're adding new connectivity from the Southeast up into the Northeast. And so we've announced new lanes of service. But it's also going to improve our service product from Chicago too and from Baltimore. It's also enabled us to allow efficient double-stack service from the West Coast all the way through to Baltimore versus having to do a Riverside Crosstown in Chicago.

So we're excited about the opportunities that are out there. We're talking to our customers today, both channel partners and shippers. But what I would tell you is based on past experience, it typically takes a couple of bid cycles to really for customers to kind of see the opportunity and convert more business. So we expect to see growth this year and going into the future, I would say, both on our domestic and in the future on the international side of the business as well.

Operator

The next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital.

Walter Spracklin
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I wanted to come back to the revenue growth profile of low single digit. I know whenever I think about pricing in the rail industry, I kind of consider it in the 3.5% area, and then you do assume some volume growth, it would seem. So just curious, is there a mix effect at play here where we should build in some negative mix? Or are we seeing that core pricing number that's typically north of 3%, somewhere below 3%? I know, Maryclare, you flagged truck pricing. I don't know if that's -- I mean, truck pricing is catching a bit here. So I'm just curious as to how the -- you decompose the revenue growth versus what you would have seen typically in the past?

Maryclare Kenney

Yes. What I would say is mix is always going to play a role, right? And so as I talked about this year and what we're seeing, we expect some of the stronger growth to be in our lower RPU segments. And so that is going to absolutely have an impact on us. On the intermodal side, that's lower RPU. Minerals and Fertilizers, a little bit lower RPU for us. We are -- when you think about chemicals, when you think about Forest Products, when you think about Automotive, there's headwinds out there. I mean we're going to go after opportunities that we see and make sure they're accretive to the business. But mix is certainly going to impact where we see the growth come in 2026, and that will have an overall impact on the business.

Kevin touched a little bit on the coal side earlier. I just mentioned on that. I do think that not only is there domestic utility opportunity this year provided these closures that are scheduled get pushed back. But I would also say on the export side, last year, we saw the numbers, the benchmarks come down pretty significantly over the course of the year. I think what we've seen is some pretty recent stabilization there. I guess I would call out that PLV has jumped up a bit, but I think it's important to note that when you think about our business, we're more heavily indexed to high vol. And I would say that's been more stable as opposed to seeing any significant increase at this point.

Operator

The next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.

Bascome Majors
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Steve, last quarter, you gave us some thoughts early on in your tenure about your compensation philosophy and how it kind of applied to the rail model. Now that you've gotten through a few more months, you're in planning, can you talk a little bit more tactically about how you and the Board have talked about changing the incentives for senior management, both on an annual basis and a go-forward long-term basis? How are they different today than they were the last few years?

Stephen Angel
CEO, President & Director

Well, you're -- we're basically in the process of rolling out the new metrics kind of as we speak. But if you -- to your point about what I discussed last time about most important, and it's really inherent in our guidance, right? I talked about operating margins as being very important in terms of demonstrating that we can continue to improve the quality of the business. And so that's an obvious metric, operating income dollars, that's what translates into net income and earnings per share. So that's obvious -- that will always be an important metric.

Safety will always be part of the mix. And if I had to pick 3 metrics that are most important to us sitting here at this time, it'd be those 3, including safety. That's really on a year-to-year basis. And as you look into the longer term, which we call kind of 3 years, and you've heard me say, and those of you have heard me say this for many years, some of you, return on capital, I think, is the truth serum for any capital-intensive business. So return on capital is very important. And it's total shareholder return. How well are we doing compared to the S&P 500 industrials. I think that's important to all of us.

So kind of in a nutshell, those are the metrics that are most important. And I've always liked to focus the organization on a handful of really important metrics as opposed to having 8, 10, 12 as I've seen other companies do over time. And I think that's -- if you want to motivate the organization, if you want to incent the organization, you need to have metrics that are very meaningful and reinforce that every day.

The next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein.

David Vernon
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

So Steve, if you could maybe kind of address the cadence of OR improvement we're expecting as we get through this year. Should we be expecting kind of year-over-year across the board? Or is it going to be a little bit more back or front-end weighted? And then if you could put a hard number around what the benefit -- the run rate benefit you're expecting from the cost actions you've taken to date, I think that would help us kind of better understand the bridge for kind of what's organic or volume dependent and what's already kind of in the bag.

Stephen Angel
CEO, President & Director

Yes. When you -- certainly, there are comparisons when you think about what occurred in 2025, and I would obviously highlight first quarter given some of the storm activity and other things that occurred to us as a quarter where we should have good year-over-year performance probably above the average for the year. This is a continual process. As we move through the year, we continue to expect to get better and drive more cost out of the business. And we'll see if the -- what the revenue story is. We're obviously not assuming a whole lot, but there's a lot of activity around that as well.

The framework that I would use from a margin perspective is the $150 million that I certainly highlighted as not going to reoccur next year. I highlighted 3% to 3.5% inflation in our business, and you'll see that more pronounced on the labor side versus the nonlabor side. And I think you can effectively back into what we're assuming from a productivity standpoint from there.

The next question comes from Diane McKinney with Deutsche Bank.

Unknown Analyst

Kind of sticking with the OR progression, I think it was really encouraging to hear about the over 100 diverse savings initiatives that the team identified, but it also sounds like there's potential for more. But as it relates to the full year outlook of the 200 to 300 basis points of OR improvement, can you help us bridge from 2025, like are these cost savings considered? How much is dependent on the market versus what's within CSX's control? Any color there would be really helpful.

Stephen Angel
CEO, President & Director

We're not depending on the market. This is a plan that is based on the things that we can control, which is encouraging for us and this team, we're going to focus on those items. And we haven't talked about the potential for some of these markets to improve, but what we're really focused on is creating the operating leverage when the markets improve. to quite frankly, deliver higher incremental margins than what we've done in the past.

And I'm fully confident given all of the things that we're doing that every incremental dollar of revenue that Maryclare and her team are able to deliver that will come in at a very, very high incremental margin given all the cost things that we're focused on. Going back to the 100 different opportunities, it's really across everything from vehicle spend to overtime, focus on rental equipment, travel, Mike and his team, Doug, Casey, Terry, all of them have brought ideas to the table. And now it's building the process on a monthly basis to hold our teams accountable to delivering it. I'm very confident that we can do that and providing better tools, quite frankly, to the operating team and every team across this organization, so they have visibility to where the costs are.

And I'm feeling better and better about that every day. I know Mike and I collaborate on that every day. I'm sure there's things that we don't know about today that we'll continue to identify. And so our goal is to build the momentum through the year. And when that volume comes back, we're going to have a network that can handle the volume most importantly and really deliver the incremental margins.
