Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Oliver Chang with Morgan Stanley.

Unknown Analyst

Thanks for having me on today on behalf of Angel. Guys on Specialty orders, could you guys just talk a little bit more about what you're seeing on these orders? I assume they're shipping for 2028. Just curious if you can unpack what kind of pricing versus volume you're getting on those orders today? And then for the units that are already in the backlog, can you just remind us on like how the pricing will flow through? I know you're not guiding 2026 at this point, but just on the stuff that's in the backlog, how does the price flow through for next year and 2027?

Mark Skonieczny
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think, Oliver, from the perspective going forward, like so we're not going to address that from a modeling perspective. But we remain encouraged by the order rates. And obviously, as we've always discussed, we have lumpiness in the order book. But ultimately, when you look at full year being at over 1 to 1.1x for the year, as Amy said in the prepared remarks, is encouraging and really what we expected for the year.

So we continue to see strong demand and obviously, with our unit volume being up to see that the order book is holding to that as well as very encouraging from all the efforts that we've done. So I'd leave it at that from a '25 perspective.

Unknown Analyst

Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just switching gears a little bit on market share. Obviously, the tariffs they haven't really helped on the cost side for you guys. But just curious on the revenue side, have you seen any shifts in customer behavior or are you guys taking share on the back of some of these tariffs? I know potentially maybe there's some favorability for domestic trucks versus international ones. So just curious there.

Amy Campbell
Senior VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I think when you look at most of our competitors in the fire & emergency space, Oliver, they're primarily North American based. I think they have pretty similar cost structures. Obviously, they're not exactly the same. So what I would say is I don't think that there's any material competitive advantage that's being created or lost due to the tariff situation, I think our cost structures are pretty similar given most of North America fire & emergency vehicles are manufactured in North America.

Our next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre with Baird.

Joe Grabowski

It's Joe Grabowski on for Mig this morning. So Specialty Vehicles EBITDA margin nearly 14% in the fourth quarter, as you mentioned. Can you talk about what inning you're in regarding efficiency gains in both fire and in ambulance or kind of early days, middle innings? Or how much more is still left?

Mark Skonieczny
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I would say middle innings. So we're getting to that 6 or 7. So we're not at the seventh inning stretch, if you want to put it into the innings perspective, but sort of seventh inning. And I think from the -- purely from an efficiency perspective, Joe, but obviously, there's more to come, as we've talked about in the simplification and standardization that we're -- we continue to look at across the portfolio.

So we feel good that from an efficiency, we're starting to see some tailwinds there driving the unit improvements we're seeing. And then ultimately, we have other things within our 4 walls that we can address operationally beyond just getting our current workforce more efficient.

Joe Grabowski

Got it. Okay. That sounds good. And then maybe switching gears to RV, you mentioned seeing some strong interest at the recent RV Shows. Can you maybe break it down by class? I mean, does the demand feel better in the Class Bs and Class Cs or how is demand looking for the big Class As?

Mark Skonieczny
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I still would say it's lumpy on the Class A. So those go up and down. I think we're still bumping along as you see our competitors have come out as well. So I was hoping that we could say more from a perspective of where we'd end up after opening house, but I think it's still a wait and see environment. The Class C definitely in our space are doing very well. So we continue to be encouraged by our Renegade brand and some awards that they won, but also the continued momentum we see there.

And as we discussed in the last couple earnings calls, the Class B business still remains very challenged from that perspective in the market. So it's really a Class C story as well as some uptick in A, but ultimately, it's still bumping along from that perspective.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Greg Burns with Sidoti.

Gregory Burns
Sidoti & Company, LLC

You've announced some facilities investments to increase your efficiency and throughput. When you look at the backlog, where are there still opportunities within the network to invest in capacity to further increase that -- your throughput rates?

Mark Skonieczny
President, CEO & Director

Yes, I think we've made pointed investments when we talk about automation. I think we talked about that on the prepared remarks, but where we can now replacing point of failure equipment, but also when you talk about the investments we're making specifically in our branded facility and S-180 expansion, but also in our aerial facility within our E1 brand. So we are making market investments when it comes to expanding the roof line, but ultimately, within our -- all our portfolio companies, we're looking at the ability to invest in automation, some limited robotics but also just on making sure that we have the appropriate automation where we can to increase efficiency in those plants.

So it's really a focused on a couple of areas around aerial expansion as well as the S-180, but then ultimately, where we can get the most bang for the buck when it comes to efficiency improvement across the whole portfolio. and investing in different capabilities and robotics.

Gregory Burns
Sidoti & Company, LLC

Okay. I don't know if this would fall into forward-looking statements or not. But when you look at the demand cycle within the Specialty Vehicles segment, it seems to be holding up like a lower for longer type demand. Maybe you could talk about why you think that is? What's driving that? And maybe your view on when we might start to see a more normalization of the strong demand that we've seen over the last few years?

Amy Campbell
Senior VP & Chief Financial Officer

I think when you look at specialty vehicles and the fire & emergency markets, they have very strong secular tailwinds. Municipal tax budgets continue to remain strong. We have said -- we have seen that industry start to normalize, it normalized. It was normalizing during fiscal year 2025 and we expect that to continue and for it to return back to normal levels. I'm not going to predict the timeframe for that, but I think that process has already begun. But the continued strength really a result of both just good secular tailwinds as population grows and ages and then also the strength in municipal tax receipts.
