Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Konrad with Jefferies.

Greg Konrad
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Maybe just to start on the outlook for revenues. I mean, you gave a little bit of color around short cycle, but just thinking about that 4% growth, is there any way to parse organic versus inorganic given the smaller recent deals, plus how you're thinking about long-cycle growth in backlog versus maybe initial assumptions around the short-cycle businesses overall?

Robert Mehrabian
Executive Chairman

Okay. Greg, let me start with organic versus nonorganic. We think most of the growth would be organic about 3.6%, nonorganic, a little over 4%, 4.2%, about. In terms of short and long cycle, I don't see a lot of differences between those 2. We think that we have probably a little smaller increases in certain areas like environmental and test and measurement, maybe a little over 2%, but that will be offset with a healthy increase in our marine instruments, about 5%. And we think FLIR will grow just under 5%, maybe 4.6% to be accurate. So I don't see a lot of difference between short and long cycle. And as I mentioned before, we don't believe over the years, the total year in 2006 -- '26, we're going to see shrinkage of our short-cycle businesses that we have before.

Greg Konrad
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

And then maybe just a follow-up to that. I mean, you had really strong digital imaging margins in Q4. I think you called out a contingent liability reversal. But how are you thinking about the exit rate for digital imaging and maybe the biggest opportunities into 2026, given you've talked about a 24% target in the past?

Robert Mehrabian
Executive Chairman

Yes. Let me start with the question on the contingent liability. I think if you look at that and you balance it out versus [ RIF ] costs. We've been reducing costs as we go along. Fundamentally, it added about 50 basis points to our margins in Q4. So even with that, we have a 24% margin or a little in excess of 24% margin in 2025 fourth quarter. For the full year 2025, digital imaging margins came in at about 22.6%, which was about 30 basis points improved over the prior year. 2026, we're a little more hopeful, and we believe that the margins would go up maybe another 80 basis points and get to about 23.4%. And with good luck, I hope we'll get to the 24%.

Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with UBS.

Zachary Walljasper
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

This is Zack Walljasper on for Amit Mehrotra today. My first question is just the implied 1Q guidance suggests about 10% earnings growth year-on-year, while the full year guidance like implies about 7%. Just can you give some help just around the cadence of the year and like the implied deceleration because compared to last year, the earnings comps are relatively similar 1H versus 2H.

Robert Mehrabian
Executive Chairman

Yes. It's easier comps in Q1 versus last year. We improved obviously, earnings, as you said, throughout the year. Traditionally, we've been about 48% in the first half of the year in revenue and 46% in profitability. We believe that's about going to be what happens the coming year. Now I'm hoping that we can improve on both of those numbers as we get the year started. But it's the -- we just got through 3 weeks of the 2026, so I'm hesitant to go further out on a limb than I have.

Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with BNP Paribas.

Andrew Buscaglia
BNP Paribas, Research Division

I was hoping you could add some color to some of these bigger -- seemingly bigger defense awards you're talking about, specifically the [ tracking layer program ] which seems very topical currently. Can you -- any way you can size that -- the size of that award or the contribution you expect Teledyne to receive in '26 and beyond?

Robert Mehrabian
Executive Chairman

Yes. I will -- perhaps that's a question I can pass to George.

George Bobb
President, CEO & Director

Sure. So on the tracking layer, of course, we provide very high-performance infrared arrays. And that program for us will be north of $100 million over the next few years.

Andrew Buscaglia
BNP Paribas, Research Division

And what are -- you sound like you're selling to these 3 of the 4 defense primes. What can we expect in terms of margin contribution from something like that? Is it higher versus corporate average or lower or what?

George Bobb
President, CEO & Director

I would say it's about average. I mean, we -- yes.

Robert Mehrabian
Executive Chairman

Yes. It's -- as George mentioned, these are going to probably be fixed-price contracts. So our performance will improve again as it always does as a function of time. So early on, maybe our margins will be a little less. But overall, these are really good programs for us.

Andrew Buscaglia
BNP Paribas, Research Division

And this -- I imagine this is multiyear, you'll see this -- so you'll see additional contribution years out or is this something in 2026 that subsides thereafter?

George Bobb
President, CEO & Director

So we'll start to perform in 2026, but it will be over a 2- or 3-year period.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company.

James Ricchiuti
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

I apologize if you gave this on the call, I had to jump off momentarily. But did you provide an order number? And Robert, any color as to how the book-to-bill was in the main segments of the business?

Robert Mehrabian
Executive Chairman

Not yet, Jim, but I will now. First, we -- in the fourth quarter, which is our most recent numbers that I can get, we think instrumentation as of whole would be -- is about 1. Digital imaging is above 1 or 1.06. Aerospace and defense is higher at 1.25. Engineered Systems is under 1, but that's a lumpy business, and we've had some big orders during the year. So total for Q4 is 1.07. And then for the full year, if you take everything for the full year, it's about 1.08. So we feel very comfortable that in all of our segments, we're either at 1 or better than 1.

James Ricchiuti
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. What were the full year sales from the unmanned business again? If you provided it, I apologize. And I'm wondering how you're thinking about the growth in the total unmanned business in 2026, just given the pipeline?

Robert Mehrabian
Executive Chairman

In 2025, I would say our unmanned businesses combined, all combined, are about $500 million. We think that will be a little higher in '26, maybe 10% of our overall revenue.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Siegmann with Stifel.

Jonathan Siegmann
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

And maybe just following up on autonomous and unmanned. The record underwater vehicle sales, can you talk a bit more about the drivers? Last year's reconciliation bill had significant funding increases in this area. And just how relevant is this to your business? And are you seeing any benefit of it?

Robert Mehrabian
Executive Chairman

Yes. As you know, we have -- in the underwater vehicle, where we have both manned and unmanned. In the manned vehicles, we are the sole supplier to the Navy Seals, and we not only have provided all the vehicles, but there's continuous revenue from parts and maintenance. The new stuff that we're doing goes to a whole range of subsea products. Some of them have to do with infrastructure, anti-submarine warfare and some of them have to do with just observations and measurements. For example, our gliders are deployed in front of large naval operations to measure temperature and density and salinity, which all of these affect acoustic sensors and speeds.

So you have to compensate for those. We also have really good program wins, not just in the U.S. but especially in Europe for security of harbors. And we provide a whole range of underwater vehicles from very shallow ones that go only 1,000 meters down deep to very large vehicles that go as deep as 3,000 meters so -- or more. And so we have a whole suite of, I would say, I'm just looking at a picture, I think I see about 10 or 12 different underwater vehicles that we're selling not just in the U.S. These are autonomous vehicles, but also especially in Europe.

Jonathan Siegmann
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Great. And then on the loitering munitions, congratulations on that production award. Can we expect to hear anything about developments with the Army with your product?

Robert Mehrabian
Executive Chairman

Thank you. Well, there is a program called LASSO, you may be familiar with. It's a development program. And it hasn't all been announced, but it's coming up, and we're one of the participants in that program. But overall, I would say, there's not just the loitering munitions that we have introduced, but we're working on some new ones as well. So you'll hear more about that as we both develop our products as well as we win programs. I just want to make sure that when I was talking about unmanned on a question that Jim asked, our 2025 revenue on unmanned, both air, ground and underwater was about $500 million. We think that will grow about 10%. I said it'd be 10% of revenue in 2026, but it'd be probably closer to $550 million. Sorry, I needed to correct that. Go ahead, please.

Our next question comes from the line of Guy Hardwick with Barclays.

Guy Drummond Hardwick
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I just wonder how you guys feel about M&A, particularly maybe larger M&A versus share repurchases. Obviously, I saw you bought back $400 million of stock in Q4 with the stock price's big move upwards since then. And maybe that looks relatively less attractive than M&A, but I think a sense from a few months ago that you weren't particularly encouraged by M&A prices, except for maybe bolt-on deals. Maybe you can give us an update of the M&A picture and whether small versus large...

Robert Mehrabian
Executive Chairman

Sure, Guy. First, let me go back to the stock repurchases. We've been very conservative about stock repurchases. When you look at our 26-year history, we've all in bought maybe $1.2 billion and only at times where our stock was really -- we believe was really undervalued with respect to our peers and the market. So I would say the fourth quarter purchase was opportunistic as it was twice before in our history that we bought stock. Our primary driver has always been acquisitions. And you mentioned the larger acquisitions. First, we consistently like to buy what we call the string of pearls, small acquisitions that we can tuck in like the one we just announced, DD-Scientific in the U.K., would like to do that continuously regardless of whatever else happens.

On the larger acquisitions, we have a pretty good list of what's coming up, both from private equity people who bought a range of products and businesses and combined them. And we don't mind paying a reasonably good price for an acquisition as long as the quality of the mix of the businesses we're getting is there. Where we're hesitant -- and we mentioned before, where we're hesitant is when we're buying a fixer upper and we're bidding 15, 16x EBITDA, somebody else walks in and pays 21, 22x. We really don't think that's for us. But having said that, based on what we see, there's a whole range of acquisitions, what we call for us large would be, let's say, we pay $1 billion or thereabouts. There's a whole range of those that are coming, and we're more encouraged than we were in 2025.

Guy Drummond Hardwick
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And just -- that's very helpful. Just one quick modeling follow-up question. In Digital Imaging, what was the FX contribution in the quarter?

Robert Mehrabian
Executive Chairman

I can just talk to you about in general, the total contribution in -- for the year was about 40 basis points. It started negative in the year in Q1, picked up, ended in Q4 about 80 basis points and averaged out for the whole year at 40 basis points. So it was there, but it was not that significant.

Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with TD Cowen.

Joseph Giordano
TD Cowen, Research Division

I wanted to ask on memory. Obviously, prices are up a ton, and I believe there'd be applicability for you guys having to buy that across whether it's instrumentation or T&M and elements of digital imaging. So can you comment on what you're seeing there? How big a percentage of sales it is and how effective you've been able to pass that through to people?

Robert Mehrabian
Executive Chairman

Yes. Thanks, Joe. First, we don't see a risk, net risk in that area. Some of our businesses, as you said, specifically more geared towards test and measurement instrumentation do use memory and may have some constraints in supply cost inflation. Ironically, memory and storage suppliers are also reasonably large customers of our test and measurement instrumentation businesses. So if they spend incremental CapEx buy -- for proper buy to, call them, memories, then that's generally good for us because that's a higher margin contribution business for us. But coming back to what I summarized, net risk is not there.

Joseph Giordano
TD Cowen, Research Division

That's good to hear. Curious -- I guess 2 more for me. One, can you just run us through the organic kind of by segment, what you're thinking for next year? And then I also like a bigger picture, do you think -- there's been talk from the government about restricting defense companies and what they can do with their balance sheets and how they spend their money. Do you see yourself -- I think I know your answer, but do you see yourself in that population of companies that would be potentially targeted there? And if no, does it make you want to do things that others can't because you have less restrictions?

Robert Mehrabian
Executive Chairman

Yes. Well, let me tell you, we've never been driven by what others do anyways. As I said, our preference is buying companies and investing in our businesses. But let me go back. Teledyne, as said, we've rarely bought our shares back. So $1.2 billion in share buybacks over a 26-year history is not a whole lot considering we generate that much cash in the last 2 years every year. Having said that, we've never paid a dividend. And we're more concerned about investing. If we can't buy companies, we're more inclined to invest in our businesses. For example, just last year, we increased our CapEx by 40%, and we increased our R&D spending by 10%. So if we can't find really good acquisitions, even though last year was a good year for acquisitions, we invest in CapEx and R&D, and we're going to do that moving forward. There are pockets of our businesses that are performing really well and like where we supply cooled and uncooled infrared sensors and cameras to our various customers will increase more CapEx there.

Having said all of that, we've always been a commercial company, albeit we do have significant defense businesses, can go as high as 30%. But overall, also most of our defense businesses are fixed price businesses. I don't think it really applies to us. But nevertheless, since we don't buy a lot of our own stock, I don't think I'm so concerned about that. Now you asked about revenue. Organic, we believe organic revenue growth, I mentioned this before, but I'll do it very quickly. In Digital Imaging, it'd be about 3.5%. Overall, it'd be around that 3.5%, 3.6%. Aerospace and Defense may be a little higher. Instruments would be around that. But we like the fact that it's around 3.5% to 4% in our various businesses. We don't expect any of our businesses to decline.

Our next question comes from the line of Alex Preston with Bank of America.

Alexander Christian Preston
BofA Securities, Research Division

I just wanted to touch on 737. It seems like we got some more certainty on rate increases at the end of '25. Just wondering if there's been any change to your thinking on destocking into '26.

Robert Mehrabian
Executive Chairman

I'll ask George to answer it. I don't think so. But George?

George Bobb
President, CEO & Director

Yes, I would say no major change. And I would just keep in mind that our overall Commercial Aviation business is only about 5% of the business and only about 1/3 of our aviation business is OEM and only a portion of that is Boeing. So no major change there for us.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Rob Jamieson with Vertical Research Partners.

Robert Jamieson
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Guys, nice quarter. Just quickly on test and measurement. Just can you go through some of the demand drivers there? Was that mostly the Ethernet test again that was driving the strength? And did you see any kind of improvements in some of the other end markets that you serve that might be related to like auto or anything like that, that you could provide insight on?

Robert Mehrabian
Executive Chairman

Yes. I would say, Rob, in the immediate future, our oscilloscopes, high-end specialty oscilloscopes are doing well and will continue to do so, both from the auto market as well as from motor control and power control in the larger data centers. And also, we have a product, a small company that generates Ethernet traffic capability, so we can simulate that. And basically, what's happened to the Ethernet, it's moving to the terabit range, 1.6 terabit to be accurate. And we do have products in that domain. In some of our protocol analyzer business, we expect a little slower start in '26, primarily because that business is very dependent on where the large suppliers issue or produce chips. Before they produce their chips, they use our protocol analyzers, the engineers to develop the chips. But until they issue the chips, the users don't buy our protocol analyzers. So there's a little gap in that domain with the 2 major producers of chips having delayed things. But as we move into the year, that will even itself out. So that's the best answer I can give you.

Robert Jamieson
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

No, that's helpful. And then just looking at some of the legacy machine vision and CMOS X-ray businesses in digital imaging. Are there any -- as you see the machine vision business starting to recover and you don't expect that to be negative this year, are there any particular end markets or exposures there where you'd expect the most upside? And then I guess on the X-ray CMOS sensors business, just some of the commentary that we've seen recently from [ Dentsply ] that they're expecting recovering sales in the second half of '26. Just kind of aligned with -- I know you talked about seasonality in the second half, but would you continue to expect like a sequential improvement for the medical portions within DI as we move through 2026?

Robert Mehrabian
Executive Chairman

I'll ask George to pick that up, please. But in general, I'd say we're going to do okay in the machine vision domain because of mask and semiconductor inspection, et cetera. I'll let the X-ray for George to comment on.

George Bobb
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I would also just add on the machine vision side, we saw good single-digit growth in both machine vision cameras and machine vision sensors in Q4. And we expect in that overall industrial and scientific vision to be up kind of low single digits in 2026. So we were certainly seeing the recovery there. And as Robert mentioned, that's areas like semiconductor mask and wafer inspection and the inspection of electronic components. On the X-ray side, really, we're kind of anticipating flat year-over-year in 2026. We have not built in a recovery in that business in 2026.
