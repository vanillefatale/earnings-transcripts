[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays.

Adrienne Yih-Tennant
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

First of all, congratulations on the milestone. Great to see sales growing again. Bracken, I guess the big question for the year is kind of the price increases that are happening broadly, not just kind of at your company, but broadly across the space, starting to come through, potential consumer demand erosion. And obviously, we got some consumer conference board metrics yesterday, some competing ones against sentiment versus consumer confidence. How are you thinking about the consumer? What metrics are you looking at to assess whether there is sort of a slowing? And what is your kind of plan if we do see that?

Then number two, for Paul, if you can just talk about you're close to your gross margin, as you just said, the FY '28 target. How should we think about that in terms of potential upside to the margin now that you're also gaining leverage on the sales?

Bracken Darrell
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Adrienne, and it is very exciting to be positive again. And that's what we're here for. It's all about growth. On the -- in terms of the market and price increases and all the consumer sentiment discussions we're all having, I think it's -- the good news for us is we have so much under -- within our control. I have never been in a position where I felt like we had many levers to pull to really drive our business. So it's kind of the nature of a turnaround. We're in that sweet spot right now where we've just gone positive. We've got a lot of engine firing, a lot of green shoots in every direction. So I feel really confident even in a really choppy environment that we're going to do well.

Paul Vogel
EVP & CFO

Yes. And then on the gross margin side, yes, I mean, we are getting close to 55%. I think all along, our target was 55% or better. So we're -- it's great that we're sort of heading in that direction. I mean obviously, keep in mind, tariffs are just starting to hit us. We've talked about our ability to mitigate those tariffs within fiscal '27 and nothing's changed on that at all. So I'd say, a, we feel good about where we are on gross margin. We've made great progress. B, 55% is obviously the target, but hopefully, over time, we can do better than that. And C, we feel like we're in really good shape. But obviously, we got to make sure that we're able to manage the tariffs the way we expect. And we -- again, we have no reason to expect we won't. But again, just something to keep -- keep in mind forward.

Your next question comes from the line of Tom Nikic with Needham.

Tom Nikic
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

I want to ask about Vans. So the last couple of quarters, you kind of said that the underlying trend was down high single digits, excluding some of the deliberate actions you took. Was that the case also in Q3? And then for Q4, you're guiding to down mid-singles, which is kind of an improvement from there. So is it kind of safe to assume that you're expecting some improvement in the underlying Vans trend, I guess, kind of beginning in Q4 and hopefully thereafter?

Bracken Darrell
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean I think that's a pretty good description of what we see going on. We're finally lapping that quarter those -- that year ago quarter when we took a lot of strong actions, and we feel really good about the steps we're taking. I talked briefly in my introduction about some of the green shoots we're seeing. But I think it's the first time we saw e-com growth in something like 19 quarters or so it's a long time. We feel really good about that. We're excited about -- we saw traffic up in the U.S. We saw a lot of strength in the U.S. in general.

The new products are picking up steam, Super Lowpro and the Skate Loafer, which I'm tempted to pull off my foot and show you because I bet a lot of you have not -- okay, I'm going to do it. A lot of you have not seen -- this is such a cool product because it literally is a Skate Loafer. So I could almost go out and shoot around and play basketball on this thing, but it's a loafer and it looks good. So we've got a lot of good things. And even in the icons, which have been such a difficult area for us for so many years, we're seeing some bright spots. We really innovating against those icons. The Authentic and the Slip-On, both -- we've seen real improvement trends there, even in the Old Skool. So overall, I feel just very, very good about Vans, but we're going to be patient. We're not going to push it. We're not going to force anything. We're going to let this thing really play out as it should. We've learned one thing about turnarounds. You don't want to force a turnaround early. You want to let it develop, and we are letting it develop.

Paul Vogel
EVP & CFO

And just, yes, you're right on the numbers. The reported constant dollar was down 10%. Again, on the like-for-like, it is kind of down high single digits in the same way we talked about it in quarters past. And so yes, the underlying trend kind of down high single digits. And obviously, I guided to down mid-single digits for Q4. So there is some improvement there in the underlying trend in Q4.

Bracken Darrell
President, CEO & Director

I'm waiting for an Alex Honnold question. First one gets a prize.

Your next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs.

Brooke Roach
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Brack and Paul, I was hoping you could unpack the sequential acceleration that you saw at TNF Americas this quarter. How much of the strength is repeatable as you move into calendar 2026? How are inventory levels exiting the season? And were there any onetime tailwinds that may have benefited the trend this holiday season?

Bracken Darrell
President, CEO & Director

I'm going to let you talk about the inventories. What I'd say is, I don't -- we're not really forecasting into '27. What I would say is the underlying business was very strong in the Americas, but I think it's more a reflection of the fact that we are just very weakly developed in the Americas. We have a lot of upside there. Compared to the other regions of the world, whether you look at average price or our market share, we're just underdeveloped what we could be given this is our home market. We've got so many places we can grow there, and you saw them this quarter, and you see them in the Americas. You've got -- we grew in our footwear business. We grew in e-com. We really just grew across the -- we talked about elevated products we're launching. So we've got just one after another thing that we really -- levers we can pull, and they're all very, very visible in the Americas. Probably the strongest opportunity in the world right now is the Americas. So I feel really good about what's happening there. And we don't want to forecast into '27, but I don't see anything extraordinary about this quarter that makes it an outlier. I really think this is the kind of -- we should be able to deliver strong performance across The North Face over time.

Paul Vogel
EVP & CFO

Yes. On the inventory side, dollars are up slightly. That's just to support the strong sales we've had. But overall, inventory days are down pretty much across the board.

Bracken Darrell
President, CEO & Director

You know what else is really good, Brooke, is so many things aren't working well enough yet. We have so many things we can do better, and that makes me even more optimistic. If I look at APAC, I'm sure I'm going to get a question there. APAC, we're soft. And we know we're going to be soft, we'll be soft probably through most of next year because we've really consolidated gains. We've had such a long period of strong growth in APAC. We've really expanded our distribution. We're where we ought to be. Now we need to get -- we're missing some products. We really need to have there and get our marketing rev up even more. By the way, thank you, Alex.

And then in EMEA, EMEA is just a macro -- kind of a macro slowdown. I mean we have a really good business in EMEA and optimistic for The North Face there. But I think in general, if you just look across our portfolio, we have a really good performance, and we can do a lot better.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Evercore.

Michael Binetti
Evercore Inc.

I'll add my congrats to the positive inflection there. Did you -- I guess for Vans, did you see the traffic in the U.S. stores improved sequentially? I know you said it improved all the way to positive digitally. Are the stores following that trend to a lag? So we see some impact from the new products working in the physical stores? And then I'm curious, any kind of initial thought you can give us to how the order books are building up for Vans for back-to-school.

Bracken Darrell
President, CEO & Director

We probably won't talk about the order books because we usually don't. But I'd say in terms of traffic in stores, no, we didn't see it in stores. I mean it was just traffic -- physical traffic is much tougher to get rolling, and I think it's going to take us longer. But we're really excited about the traffic we saw online. So I think we're just going to have to keep going. We continue to try to identify ways that we think we can start to bring the traffic up in our stores. And that is -- that's kind of the holy grail, and we get that going, look out. But right now, the traffic online is exciting to see.

And I do think things like Demon Hunters, like some of the really specialized products we're launching, we need to direct them more into our stores first. So that you really have to come to our stores to see them because we've got some really cool things that are kind of exclusive. And you look at Demon Hunter, that was super. But we refilled that already, and we've already sold really strongly in the second running of that. So we need to be bringing those more into our stores and making sure our customers are aware that's the place to buy them. We might have made it too easy to buy some of that stuff online. So anyway, so bottom line is, no, the traffic in stores wasn't up yet. But give us time, I think we'll get there.

Paul Vogel
EVP & CFO

Yes. I would just add that traffic is still down. We did see a slight improvement sequentially from Q2 to Q3. So traffic to Bracken's point, is still down. We haven't yet seen positive traffic yet, but at least the trend is moving in the right direction.

Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with Guggenheim.

Simeon Siegel
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

I was curious if you could help how you're thinking about the broader just AUR versus unit dynamic across the brands as you're seeing these inflections. And then Bracken, it feels like you're starting to speak, at least mentioned Altra a little bit more than historically. Anything you can elaborate on the brand, the signals you're seeing there just to give you confidence that maybe this becomes a VFC pillar brand, if I'm reading the Easter eggs correctly. Obviously, early, but any way to think about how you'd see sizing potential of that brand? And then just lastly, out of curiosity, what floor were you waving to Alex on as he did that? What's my price?

Bracken Darrell
President, CEO & Director

It's average unit retail, but AUR versus retail -- so first of all, Altra, yes, you do hear me talking about it more. You can see me wearing it a lot more. I've become a raving fan both from -- both because I love the business and also because I love the product. So I've also got a few things I don't want to talk about just yet, but we'll bring them out a little bit later of other people that are now wearing this product that you're going to be surprised at. So we've got a lot of quiet momentum. And as I've said before, we're really holding the brand back. I mean it could be growing faster. We're just not letting it go because we want to control distribution, make sure it's in the places where it establishes a really strong pedigree and awareness as a running brand and a running brand, not just on the trail, but also on the road.

So I am excited about Altra. I do think it's got -- I said it before, I think it's got $1 billion-plus potential, and it's up to us to make that happen. I was with the founder yesterday here in our Denver headquarters. And he was -- he said to me, he said, when we -- he said, I remember the day when I knew that business could hit $500 million. And I said, "Wow, I remember the day when I knew it could hit $1 billion. So we're both living a little bit in the future. He was before and we are now, but it's going to go over $250 million this year, probably $270 million and I see a lot of potential beyond that. Do you want to average?

Paul Vogel
EVP & CFO

Yes. I mean I'd say across all the brands, not much change. I'd say for Vans in particular, you're seeing a little bit of an uptick in AUR in the Americas, which is great. And TNF AUR is up as is Timberland. So they're all up, nothing, I would say, too crazy, but all up like moderately.

Bracken Darrell
President, CEO & Director

I know you're joking about the floor I was on waving at Alex. I was hiding under my couch waving at Alex while he was on TV. And I was -- I literally had it on in the other room and I would walk in and watch it for a few seconds, and I had to run back out of there. That was the most terrifying thing I've ever seen. But I talked to Alex when he flew back when we got back in Las Vegas. And it's amazing how humble the guy is, and he's such a great reflection of what it is to be a great human being and a great athlete. And he reflects it really reflects what unfortunately, you can't see every day, which is we have 100 -- 200 people like a lot like Alex, who are super courageous. They really love, love, love what they're doing. They really would and some of them do, do it for almost free or free. And it's just exciting to be part of a business that has a little piece of that.

Your next question comes from the line of Tracy Kogan with Citigroup.

Tracy Kogan
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I was hoping you could talk more about the drivers of the gross margin beat versus your expectations in this quarter. Wondering if you were able to mitigate more. I know you mentioned mix and lower product costs, but I was also wondering about promotions versus your expectations. And then if you could just talk about the drivers of your view for gross margin to be up -- flat to up slightly in 4Q?

Paul Vogel
EVP & CFO

Yes. So on the puts and takes on gross margins, it's a little bit less promotion. So the full price was better. We did have a tariff impact, which we did not mitigate, and we got a little bit of a benefit on the sourcing side. So those are kind of the main components in -- on the gross margin side. And then for Q4, kind of similar trends. We will have some pricing benefiting us to help mitigate some of the tariff impact in Q4 that we didn't have in Q3.

Tracy Kogan
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Are you expecting lower promotions year-over-year similar to 3Q?

Paul Vogel
EVP & CFO

We don't really talk that much. I mean maybe slightly. We've been -- again, we've been getting a little bit better in that overall, but I would say slightly, but nothing really to call out.

Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Komp wit Baird.

Jonathan Komp
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I'm surprised nobody suggested yet, Alex, do the next climb in the Skate Loafer, just as a thought for cross-brand initiative there. But Bracken, if I could follow up, just in your view, what's it going to take to translate positive global digital traffic for Vans into total growth as you think forward here or a better trajectory for total revenue? And then, Paul, if I could just follow up, the medium-term targets, I think you've said you're not putting all the eggs in the basket for fiscal 2028. So can you just give any more flavor how you see revenue and the margin progression playing out at a high level?

Bracken Darrell
President, CEO & Director

I'll take the first 2, and then Paul can take away it was directed to you. So in terms of how is that translation of this -- finally seeing some good traffic on Vans going to eventually turn into growth on Vans. I've just so carefully avoided ever saying when will the brand turn positive and I'll do it again. But I would say it is a very good sign. And I think we've got -- we also have just a lot of -- there's a lot of good brand discussion now happening at the Tier 0 accounts. We've really got strong interest in our very premium elevated product that we're launching, which we're bringing down into our channels and over time into the wholesale channels, too. So I'm really -- I love the path that we're on. It really does feel like the right kind of meaningful path. When I talk to the team that's running the business, you could feel the enthusiasm they have for it. Now they're admittedly living into the future. We live a year out and 2 out, but I feel really good about what they feel. So it's really very, very exciting. I think I will call Alex when we hang up and talk to them about the Skate Loafer for climb. It seems like a great idea.

Paul Vogel
EVP & CFO

So on the medium-term targets, yes, I mean look, we still feel good about all those targets. So nothing changes from the perspective of what we've given you in terms of our goals, where we get to. So you think about the operating margin, we said it will be 6.5% or better this year, exit run rate, fiscal '28 to 10%. So you can assume we're going to have some improvements in '27, '28 to get there. So we still expect to get that. We continue to pay down debt. So if you think about we went from 4.1x to 3.5x leverage. So you can see there's a pretty clear path to go from 3.5x to 2.5x just if we stayed where we are, we obviously expect our operating income to do better and our operating cash flow to do better over time, which will obviously help on reducing that leverage. And so we feel like we're in a really good place to hit that 2.5x leverage.

And our free cash flow was strong this year, and it was strong in the face of $100 million headwind from tariffs, a $35 million headwind from Dickies. And we also are spending about 33%, 35% more in CapEx right now year-to-date. And so -- and we're able to do all that and still generate the free cash flow we want to continue to pay down debt. So we feel like we're in a really good place to hit those targets. And as we get closer to the end of the year, we'll give you more guidance and thoughts on fiscal '27.

Bracken Darrell
President, CEO & Director

I'll just throw out one thought on debt. You heard -- those of you who have been listening for a while, you've heard both Paul and me independently and practically as a do out, say how much we dislike debt. And it's -- that's certainly not changed, which is why we're aggressively bringing down the debt levels. But there's a big benefit to that, which is it's really forced us to not rely on M&A. And so we've really focused on organic growth. And it's the reason why you saw us go positive this quarter. It's complete obsession with getting our businesses growing and our brands growing the right way, so systematically. I think it's partly because there is that discipline of debt hanging out there that as we bring it down, we're bringing it down fast. We don't have a lever that we're going to go try to pull on M&A. We're going to grow these brands. We have amazing brands and some of the particularly impressive brands we have, we don't talk about very much. So we've got growth opportunities across the board.

Your next question comes from the line of Anna Andreeva with Piper Sandler.

Unknown Analyst

This is Noah on for Anna. So good to hear Vans expected down mid-single digits for 4Q. Can you elaborate how we should think about DTC versus wholesale for the brand? And then anything by geo going forward? And then as a follow-up, on North Face, you've mentioned premiumization as a focus as an opportunity for the brand. How do you think about that? And why now is the right time to do so? How do you envision The North Face positioning versus some of the newer brands in the category?

Bracken Darrell
President, CEO & Director

Yes. On the DTC versus wholesale, I probably -- if you had to rank them, I'd say probably we'll see -- first of all, if you asked me where am I focused? I'm focused on the Americas right now. It's 50% of the Vans business. As the North American market goes, Vans goes. So we're really focused there. So -- and then within that, I would say, yes, DTC first, but even there, e-com first. So e-com is the fastest lever we can pull because the products can get there faster, they can be displayed well. We're getting better at social marketing, which we can bring consumers to our site. And so between good products and good marketing, I think you'll see that we're really keeping our eye on DTC for Vans first, but particularly e-com. And the stores are harder. So that's going to come. It's just going to come with a little lag and then wholesale after that.

In terms of premiumization for North Face, why now? It's kind of one of those things where there's just -- it's such a great opportunity, and I'll go back to the comment I made a minute ago, especially in North America, we're not going to go start selling 50% of our business at $1,100. But we do have opportunities around the world in premiumization.

Summit Series, we don't talk about it that way, but Summit Series is a very premium product lineup, and it's very small today, but it has a really good growth potential, too, as does the more lifestyle-oriented product like the Leather Pack that we talked about. So there's -- why now? Because there's just such a good opportunity. You're not going to see us go crazy. We're not. I don't like jigsaw. I don't like these ups and downs. I like systematic growth. So you'll see us systematically change that North Face offering to systematically see us premiumize. So don't expect a revolutionary change. That would be dangerous in my view. We're going to do it systematically and carefully and well.

Your final question comes from the line of Jay Sole with UBS [Operator Instructions].

Bracken Darrell
President, CEO & Director

I thought you were on the fourth floor and you lost connection like Alex.

Jay Sole
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I don't think I was admitted to the fourth floor on that. I would have been up on that [indiscernible] and I climbed. But I think the question is about guidance. We're still doing 1 quarter time guidance. How are you thinking about possibly giving full year guidance? What needs to change for you to start giving a longer-term outlook?

Bracken Darrell
President, CEO & Director

I'm going to jump in ahead of Paul because I'm afraid he's going to answer that we agree with, but we haven't decided whether we really agree with it. Look, at the end of the day, we pull guidance because I think you can guide when you have predictability. And then we haven't put it back because, gosh, it's really nice not to give full year guidance. It's really comfortable. But we also know that investors like it. And so we're seriously considering. We're going to think through it, and we're weighing the pros and cons. It's a really -- I think it's a really good thing in some ways and a really bad thing in other ways from some viewpoints. But we're thinking carefully through it. And I promise you that we are not underestimating that there's a lot of interest out there for it. So stay tuned.

Jay Sole
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Bracken, maybe just a follow up on that. I mean just given the fourth quarter is coming up, I mean, would the fourth quarter be a more important quarter to try to reintroduce that kind of full year guide? Or does it really not matter what quarter you're reporting?

Bracken Darrell
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean, logically, if you were going to reintroduce the guide, you'd probably do it in the fourth quarter of this year or next year or something. So yes, I think that makes a lot of sense, either they close the quarter kind of after you finish the year or something like that.

Paul Vogel
EVP & CFO

Yes. I would just add one thing on guidance, too, because I know this quarter, obviously, we exceeded expectations. Our philosophy on guidance in terms of whatever we guide hasn't really changed, right? We're always going to give ranges. Our goal is to hit the top end of the range in a really good quarter, exceed the range, but really at the top end of the range. And so nothing has changed with that. So I know sometimes you have quarters where you're right in the range, sometimes you have quarters when you outperform. We outperformed just organically in this quarter. If you look at the outperformance, it was really all DTC. DTC is obviously a little bit less predictable than wholesale. And so our guidance philosophy hasn't changed. We just had a really strong quarter and it was really led by DTC, which can always be a little bit more variable in any quarter. So I just want to kind of reiterate sort of how we think about guidance.

Bracken Darrell
President, CEO & Director

It sounds like that's the last question unless you have another one, operator.

Operator

There are no further questions at this time.

Bracken Darrell
President, CEO & Director

Okay. Well, I'll bring this to a close. We feel great about our progress. We feel great about the results we delivered this quarter. There are so many things that we can do better. That's the best news. We're really seeing great improvement and we have so many more things to make better. So I'm really excited about where we are. I'm going to -- at some point soon, I'm going to stop calling this a turnaround of V.F. because it will no longer be. It's about growth. And we're going to stay focused on really fulfilling this enormous potential we have across each of our brands, all of our brands and creating exceptional shareholder value. So thanks, everyone. Stay tuned. We'll see you in a quarter.
