[Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Brooke Roach from Goldman Sachs.

Brooke Roach
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Have you seen a sales impact in China following the fireworks incident? If so, when do you expect sales to recover? Do you think there could be any longer-term brand repercussions?

Stuart Haselden
CEO of Arc'teryx

Brooke, it's Stuart. Thanks for your question. Arc’teryx China sales trends were softer at the beginning of Q4, but have since rebounded as weather has cooled. We are confident in Arc’teryx's brand position and equity with consumers across all of our markets. We are most focused on connecting with our consumers and communities and delivering great products and store experiences.

Operator

Great. And as a follow-up for Andrew, how did this event impact guidance for 4Q?

Andrew Page
Chief Financial Officer, Interim President & CEO of Wilson

It did not have a factor in our Q4 guide.

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.

Matthew Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats on a nice quarter. So James, could you speak to your confidence in guiding 2026 revenue growth to mid-teens, which is the high end of your long-term algorithm? And then, Stuart, at Arc’teryx, could you break down the cadence of the third quarter 27% omni-comp? And if you could elaborate on the strong global momentum that you've seen in the fourth quarter or just any change in demand that you've seen as we head into holiday for the brand?

Jie Zheng
CEO & Director

I'll just highlight our forecast for coming years. So we -- given the very solid foundation we built up in 2025, I think we have a -- the management team got a very good level of confidence to deliver what we guide in 2026. I think mid-teen growth patterns can be secured in 2026.

Stuart Haselden
CEO of Arc'teryx

Yes, Matt, it's Stuart. So yes, the omni-comp, we're really pleased to see the momentum in the third quarter. The overall D2C revenue increase of 46%, we think is really healthy. The 27% omni-comp also reflects a strong 2-year trajectory, and that's definitely factored into how we thought about guidance into the fourth quarter. As we look at Q3 specifically, the retail performance was -- from a KPI standpoint was driven by traffic. So we saw really healthy traffic increases, more modest increases in conversion and AOV and [EPT].

Also worth mentioning, markdown levels were pretty consistent year-over-year. So it was not a markdown-driven sales increase. As you look at your -- and your question around the global demand, strong momentum around all of our regions, it was great to see an acceleration in our North American business in the third quarter, where they moved up in the ranking after Asia Pacific, which continues to be the leading region for us. But we still saw some very strong growth in China and in Europe. So we're not really seeing weakness in any of our regions. And it makes us optimistic as we look at fourth quarter and beyond. And yes, so I think feeling really good for how we've now stepped into the fourth quarter and the trends we're seeing quarter-to-date.

Your next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo.

Irwin Boruchow
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Let me add my congrats. I guess a higher-level question on next year's outlook, just maybe potential additional info on door growth for both technical, basically both for Salomon and Arc’teryx. And then would love to hear a little bit more about the progress on Salomon in the United States specifically? Andrew, can you give us an update of where you are in penetration there? Just there seems to be a lot of appetite for the brand locally here. Just kind of curious how you're measuring that, balancing the growth with the push-pull model?

Omar Saad
Senior Vice President of Group Investor Relations & Capital Markets

We'll have Andrew actually take the first question, and then we have Guillaume Meyzenq here who's the CEO of Solomon brand, who will take the Solomon question.

Andrew Page
Chief Financial Officer, Interim President & CEO of Wilson

Yes, thanks for the question. With regard to detail on store growth, I will provide more of that update as we get into our Q4 call. So not necessarily ready to provide a detailed update on store growth yet.

Guillaume Meyzenq
President & CEO of Salomon

And for Salomon, so nice to meet you all. Before jumping into North America, I think that we have to put Salomon into the context and the current momentum we have. So I'm convinced that we hold a truly distinctive position in the market, and we will fully leverage it to shape what's come next. We have an incredible opportunity to define and lead the modern mountain sports movement in the market. And if identify a few strengths of Salomon, the first one is the authentic mountain performance, which is what consumer is looking for is authenticity. We are true to what we are doing.

We have a global recognition of design language led by innovation. What we are doing and developing is really true for performance, for function. And we have a growing cultural relevance reaching the mountain, the city and the modern lifestyle. And this quarter is definitely the good example of the potential of Salomon in the market, and we believe that this is just a start.

If I move on the U.S. case because this is a question, of course, this is today the region that we have to build the fundamentals. So we are showing a strength in EMEA. We are very -- growing very fast in Asia Pacific and China. And today, we are focusing on U.S. And the U.S. provision is coming from this leading position in winter sports and outdoor where Salomon has high market share and high recognition in the market. And now we have to move to the city.

And this is what is currently happening by a true epicenter strategy so that we started in New York a few quarters ago. Now we have L.A., the new shop opening we have in Melrose is a good example of a long line of consumer looking at this product. We have also good traction in running specialty distribution in performance.

And now it's how we -- all this good signal and insight, which is coming with a new consumer, very often a female consumer, how we are transitioning and translating into a bigger scale in U.S. And this is why we look at more epicenter, more shop opening, having a curated media investment in the right spaces and of course, working with our B2B partner to drive the numeric distribution will expose Salomon to more consumers. And we feel very confident that we are on the right path to accelerate in North America.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.

Lorraine Maikis
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just sticking with Solomon, you're pruning back some of the distribution there, which is causing a pressure. Can you talk about when that pressure will abate? And where you are on U.S. awareness at this point for the Solomon brand?

Unknown Executive

I think you still speak about U.S. And of course, as I explained, we have this leading position in winter sports and outdoor performance and footwear. And this outdoor performance footwear led us a few years ago to go to places and some distribution that we think they are not anymore relevant, and we think -- and also the partner sometimes also is looking for other purity.

This is why we have this kind of looking like negative -- some negative building block, which show finally kind of growth, but not growth expected as we would. We think that the end of H1 '26 will be the last time that we will not have any more anniversary sales, and we will have completely fresh and new setup for distribution. So we still wait for the -- for a few quarters, but I would say that the most of the change has been already implemented.

Your next question comes from the line of Jay Sole from UBS.

Jay Sole
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I want to ask about Wilson, specifically the Tennis 360 stores. It sounds like -- I think you said you're up to 80 stores in China. Can you just talk about the big picture long-term opportunity in China? And I think you also mentioned that the store in Dallas, I think you said is off to a good start and you're opening some more Tennis 360 stores in the U.S. Can you just talk about the Tennis 360 opportunity outside of China and how that's developed over the last 90 days in your view?

Andrew Page
Chief Financial Officer, Interim President & CEO of Wilson

Thanks, Jay. So you mentioned the Tennis 360 concept outside of Greater China. So we have 14, 15 stores in North America. I mentioned the Dallas Park store that's doing really well. We will focus really around the Smile States. So you think about where you concentrate tennis in the Southern Smile of the U.S. starting in Georgia down to Florida, around the south and then back up through California. So that's what I would expect to see from our retail format epicenter concentration. We are still -- we're in the early stages of that.

We're excited and we're super motivated about where it's going. The consumer is really gravitating towards the product, but we're still in the early stages of really optimizing and formulating our total owned retail format. In addition to our owned retail format, we've also seen success in our DICK'S shop in-shop format, where we are able to present the full pathway of our Tennis 360 concept at the [indiscernible] and the consumer is really resonating with the consumer there. So you'll start to see the expansion even in the DICK'S and the House of Sports format for the DICK'S locations.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citigroup.

Paul Lejuez
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

On the margin guide for next year, I'm curious how much of the expansion is simply a function of business mix versus improvements that you might be seeing within each segment? And then I just wanted to ask a clarifying point on Solomon. Could you just say what is the number of doors that you're actually exiting in the -- within the Solomon wholesale business? And then what are you adding over the next 12 months?

Stuart Haselden
CEO of Arc'teryx

Yes. Paul, thanks a lot. The same drivers of our mix shift is as before. It's going to be primarily driven by gross margin expansion. We will continue to make the proper investments in SG&A to continue to drive growth. So the margin expansion that you see will be driven primarily by gross margin expansion, that gross margin expansion is driven primarily by mix shift, both channel and product and region mix shift.

As it relates to the number of doors, we're not necessarily going to comment. It's a bit nuanced as Guillaume talked about exiting some wholesale doors that could tell our full expression of the brand and getting into more strategic partners. But as we talked about, start to think about clearing that through H1 of next year and then you start to see as we get into the third quarter of next year, you start to see the brand really show up in the strategic partners that we...

Your next question comes from the line of Anna Andreeva from Piper Sandler.

Anna Andreeva
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Congrats. We wanted to follow up on the Americas. Nice to see the region accelerate to high teens. Can you provide more color what you saw by channel? And how did U.S. perform within that? I think you mentioned slight growth at Wilson in the U.S. And as you look into '26 and the high end of the algo, should we expect Americas as a double-digit grower next year? And then we just had a quick follow-up. The CA omni-comp acceleration, great to hear about strength in traffic. Did that headwind from outlet that you saw last quarter begin to moderate? And just remind us, when do we anniversary that outlet dynamic in '26?

Jie Zheng
CEO & Director

Thanks, Anna. So we'll have Stuart answer the comp and talk about the Arc’teryx. We really think about your first question by brand, not at the group level. So since we have each of the brand CEOs here, we'll let each of them to answer.

Stuart Haselden
CEO of Arc'teryx

Anna, it's Stuart. Yes, the acceleration in North America for Arc’teryx is really a function of success of our brand awareness, investments in community and different forms of brand marketing and with the growth of our store footprint. The stores are providing critical catalyst for driving guest engagement and brand awareness across our key markets. So we're pleased to see the success of that reflected in omni-comp.

With regard to the -- I'll just stay on the traffic question that you had. The traffic really reflects what I just mentioned that we saw a meaningful reduction in markdown revenue in the first half of the year. So into Q3, we saw our markdowns basically on par, consistent with prior year. So as we think about next year, obviously, we would begin to lap that -- and then Anna, we have Tennis 360 in the Americas, if there's any commentary around channel and the trends there and, [indiscernible] if you want to comment on, I think you covered it pretty well.

Andrew Page
Chief Financial Officer, Interim President & CEO of Wilson

Yes. I mean to your point around the uptick in North America, it was primarily driven by our Tennis 360 concept, both in footwear and apparel, both very, very strong growth in the quarter. And the other categories in Wilson also was strong, notably racquet sports was pretty strong, bats was strong, although baseball was relatively flat because it was offset by some challenges with gloves. But that's -- we're really excited about what we're seeing and how that's really inflected and returned to strong growth this quarter.

Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Komp from Baird.

Jonathan Komp
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Can I follow up just the initial 2026 view, would you expect technical apparel to be at least in line with the algorithm from September, mid-teens growth with China at least low double digits? Any color there?

Andrew Page
Chief Financial Officer, Interim President & CEO of Wilson

Yes, this is Andrew. As you pointed out, we have reaffirmed the full algorithm from Investor Day, both at the brand level as well as at the group level.

Jonathan Komp
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Great. And then a follow-up just on the Q4 outlook, Andrew, operating profit growth has been very strong in the first 3 quarters, over 60%. It looks like you're embedding a single-digit growth rate in profit for the fourth quarter. So could you just share any more detail, anything unique in the fourth quarter impacting the margin outlook? And is there anything we should expect into the first half of '26 in terms of margin headwinds?

Andrew Page
Chief Financial Officer, Interim President & CEO of Wilson

Yes, definitely. As I'll point out, obviously, really strong third quarter. We're excited about it. You see what happens when we're able to over deliver top line, we're able to drop that through to the bottom line. In the fourth quarter, as you start to think about what we're seeing, we still believe we're excited about our full year, you can see the implied guidance for the fourth quarter. But as Guillaume talked about, we're in the early stages of this inflection point. Fourth quarter will be the first full quarter of tariffs. We also have investments that we're making in [indiscernible] and invested in obviously continued market around our [indiscernible]. So we believe the guide for the full year and the implied guidance for the fourth quarter is responsible as well as we continue to say should demand materialize, we are -- there's no structural reason why we won't be able to overdeliver against our guidance.

Your next question comes from the line of John Kernan from TD Cowen.

John Kernan
TD Cowen, Research Division

Congrats on another strong quarter. Andrew, just to kind of follow-up on Jonathan's question. The guidance for the Outdoor Performance segment margin is for a decline in Q4. Obviously, there's been a ton of upside to your guidance this year and the incremental margin you've been generating on the soft goods really seems to be flowing through. I'm just curious why the conservatism here in Outdoor Performance and how you're thinking about the margin performance of Outdoor Performance into next year?

Andrew Page
Chief Financial Officer, Interim President & CEO of Wilson

Yes. I mean a couple of things. As I talked about, there were some early shipments into the third quarter for sports equipment. We have some meaningful investments we want to make in the fourth quarter in marketing, increased awareness in our North American footwear and we just -- and the Olympics. And so we believe that if the business continues and the demand continues to show up as it's been, that there's opportunities in the fourth quarter. But again, we're in the early stages of that inflection point. So we don't know the end of demand at this point.

John Kernan
TD Cowen, Research Division

Got it. And maybe just a quick follow-up on Technical Apparel and the segment margin there was down year-over-year on really impressive top line growth. I think you said there was a timing of government grants that affected the Technical Apparel profitability. Any comments on how you're thinking about fourth quarter and the drivers of operating margin expansion into next year for Technical Apparel?

Andrew Page
Chief Financial Officer, Interim President & CEO of Wilson

Sorry, repeat the last part.

John Kernan
TD Cowen, Research Division

Yes. Any thoughts on the Technical Apparel segment margin in Q4 and then into fiscal '26?

Andrew Page
Chief Financial Officer, Interim President & CEO of Wilson

Yes. Okay. So Technical Apparel margins in Q4, I see those margins are in line. They are relatively strong. We've not -- for the full year, I see those margins being in the low 20s for technical apparel and talk about exceeding margins in the fourth quarter. The timing of the government grants, the point that I was making there is that in the third quarter of last year, we received a higher portion of our government grants than we did this year. And so it created a drag on the third quarter margin this year on a comparable basis.

Your final question comes from the line of Alex Straton from Morgan Stanley.

Alexandra Straton
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I just wanted to focus on the China growth acceleration in the quarter. It definitely stands out versus a more somber narrative from a lot of your peers. So can you just help us square that difference between you and then maybe the broader Sportswear Group and then how you're thinking about industry dynamics in China into the fourth quarter and then next year?

Andrew Page
Chief Financial Officer, Interim President & CEO of Wilson

Okay. Thank you for the question. So I mean, basically, we are quite pleased about the Q3 results in China, and we closed the lineup for the pattern we liked, that we projected in all 3 brands, especially Salomon and Wilson, they're growing extremely well in China market. So I think based on the Q3, we think we got a good level of foundation to finish the whole year in China with a very solid growth.

In Q4, I just want to call out for 2 major seasons sitting in Q4, which is Golden Week and the Double 11. So overall, our overall achievement for these 2 major events are quite satisfied, okay? It's reached above our expectations. And I think pretty much we have a very good confidence for China this year and we will have a very good result in 2025. And so [download] for next year, I think it's the foundation is there. I mean we already mentioned, our 3 major brands, they all got a unique proposition in China, which really attract a lot of younger consumers in different segments. And we are in a very unique position to compete in markets, okay? So we are quite optimistic also for 2026 in China market.
