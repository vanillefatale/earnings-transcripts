Operator

Good day, and welcome to the Conagra Brands Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2026 Earnings Q&A Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Neisius. Please go ahead.

Matthew Neisius
Senior Director of Investor Relations

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Once again, I'm joined this morning by Sean Connolly, our CEO; and Dave Marberger, our CFO. We may be making some forward-looking statements and discussing non-GAAP financial measures during this Q&A session. Please see our earnings release, prepared remarks, presentation materials and filings with the SEC in the Investor Relations section of our website for descriptions of our risk factors, GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations and information on our comparability items.

I'll now ask the operator to introduce the first question.
