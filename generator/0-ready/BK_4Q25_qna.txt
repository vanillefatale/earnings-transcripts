[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.

Ebrahim Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

I guess maybe first question for you, Dermot, on the guidance, especially when we look at the revenue growth, just annualizing your fourth quarter NII gets you to about 9% growth on the NII side. So if you don't mind unpacking that a little bit around, what are the assumptions underpinning that revenue growth outlook and on fees as we think about '26?

Dermot McDonogh
Senior Executive VP & CFO

Okay. So let me start with saying, this year, we're doing it slightly differently. We finished the year with $20.1 billion of revenue, and the performance over the last 3 years has given us confidence to guide top line growth. And as I said in my prepared remarks, the guide that we're giving to you for 2026 is up 5%, plus or minus year-on-year on the top line revenue. Now underneath that, you have both fees and net interest income. And I've said previously that Q4 is a good jumping off point, but December was a particularly strong month for us in NII. So the way I would think -- the way you should think about NII for us this year is a little bit ahead of 5%, fees may be a little bit lower than 5%. So all in, top line growth up 5%.

Ebrahim Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

Understood. That's helpful. And I guess maybe one bigger picture question, just around as we think about the strategic targets and maybe, Robin, your thoughts, I guess the one missing piece here is how would you want The Street to think about, I guess, the medium-term earnings growth potential for BNY. And within that construct, for whatever reason, if the revenue growth environment worsens, your level of confidence in defending the margins and the ROTCE targets that you've upgraded today.

Robin Vince
President, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Sure. So look, I'll take it. It's kind of got 2 parts. I'll take it, both parts of that. But first of all, on the growth targets. Look, we've said all along the positive operating leverage is our North Star. And we've also said that there'll be different components to achieving that in any year. And I think it is important to note that, and that's one of the reasons why, as Dermot just said, we sort of moved to the total revenue guide because we recognize it's sort of a compositional question. But what you should be able to hear from us, certainly, in our prepared remarks, is a bit of an increased conviction inside the company about our ability to win and grow.

And we've certainly been setting internal aggressive sales and revenue targets to be able to do that. But to your question, we're certainly humble about the fact that we've got to be careful around any particular assumptions on market environment. And this is where I come back to the fact that we're all risk managers at heart. We're sort of projecting out a lot of different potential scenarios. And so we take very seriously the fact that we've got to have levers to the extent that the markets might end up disappointing.

And so we created agility in our expense base. And that's been part of our work over the course of the past 3 years. The platforms operating model work, the work that we originally did around some of the efficiency savings, making choices. And the fact that we've now got the rhythm of saying, hey, we could actually make different choices on business development expenses, compensation if needed, the investment book of work. And so this agility is extremely important. But I'll just also recap with a reminder of the fact that we've also deliberately positioned the platforms inside the company and the whole company to trying to reduce the macro sensitivity to the world. And so you've seen that in NII.

We actually specifically called it out in the presentation. But if you look at the different cylinders of the revenue engine of BNY, equity market values, fixed income market values, equity market transaction volumes, fixed income market volumes, government issuance, private sector issuance, capital markets activity, GDP growth, payments, software services, execution and clearing, generally, fixed income and equities. That is all very deliberately positioning ourselves to be able to be more resilient. But then, of course, to your question, to the extent that things happen, we can still react to them. That's how I think about it together.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.

Michael Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

As part of your new hire targets, how much does your thought about tech and AI play into that? And specifically, as it relates to AI, you certainly got our attention. You have over 100 digital employees. How many of those AI digital employees do you expect to have over 3 to 5 years? And what's the savings from them? And again, how does that play into your new hire targets?

Robin Vince
President, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. Thanks, Mike. Look, AI, we think, is super important. We think it's just going to be able to be a catalyst for transformational change. We think that's true for the world. One of the most important evolutions in a technology, frankly, in hundreds of years is the way that we think about it. And so given that it's very hard to project very clearly exactly where we'll be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years from now. And so there's always the risk that we haven't properly and fully incorporated it into our medium-term targets because while we thought about it, it's hard to look into the future that clearly. But the way that we think about AI, and maybe this will be helpful, therefore, is we think that the technology has already gotten to a level where it can have a very significant impact, frankly, on all of us individually and companies, and certainly here at BNY.

And if that follows, then we think it follows that adoption and integration risk becoming the limiting factors. So what we focused on is the real cultural side of it. Making AI for everyone, everywhere and for everything at BNY is our mantra. We launched our AI Hub in 2023. That was just after the ChatGPT moment. We now have an enterprise AI platform, Eliza, that's general intelligence, model-agnostic and it supports this multi-agentic functionality that underpins the digital employees that you referenced. And then we've put in place the resources to support that to really enable the scaling of it. That's all of the GPU compute. We've got our own NVIDIA hardware and tech, but we've also got the collaborations with Google that I mentioned in my prepared remarks in OpenAI and others.

And then the culture point, again, and you'll see this, it sort of resonates through the whole set of transformation and rewiring concepts that we're talking about for the company. It's as true for AI because if AI is this great capability, it's a superpower, it can, therefore, be a capacity multiplier for our people. And so that's what is causing our people to be able to pull AI towards them, hence, the digital employees working side by side with our people. Now it is early days. We will continue to give you mark-to-market in terms of how we're making progress on this. But we are short term enthusiastic, medium term excited and long term believing that it will have a significant positive impact.

Michael Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

That was helpful. So I get it, the enterprise with Eliza scaling, culture, you're excited about it, but could you put a little bit more meat on the bones, if you could, like when you have 134 digital employees today and what does that equate to in savings? And where do you think that number goes to? Or just a little bit more detail, if you could.

Dermot McDonogh
Senior Executive VP & CFO

Mike, it's Dermot here. If you review the materials on Page 6 of our financials presentation, you'll see over the last couple of years that our head count has trended down a little bit, but that's not really anything to do with AI. Yes, we talk about internally, AI is unlocking capacity we don't think about it as in the narrow definition of efficiency. It's all about growing with clients, increasing revenues and optimizing the potential for our employees. So you have to think that over time, AI as a superpower, as Robin just said, is going to increase revenues, create capacity and will allow us to do more with existing resources.

And over the last couple of years we've been doing this right since the get-go in terms of enterprise-wide strategy. We've been quite constrained in our spending, and we've been very disciplined, we continue to spend more on cyber resiliency than we do on AI. So the return for our money is very, very high from what we're getting from the enterprise today. And so we only see upside from here.

We'll move to our next question from Ken Usdin with Autonomous Research.

Kenneth Usdin
Bernstein Autonomous LLP

Guys, I wonder if you can detail a little bit the pretax margin improvement, the 5 points. What business -- can you go through kind of each of the businesses and talk as to how your individual business line pretax margin thoughts are evolving within that too? Like where do we get the most juice?

Dermot McDonogh
Senior Executive VP & CFO

Okay. Thanks for the question. So if you kind of go back to 2023, we delivered in actual performance pretax margin of 30% and ROTCE of 22%. And back then when we initially established the medium-term targets, we went for 33% and 23%. And now we're going with new medium-term targets today of 38% and 28%. So you see real progression there over the last 3 years. And also today, as I mentioned on the first question from Ebrahim, you see us guiding for the first time top line revenue growth. Previously, we guided by business. You will have seen us guide 4 years ago on Securities Services, and we've kind of surpassed that guide.

And so that really speaks to the power of the One BNY transformation that we've been doing over the last 3 years. We have 3 segments: Securities Services; we see upside in Corporate Trust; we see upside in Depositary Receipts. We feel that Asset Servicing, over the last 3 years, has really transformed in terms of growing revenues, taking advantage of efficiencies and driving pretax margin. So that kind of disciplined focus on expenses is allowing us to better price for business to win in Asset Servicing. Market and Wealth Services is the most akin to a platforms at scale that we have at the moment as the rest of the firm matures in the platform operating model.

The pretax margin there is roughly, give or take, around 50%. We would expect to grow that pie at that margin. And so the upside from there on that segment was probably a little bit muted. But in Investment and Wealth Management where we've guided 25% and we finished last year at roughly 17%. That's where we see the most opportunity in '26 and beyond as we kind of begin to see the green shoots of recovery in that segment come back. So One BNY overall delivering for clients, as Robin said in his prepared remarks, 64% increase in clients buying from 3 or more lines of business in the last 3 years, 10% of new logos coming to the firm last year as a percentage of sales. So the clients are noticing what we're doing and want to do more with us.

Robin Vince
President, CEO & Chairman of the Board

And remember, there's a compositional thing here as well, Ken, because if you think about the combination of Corporate Trust, Depositary Receipts, Payments and Trade, CCM and Pershing, which are kind of the platformy businesses that Dermot was talking about, that now represents about 2/3s of the PTI of the company. 3 years ago, that was just 55%. So there's a bit of an averaging here given the fact that that's -- those are the -- that's the segment, MWS and the businesses, they're actually growing the fastest inside the company. So actually as a percentage of the whole, they're growing. And that's a factor here, too.

Kenneth Usdin
Bernstein Autonomous LLP

Yes. Got it. And just to follow-up, Dermot, on your point about how December was a strong month for NII, you guys have done a very good job kind of consistently being conservative about your NII outlook. What would you say about the fourth quarter? Was it deposit balances? Was it pricing? Like, what were the elements that may not run rate forward relative to your exit?

Dermot McDonogh
Senior Executive VP & CFO

So Q4 really was balances held in quite nicely. And we had -- we always say that we don't lead with deposits. And really, NII is an output as a result of franchise activity. And in Q4, we had very strong activity in our Asset Servicing business which caused balances to outperform in the last few weeks of December and that caused the outperformance.

Kenneth Usdin
Bernstein Autonomous LLP

Okay. I would just think that just as you're continuing to push, as you mentioned just before, like why wouldn't that just be a better organic hold on just activity and overall balances.

Dermot McDonogh
Senior Executive VP & CFO

So if you kind of take balances overall, for 2026, we expect balances throughout the course to be roughly flat. Q4 is normally our strongest quarter on balances. Q3 is usually the seasonally slowest and you would expect over the next quarter, couple of quarters to moderate down slightly. When we give you the -- when we think about the 5% plus, it's really around the asset side of the balance sheet where we have securities kind of rolling off and we're reinvesting as a kind of 100 -- 150 basis point pickup. So we kind of -- we've narrowed the range of the cone of outcomes as it relates to interest rate volatility. Balances, we expect to remain roughly in line or flat, and the pickup will come from assets rolling off into higher-yielding securities.

We'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.

Steven Chubak
Wolfe Research, LLC

So Robin, wanted to start with a question on your newly launched tokenized deposit capabilities, and was really hoping you could speak to institutional demand for the offering. What has been some of the early feedback? And as the effort scales over time, how might your monetization approach differ versus some more traditional deposit gathering activities?

Robin Vince
President, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Sure. So look, I just sort of step back from the whole thing because this really is part of the overall digital asset opportunity. We see global financial markets as transforming, moving towards more of an always-on operating model. And we're in the business of moving, storing and managing money. And so we think we're particularly well positioned to connect the traditional and the digital rails to really be able to enable clients. And so our road map has really been, right from the beginning, focus on the innovation, be able to bring the capabilities online.

We did that first with digital asset custody, stablecoin enablement. You just mentioned the tokenized deposits. And so that allows us to be able to serve both the new digital native clients who by the way want the new digital services, but they also want some of the traditional services from us. So we're enabling both with them, and it also allows us with our existing clients to be able to help them to be able to move into this world. So for instance, as a client might want to open up a new share class in parallel to their traditional share classes, maybe they want to open up a tokenized share class, we can do that as well.

So it really is these 2 things working in concert that we think unlocks new possibilities. And we see the value of the improved efficiency, reducing friction that is real value here. And so then when you click in, stablecoins and tokenized deposits are just to become 2 examples of all of that, stablecoins providing the on-chain settlement currency which is very necessary and is frankly because it's their stable value, probably better than some of the other alternatives. And there, of course, there are choices there in the stablecoins.

And then tokenized deposits really improving the internal utilization of cash. And so for a client making a deposit with us, we can actually improve the usability of that deposit, it becomes sort of programmable, if you will. And it allows that money to be able to work harder and faster for them to be able to facilitate other activities and ultimately might, in fact, create the opportunity for clients to be able to do more things with us anchored around some of those types of activities.

Steven Chubak
Wolfe Research, LLC

And for my follow-up, maybe for Dermot, just on the Clearance and Collateral Management business, you've delivered 4 consecutive years of double-digit fee growth in that area, exited this year growing 15%. And just given expectations for a meaningful uptick in Treasury issuance, how does that inform the outlook for the business? Is this double-digit growth rate sustainable? And what are some of the factors that could potentially derail some of the recent momentum?

Dermot McDonogh
Senior Executive VP & CFO

Great question. So the way I would think about this is, as you rightly pointed out, the growth rate over the last couple of years has been quite nice to see. And so we would say the growth rate from here, probably a little bit more modest compared to previous years. We have the Treasury clearing mandate coming in which we expect to kind of influence some of the things that go on there.

So in the U.S., I would say, more Treasury issuance, a little bit more stable than we've seen in the prior couple of years because we kind of -- volumes, et cetera, et cetera, are beginning to moderate. And where we see some of the growth opportunities is outside the U.S. and we've said that on prior calls, where we're continuing to invest in new products and services around the world. So we expect to continue to grow internationally and moderate in the U.S.

We'll take our next question from Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I was hoping to zoom out a little bit and talk about the fee revenue outlook as a whole. You guys updated the organic revenue growth for 2025, which looks like came in at 3%. Some businesses are doing better, some doing a little worse. And the ones where you're seeing strength, particularly things like Securities Services, sounds like that momentum is continuing and then in things that are slower, when I think about like Pershing maybe or Asset Management, there are some idiosyncratic things that you pointed to that should improve. So as you think about organic fee growth into '26 and beyond, any way to frame what that could look like?

Dermot McDonogh
Senior Executive VP & CFO

So thanks for the question, Alex. I really would look at and study Page 6 of our presentation. There are 2 graphs that I particularly like on that page. One is the deeper client relationships where you can see that over the last 3 years we've grown clients who are buying from more than 3 -- 3 or more lines of business has increased by 64%. And then when you pivot over to the middle page, you can see that 2022 flat organic; '23 flat organic; 24% (sic) [ '24 ], 2%; and 2025, 3%. Then that gives us the confidence to be able to guide 5% to the top line of $20.1 billion.

And as I said in an answer to an earlier question, 10% of our sales last year was with new logos. And when you listen to Robin and his answer to the previous question on digital assets, more clients are coming to us because they want thought leadership. And as a consequence of thought leadership in new spaces, Frontier products, we're doing stuff in traditional services. So the short answer to your question is it's the portfolio effect of delivering One BNY to a broad range of clients. Robin said 3 years ago, we have a client list that's the envy of The Street. We pretty much service most of the S&P 500. And so clients are seeing the change that's happening at the company, and they want to do more with us.

So I would say no one business is doing better than the other. Everything has upside, everything has opportunity. As it relates to Pershing specifically, I'm pleased to say that the last couple of years I would have said on most calls the word deconversion due to M&A activity, that's largely behind us which reinforces why we feel confident that we continue to grow now at mid-single digits for net new assets. So we feel good about Pershing and the opportunity that's in front of us there. And also, as I said in the answer to a previous question, we feel we've turned a corner in IWM and '26 is the year that we're going to begin to see the transformation as we've brought that business closer together with BNY.

Robin Vince
President, CEO & Chairman of the Board

And Alex, I'll just add one thing, which is -- and I understand because we've talked about this a bunch over the course of the past couple of years in terms of, okay, where's the growth going to come from? How are you really thinking about it? And we've talked before about the alpha and beta that we see in the overall business model. And so I just want to remind you of the beta point Dermot touched on it related to digital assets. But just remember, there are quite a few megatrends that we think can be quite interesting tailwinds for the company. And so the question is, have we positioned the company in the right way and all of our business platforms to really be able to serve clients as it relates to those various different trends?

So just very briefly to tick through them, capital markets, the growth in capital markets, issuance, trading, movement of assets, think about it, Corporate Trust, our Payments and Trade business, Depositary Receipts, they line up very well with that particular trend, alternatives and our ability to support clients -- alternative clients end-to-end, private market assets, again, Corporate Trust, Asset Servicing, very much playing in that space. Wealth, very important segment. Pershing, Wealth, Investments are all significant players in participating in the growth of that megatrend.

Digital assets which we talked a bunch about already. And that, again, many of our businesses aligned to enabling that. The growth of fixed income, which Dermot touched on, that's relevant, not only in the obvious ways, but also in the financing, private markets, data centers, U.S. Treasury borrowing. And then the big one, outsourcing, clients wanting to focus on what they're really good at and asking us to step in because of the breadth of what we can do to do some of the one-stop shopping being a trusted provider and really giving us that opportunity to serve them more comprehensively. So when you think about that backdrop we have not only the alpha of all of the individual work that we're doing internally, but we're also positioning to be able to take advantage of that. We think the combination of the 2 things is pretty interesting.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Yes. No, I agree there and definitely like the direction where things are going on that Chart 6 or Slide 6. For my follow-up, guys, real quick on the buyback, I don't think I heard you guys talk about the capital return plans for 2026 specifically. And then just broadly, when you think about the growth algorithm at the firm, your medium-term targets, obviously you gave us margins and the return on capital. But as you think about the share repurchases and the total return of capital, how does that play out over the next couple of years?

Dermot McDonogh
Senior Executive VP & CFO

So big picture, Alex, the capital -- our capital philosophy remains unchanged. As you both know, Robin and myself, we like to run to the upper end of our Tier 1 leverage ratio, lot of uncertainty in the markets the last couple of years. The outlook is going to be a little bit uncertain. So we like to kind of be in that kind of 6% ZIP code of Tier 1 leverage ratio. And when you step back from it, what is BNY? It's a capital-light balance sheet with very clean balance sheet, very liquid balance sheet, capital generative. And over time, we've consistently returned earnings to our shareholders.

And so we expect that to continue, and when you kind of solve for the model of what we've guided for 2026, it's going to be consistent. So the buyback number as a percentage is really an output to all the things that we've talked about earlier. So it's going to be in that kind of 95, 105 range. And so we don't really feel that it's necessary to guide on the buyback anymore given the overall algorithm and the model that we have for the future.

Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with BMO Capital Markets.

Brennan Hawken
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

I actually have a question on organic growth as well. And thanks for all the color that you've given. So you generated 3% organic growth last year. Your assumptions and your outlook are that organic growth would accelerate, markets are flat, but yet the fee revenue outlook is sub-5%. So there's kind of 2 possible outputs, conservative outlook or was there some overearning or onetime items that might have elevated the baseline that you're growing off of when we think about 2025 into 2026.

Dermot McDonogh
Senior Executive VP & CFO

So look, organic growth in '26 versus '25, I think if you look -- go back to Page 6 and you see the impact that the commercial model is having, right, on the 2 graphs of organic fee growth and deepening client relationships, the story is quite compelling. And so we continue to hire new talent. The commercial model is not even 2 years old, so we continue to bring in new talent around the world and we continue to raise the ambition of what we want to do with clients across a wide range of services.

So I would expect higher organic growth this year, which reflects the flywheel of the new commercial model and also new product development and the culture that we've kind of changing over the last couple of years at the firm. We haven't really mentioned this, but we have hired a new Chief Product and Innovation Officer who's been with us a little bit over a year, and we would expect a similar impact on the product side of the house that we've had on the commercial side of the house. So we feel quite good about the outlook for organic growth to 2026.

Brennan Hawken
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

No, no. I totally appreciate that. My question is, if the organic growth is going to accelerate, markets are flat, how do we end up with sub-5% fee revenue growth? And correspondingly, if you've got organic growth, I might as well just throw in my follow-up now, why would balances be flat? Don't balances tend to move with organic growth as well? So shouldn't that move with organic growth? Or was there something in the baseline that might cause that -- those 2 metrics to diverge?

Robin Vince
President, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Look, you framed the question at the beginning as were we overearning. We don't think we're overearning. We think we are being thoughtful in the way that we're positioning the outlook for 2026. We see, of course, variability on each of the inputs to the total revenue actually overall line, but we recognize that it could come a little bit more or less with NII. It could come a little bit more or less with the organic fee growth. Of course, no one quite knows what's going to happen with markets, which is why we're sort of making what we think is a reasonable baseline assumption there. So you're doing the math, and we're kind of agreeing with you. We're not quite exactly sure how the composition is going to come, but we feel pretty good about the guide.

Brennan Hawken
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Excellent. Okay. Well, look forward to seeing that organic growth continue to grind higher. So it's a great outcome.

Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.

We'll take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.

Glenn Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I'll just do one small one. We're getting long in the tooth here. So I heard your comments about the deconsolidation in Pershing running its course, and I agree. I just -- taking a step back, there's been a ton of consolidation in the space, except there's also a lot of PE ownership. There's a lot of -- more consolidation to come. And so I'm curious if you've looked underneath the covers to see your book of business and how high up in the table it is, meaning do you service a lot of the consolidators or the consolidatees in the future? Because there's going to be more. And then I worry a little bit about -- not that I agree with it, but in the past, sometimes when they get big enough, they think they can insource and do it themselves. I'm just curious if you could talk a little bit about any part of that.

Dermot McDonogh
Senior Executive VP & CFO

Okay. Thanks for the question, Glenn. I see us playing a very significant role in what is a very big market. We are a $3 trillion player in this space, and we believe we have the products, we have the talent, and we have a right to play in this space. And we've seen that over the last 12 months where we -- and I've said it in our prepared remarks, we've had contract renewals with big players. We've had a couple of breakaway clients in the fourth quarter that we've onboarded, which I said in my script.

And so we feel like we're going to do as well as anybody else in this space, and we have the tools, and the solutions and clients are happy with Wove. They like Wove. We've invested. We've more than 50 clients on that platform now. We continue to grow revenue, and we continue to bring in talent to be able to drive the business forward. And so we kind of think maybe for the next couple of quarters you won't see necessarily the M&A that's been seen in the last few quarters as people are digesting those transactions. And so there has to be a kind of a pause for digesting. And our pipeline is robust and healthy.

Operator

We'll move to our next question from David Smith with Truist Securities.

David Smith
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Your new medium-term targets aren't too far ahead of the adjusted performance of the past quarter. Could you just go into some more details about why you feel like these are sufficiently ambitious given the opportunity set in front of BNY over the next 3 to 5 years? You pretty much hit your targets that you set in January 2024 for your full year 2024 adjusted results. So now I hear you about conservatism and importance for humility across a range of market backdrops. But what -- can you share to show us why the bar has been set high enough for the next few years?

Dermot McDonogh
Senior Executive VP & CFO

Okay, so I was expecting this question, so it's you who gets to ask it. The way I would answer it, if you go to Page 22 of our highlights presentation, when we were at finish '23, pretax margin was at 30% and we went with medium-term targets of 33% and 22% on ROTCE, 23% was the medium-term target. I think you appreciated that ambition and liked the targets, and it was doing it for the first time and said, okay, BNY is kind of raising the bar on itself. So now we closed the year quite strong, and we're going with 38% and 28% for 3 to 5 years out. So again, we're going to say we're going to do that over time through the cycle.

And so a lot of things can go in a different direction. It's going to be nonlinear, and we're raising the bar. Every day, we're trying to outperform that, but we're setting -- maybe think of that as a floor to our ambition and we'd look to outperform it. So we feel like it is stretchy for the firm given where it is in its transformation, and we're always going to look to outperform those targets.

David Smith
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Just as a follow-up, it's great to see the improvement in client relationship depth with clients who work with 3-plus businesses up 64% versus 2 years ago. Can you give us any sense of the number in absolute figures? Is it a single-digit percent who use 3 or more businesses at BNY right now? Is the majority? Is it somewhere in between? Where do you want this to get to over the medium term?

Dermot McDonogh
Senior Executive VP & CFO

So one of the things that I haven't said is, last year we had 2 individual record sales quarters. So I would say it's all across the firm. And we've had 3 consecutive years of year-on-year growth in core fee sales. And so when you look about that in the context of a commercial model that's not even 2 years old, then you have to feel optimistic about the future. 60% of new (sic) [ growth in ] clients buying from 3 or more lines of business and 10% of sales in 2025 were clients that are new to BNY. And that is some of the points that Robin made about the new products where clients are coming to us for thought leadership.

And while they're with us and talking to us, they're doing traditional services. And we've seen an increase, a 20% increase in annual sales productivity. So I think the hustle and energy within our commercial organization is possible and clients really want to talk to us about doing more with us. And also, the last point I'd make on this is, over the last 3 years, we've roughly spent $0.5 billion each year investing in the firm and providing improved client service, improved solutions, improved product. And you can see that particularly showing up if I was to pick one business or one segment. You see it showing up in Securities Services, which is really where we've really outperformed on the margin. And so we see a real flywheel of momentum there, and we expect that to continue in the forward.

Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.

Gerard Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Robin, can you give us a bigger picture? You guys have obviously put up very strong organic growth numbers and that's the focus. But when you think about opportunities to grow through acquisitions or inorganic growth, is there any areas that have an interest to you? I know you've done a small deal a couple years ago and all the focus, again, has been on organic, which has been fabulous. But what about inorganic or acquisitions? How do you think about that?

Robin Vince
President, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Sure, Gerard. So look, let me just start with just bringing you back to our remarks because I do think this is a very important context for M&A because there are a lot of different reasons why folks can do M&A, and one of them is obviously when they absolutely need to go do something because they've run out of runway themselves in some respect. And I think our headline is that our organic transformation is working and has started to show tangible results, and we think we've got strong momentum and the runway to create more value here for clients and therefore for shareholders over the near, medium and long term.

We're certainly open-minded about inorganic opportunities if they can accelerate, derisk or enhance our value proposition. But we do feel that we have a lot of optionality here because we've got the momentum from what we're already doing. We feel good about that organic path. And so we don't have any pressure to do M&A. And that's very important because we think that when you look out and see the reasons why various different folks do M&A, it's not always for the best reasons. And so that optionality, we think, is a very real thing.

Now in terms of the philosophy, there's no change to it. So M&A, if done well, can be a powerful tool in the toolkit. We're certainly open to things. We look -- Dermot said this before, ever since last summer when there were all these rumors in the market, we've had a lot of bankers calling us with inorganic opportunities. So we see the flow, and we're in touch with it, which is good. But for us, it's going to be about good discipline, alignment with strategic priorities, strong cultural fit, attractive financial returns, and the bar is definitely high. It would have to make a lot of sense because as I said, we don't feel like we need to do it, but that's sort of collectively how we think about it.

Gerard Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Very good. And just to tie into that, in the markets you operate, what are the markets that are the most robust? Is it domestic U.S.? Is it Europe, Asia? Because obviously you're global, you've got a good feel for that. Where are you guys seeing the best growth and the best opportunities for growth?

Robin Vince
President, CEO & Chairman of the Board

It's interesting. This is going to sound like I'm not going to give you a satisfactory answer to the question because it really is all of the above. The U.S. is the biggest market that we operate in. If you want the split, it's approximately 40% outside of the U.S. so we feel like we've got a good global balance, but the U.S. obviously has got a lot of opportunity for us and a lot of our platforms have seen the growth. But actually, last year, the fastest growing in percentage terms region was actually Asia. So clearly, there's opportunity there as well.

And I would say historically in Europe we might have been a little bit under-penetrated so that there's real opportunity there as well. So I wouldn't really break the opportunity down on geographic lines. And as Dermot said, we don't really break it down on business lines either because we see opportunity and pathway in each one of the businesses, albeit for very different reasons, and that really ties back to this point about the different things going on in the market, these megatrends, whether it's capital markets, private markets, et cetera, that I talked about before.

So this is a critical part of how we're thinking about the company. We are deeply invested in making the company work more effectively, the agility, the platforms operating model in terms of how we run the place. We've deeply invested in the commercial model so that we can actually get more and more out of the businesses that we have, this great breadth of businesses to deliver to clients, including in more combinations and more solutions, which is exciting. Dermot mentioned product and innovation, that's exciting because that's about new products in the same way, as you mentioned, new logos earlier on. And so all of those things come together for us, we think, to be able to drive opportunity, which is one of the reasons why when we sit and look at what we have, going back to the beginning of the answer to your question on M&A, we feel like we've just got a lot of opportunity with what we've got to make more of it.

Gerard Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Very good. And then, Dermot, a quick question on Slide 6, as you referred to one of your favorite graphs, the deeper client relationship graph. I don't think you mentioned this, but if you did, I apologize. What percentage of the customers are now taking more than 3 products or 3 businesses? Or are you -- is there still enormous room for this to continue to grow at this rate because you just haven't deeply penetrated all of the customer base at this level?

Dermot McDonogh
Senior Executive VP & CFO

So I would say a lot more room for improvement. It's a momentum. It's a cultural transformation. It's a de-siloing of the firm. In some ways, we're kind of turning a page here today on Phase 1 to Phase 2, but the work is never done. And so we think there is more upside, more training, deeper integration of the businesses. We kind of like -- if I just give you one specific example, Asset Management can do a lot more with Pershing than what it does today. Asset Management can do a lot more with Asset Servicing than it kind of does today. And the leadership of those 3 businesses are beginning to see that opportunity. We have great manufacturing capability in Asset Management. We need to deliver that to the rest of the firm and their BNY clients.

We'll take our next question from Emily Ericksen with Citigroup.

Emily Ericksen
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I wanted to ask first on the expense side of things, you're guiding to 3% to 4% for '26. So take the midpoint of that comes in somewhere near where you guys printed for '25. But we're talking about flat markets, right, from year-end. Is the way I kind of square, I guess, that difference is some of the market-related uplift to expenses expected to kind of recede the balance between what you're able to harvest in efficiency savings relative to the incremental investments, the $500 million from '25, how should I think about that particular balance on the expense side of things into '26?

Dermot McDonogh
Senior Executive VP & CFO

So I'm looking at Page 21 of the financial presentation, Emily. And look, for the first time this year, previously, we've guided some operating leverage and positive operating leverage. Today, we're coming out and saying it's going to be greater than or equal to 100 basis points. And over the last few years, I think we've managed to establish some credibility that we are very good stewards of our expense base, very good financial discipline, and we've harvested roughly $500 million a year for each of the last 3 years, and we've reinvested that in the business to grow.

And so it's really about the 3% to 4% guide for 2026 is that continued investment in the business, in a very agile and dynamic way, which gives us then the confidence to be able to guide to the top line growth of 5%. So it all starts with top down, where we kind of say we want to solve and deliver positive operating leverage to you. And then as a consequence of that, in the budget season, then we're going to go through the bottoms up planning analysis and we arrive at this model that gives us this flex on the expense side.

Emily Ericksen
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Got it. Okay. And then just on the NII side of things, you've talked about breaking out that 5% on total revenue a little better if we look just at the NII piece. How much of that or can you sort of walk through the drivers of where NIM goes from here? I know you have the reinvestment impact on the security side of things, but you also pointed to some deposit margin compression in 4Q. Is there room for significant NIM expansion to support that 5% plus on the NII side?

Dermot McDonogh
Senior Executive VP & CFO

So I'm not too sure what your definition of significant is, but I would expect over the course of 2026 for NIM to grind higher from where it is today.
