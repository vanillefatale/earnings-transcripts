[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.

Glenn Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Great thoughts and detail in there. One narrow one first. I guess I'll ask it simply. How do you plan to scale wealth from here? And I want to include in that, if you could, your aspirations, meaning we had a little experiment with United Capital, but like you're amazing in ultra-high net worth, and I'm curious about the rest of wealth. You've done a couple of things in RIA land. So maybe we could talk about that and then zoom out after that.

David Solomon
Chairman & CEO

Sure. And I appreciate the question, Glenn. I think our ultra-high net worth franchise is extraordinary. I think we have a leading position here in the United States, strong position but, obviously, with room for more share in footprint in Europe and in Asia. But I think it's a highly differentiated offering for wealthy individuals and people that have very, very complex needs from a wealth perspective. That business scales with people, you heard -- and technology. But you heard in our remarks that we're continuing to invest in broadening the footprint and the coverage available on the resources to expand that ultra-high net worth footprint.

As you point out, we did do an experiment with United Capital, but we've reached the conclusion that the right way for us, given our manufacturing capability in asset management to really explore broader access to wealth is through third-party wealth channels. And so I think you know we're making very significant investments in our third-party wealth capability. That includes partnerships with RIAs and footprint with RIAs. And we have great product manufacturing capability. We can use others' distribution very, very effectively given our brand and our very, very complete diverse product offering, and that will help us continue to scale.

But in direct full-service wealth, we're going to stick with ultra-high net worth wealth. And what's interesting is, obviously, you've got a bunch of secular things going on that are growing the available people that need these services. You have a huge generation of wealth transfer that's going on that's bringing a whole new generation in these services, and it's a very fragmented business, and we think we have a very differentiated offering with lots of upside. And look, you heard what we said about our capabilities in wealth, and our target is to continue to grow those long-term fee-based wealth assets by 5% as we go forward.

Glenn Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I appreciate all that, David. Bigger picture, obviously, really strong results, good backdrop. Middle of the range despite all these strong results, because I think there's mixed operating leverage where people always want more operating leverage during big market peaks. So I'm going to flip the comment around and just ask, what's your level of confidence you've raised the floor with everything that you've laid out and everything you've executed on? Because in the past when markets pull back off highs, returns for you and others would drift back to the like low double digits and sometimes a little bit lower, but like I guess I'm curious on how much you think, with all that progress you've built, how much have you raised the floor?

David Solomon
Chairman & CEO

I think we've raised the floor -- I think we've raised the floor meaningfully based on the work we've done, the growth that we've done. In particular, the growth of durable revenues, which will be less effective, not effective but less effective, if we get into some sort of a downturn or a more challenging environment. If you step back to our Investor Day, the firm's returns in the 10 years before our Investor Day averaged 9-and-change percent. And so I think we now are operating with a Global Banking & Markets franchise that should run mid-teens through the cycle. That doesn't mean you couldn't get a very tough environment where it runs lower, but you can also get environments, and this is part of what we've said about 2026, where it has the potential to run higher. But I think we've uplifted the floor very significantly.

Now of course, in very severe downturns, it slows down activity, it impedes confidence. But I just think the firm is bigger, more diversified, much more durable and better positioned when we have that kind of environment than we've been before. I'm not going to predict the future and I know it's never a straight line, but I think we've uplifted it very materially.

We'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.

Ebrahim Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

I guess maybe just sticking with the through-cycle ROE, David, maybe the other end of the spectrum, when I talk to investors, just given where the stock is trading, given the performance you had, and 2 structural things seem to be happening at Goldman Sachs. One is, obviously, the regulatory backdrop changing is creating more capital flex, and the productivity focus that you had doubled down with the Goldman Sachs 3.0, is it fair for a shareholder to assume that, absent like big, big peaks and troughs, that the business is rebasing to maybe something better than mid-teens returns towards closer to high teens? Or is that sort of misplaced and misunderstanding kind of the business dynamics?

David Solomon
Chairman & CEO

I appreciate the question. And look, our goal is going to continue to be to work very, very hard to do everything we can to continue to take the returns higher. We were very pointed in our comments on the last slide in that presentation that we're reaffirming our mid-teens target. I certainly remember it is not that many quarters ago where many people on this call would ask questions about how we were going to get to mid-teens. So we've arrived. I think we were pointed in saying this is an environment where the potential to be positioned to exceed targets in the near term is there. But as the previous set of questions just pointed out, there'll be other environments where there could be headwinds. So I think we're very comfortable that we are operating as a mid-teens firm. We think that we can do things that, over time, will drive upside to that. But we're not going to set targets until we're very comfortable that we further elevated the firm.

I think one of the most important things coming out of the presentation is the next step in our asset wealth management journey to tell you that given the work we've done and the progress we've made, we now have more confidence that we can operate that business at a higher margin, 30%, which drives a higher return. And so we're comfortable putting that target out. And that, of course, elevates the overall performance of the firm.

The other thing I just want to highlight, that comes out of your comment, is people think about the regulatory environment as changing the capital rules and giving us more capital flexibility. But I'd also highlight the regulatory environment over the last 5 years put costs and burdens on the firm that we now won't have going forward that actually gives us flexibility to invest over time in other things that drive growth. So it's not just the capital stuff that's important; it's also the fact that we and others in the industry were burdened by additional costs that now can be directed to what I'd call more productive growth and return for our clients and for our shareholders.

Ebrahim Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

That's great. And I guess maybe a second one just on capital deployment. So it's very clear the bar for M&A is high. But when you think about the stock valuation today, the regulatory backdrop, there is a cycle or an environment where there is room to do something transformational. Just give us a sense in terms of, do you see this as the right time or, if the right opportunity presents itself, to do something that would shift the mix, boost the mix of AWM business a lot more? Or do you think that's kind of anti Goldman's DNA to do something that would be too large a transformational?

David Solomon
Chairman & CEO

I appreciate the question, Ebrahim, but I'm going to be very consistent with what I've said multiple times with this question. We very -- we feel very good about what we did in 2025, the T. Rowe partnership and the 2 small acquisitions. They fill in gaps, they accelerate our journey in Asset & Wealth Management. But the bar for doing something significant and transformational is very, very high. And it has to be. One, because there are very few really, really great, large businesses. Most of them are not for sale and available. And I think the cultural aspects of Goldman Sachs and what makes Goldman Sachs unique and different, there has to be a tremendous sensitivity to integrating businesses into it to make sure that Goldman Sachs can continue to be Goldman Sachs.

And so I won't say that we don't look at those things and think about those things, but really my key message is the bar is very high. I do think that we will see other things like the things that we've done that can accelerate our journey and, therefore, increase the growth trajectory of the Asset & Wealth Management business.

We'll take our next question from Erika Najarian with UBS.

L. Erika Penala
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I hate framing this question this way, but I can't think of a better way to frame it. In terms of the capital market cycle ahead, what inning are we in? And as investors think about the scale of potential upside to Goldman, maybe compare and contrast the preconditions that you see for the capital markets backdrop in 2026 with 2021. And I'm only asking this question as investors try to think about the EPS potential of your company, and I think 2021 is sort of seen as like a ceiling in terms of what you could produce in this business.

David Solomon
Chairman & CEO

I'll give you a couple of things, Erika, to think about, and I appreciate the question. The first thing I'd just say as a student of these businesses for decades and decades and decades I would bet you that 2021 is not the ceiling. That doesn't mean that in this cycle we surpass 2021, because things can change and things can go wrong. But this business, when you go back and you step out and you look over 25, 30 years, there's not a ceiling that hasn't then been exceeded at some point down the road as you run through cycles. And I'm sure, given the growth in market capital world and activity, the 2021 activity levels will be exceeded again. They might be exceeded in 2026.

There was a slide that my team was showing me that shows a range of outcomes, including a conservative outcome for M&A, a base outcome for M&A and a bull outcome for M&A. And the base outcome is pretty close to 2021 and the bull outcome is ahead of 2021. I think the world is set up at the moment to be incredibly constructive in 2026 for M&A and capital markets activity. And I think the likely scenario is it is a very, very good year for M&A and capital markets activity.

What could change that? Something could go on in the world, some sort of an exogenous event or a macro event that changes the sentiment. If you look at 2025, we saw that in April for a period of time and things got slowed down. I don't think that's the likely outcome, but it's certainly in the distribution as a possibility. But I do think that we are not yet in the middle of the potential for a full-on M&A and sponsor cycle. And I think over the next few years, barring some sort of an exogenous event that slows it down, we're going to have a pretty constructive environment for those activities given the combination of fiscal, monetary, capital investment, deregulatory stimulus, you've got this combination of stimulus activity that I think is pretty constructive for these businesses.

Denis Coleman
Chief Financial Officer

Erika, a couple of things I'd add on just to supplement everything David said. If you look at sort of industry-wide volumes in the various categories of investment banking activities, compare it to the last 5 years, a number of them have started to trend above the average level. One that's decidedly below the averages remains the IPO business for equities. That's a lucrative business that we have a very long-standing leadership position in.

And it's also the case that while some of the debt activities have been trending up in terms of overall volumes, we still haven't seen enormous volumes of sponsor capital committed deals or large cap capital committed investment-grade activity. So there still remains other types of transaction activity as we progress through the cycle that is very strategic to clients, things that Goldman Sachs is very good at executing, that could further propel upside across the capital markets line items.

L. Erika Penala
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Great. And just the follow-up question is, I really appreciate how you laid out your internal opportunities to deploy the capital, your excess capital, which is so much, right? If you take into account the excess, your buffer and potentially the redefinition of that capital. As we think about a year where -- you talked about the cap markets, your ability to organically generate capital is also best-in-class. How do we think about how that buyback fits in? I appreciate your prepared remarks that you're going to be opportunistic. You did $12 billion in '26 (sic) [ '25 ], but it seems like you have plenty of room to meet or exceed that and check off your wish list. Is that the right way to think about it?

Denis Coleman
Chief Financial Officer

Sure, Erika. So I'll quickly give you our standard answer on the prioritization of the deployment of capital, and that remains unchanged, as David said. And that's what we'll focus on, first and foremost. But to get to your buyback question. Given the degree of excess capital that we sit with today and our expectation that we'll continue to generate capital over the course of the next year, buybacks remain an important tool in our toolkit. Over the long term, you will notice that Goldman Sachs has reduced its share count quite significantly and quite sustainably, and it gives us leverage to continue to generate EPS growth.

So like anyone, we are mindful of the price at which our equity is trading, but we're also trying to take a strategic long-term approach to, first and foremost, fuel the franchise to support client activity, but also drive returns for shareholders over multiple years. So buybacks will continue to feature as an important part of our capital deployment strategy.

We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.

Betsy Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just continuing on this theme, I wanted to understand a little bit about how the equities markets revenues and the fixed income revenues are aligned with the issuance calendar. Just wondering how much of the issuance that's going on is helping those 2 line items as well? Or is issuance all within banking?

Denis Coleman
Chief Financial Officer

So thank you for the question, Betsy. I'm not sure I understood the very last tail end of your question, but maybe I'll start off answering it and then you can redirect me. I think across our FICC and equity businesses, we obviously have a very diversified portfolio of activities, both intermediation and financing. Even with intermediation, diversified by asset class, by cash, derivatives and equities. And I think there are contributions that the primary market activity makes to enhance the overall liquidity provision, secondary market making opportunity set.

But my own view is that we'll continue to see an increase in the overall level of capital markets activity. And if that pulls through as well as we hope and expect, that should catalyze incremental levels of activity across intermediation activities as investors even more dynamically work to assess their existing secondary market portfolio versus "making room for primary," et cetera. So I think there remains opportunity in that front as we move into 2026.

Betsy Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And then you mentioned that your backlog today is the highest in 4 years. Maybe we could just ask you to unpack a little bit. There's a lot of different backlog. So would you mind going through what you're anticipating getting on released into production, so to speak, as we go through '26?

Denis Coleman
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So the way -- we report our backlog consistently each and every quarter, so there's no change to the way we're reporting that. It's comprised of our advisory activities, our debt underwriting, our equity underwriting. We're very, very deliberate in our disclosures each and every quarter to highlight if the deltas in the backlog have particular drivers. In this particular case, we say a couple of things. We say its seventh consecutive quarter. It's the highest in 4 years, it's one of the highest levels ever. It is a large level of backlog. And we make that point because, obviously, the results that we just delivered in Q4 and for full year 2025 were very strong. But the indication is that not only have we delivered those results, but more than replenished those results. And so that is what's giving us the confidence.

And then all of David's comments that he made with respect to the flywheel and the catalyzing of activity, because the growth in the backlog is driven by advisory, we're also trying to give our investors the sense that, that could in turn drive other pieces of activity across the firm, other types of activity that doesn't get registered in backlog and doesn't lend itself to that type of reporting metric. So that's sort of our orientation and that's what I would offer up to help you get the insight on why we're putting that out there and highlighting it.

We'll take our next question from Brennan Hawken with BMO.

Brennan Hawken
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

First of all, sort of great timing on the Apple Card deal, like I mean that's announced the week before we get the tweet on the limits. I mean I couldn't help but chuckle about that. I'd love to hear about -- obviously, you've got a long pathway to close, 24 months and then it closes. But could you help us maybe understand the right way we should be thinking about like platforms run rate after it closes, and then whether or not there's any operating expenses given this is your last card exit that might be running off? And what are the plans for the deposits, the Apple deposits, that may not have been reflected in the announcement?

Denis Coleman
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. Brennan, thank you for the question. Thank you for the observation. The same thing occurred to us. So thinking about Platform Solutions on the forward, it's really comprised, the vast majority of it is the Apple Card business and the savings program. The loans are now obviously in a fair value standpoint from an accounting perspective, so they're mark-to-market. The performance contributors will obviously be NII, charge-offs, operating expenses, et cetera.

I think we'd observed from a seasonality perspective and across the balance of the year perspective the same dynamics we've observed over the last couple of years with the portfolio, where the first quarter is typically stronger in terms of reflecting paydown of balances and things like that, which then, generally speaking, grow over the balance of the year. When you put that all together, our expectation is we'll have a small pretax loss for the year in the segment, but nothing that's material for Goldman Sachs.

David Solomon
Chairman & CEO

You asked also, Brennan, about -- you asked also about savings. I just wanted to comment on this. So there currently is no agreement to transition the savings program. We're going to continue to service and maintain our existing Apple Savings customers, and we're going to continue to offer them high-yield savings accounts as Apple Card users. And users should expect that this service will be seamless, it will be uninterrupted and they'll continue to earn the same competitive rate they've been getting on the Savings, and it's attractive to us.

Obviously, we are very focused on the transition of the card, and there's a lot of work to do over the next 24 months to transition of the card. But at some point in the future, we will expect to have additional conversations about the future of Apple Savings. As we've mentioned, our deposits are diversified in tenor and channel, and that remains true even if we excluded Apple Savings deposits, they're just a small fraction of the deposits. But at this point, there have been no discussions about the Savings plan.

Brennan Hawken
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Got it. For my follow-up, so one of the sort of debate points this morning with investors was on the efficiency ratio and how things looked year-over-year. Now of course, you have to adjust for the revenue impact of the Apple Card announcement. But -- and I might be doing the math wrong, but -- so correct me if that's the case. But when I do make that adjustment, it looks like there's a negative year-over-year impact on the efficiency ratio, like it was -- the efficiency ratio was stronger last fourth quarter versus this fourth quarter. Is my math right? And if so, could you speak to maybe what some of the factors were that prevented greater operating leverage, and how we should think about operating leverage going forward?

Denis Coleman
Chief Financial Officer

Sure, Brennan. I'll start with that. So first, thank you for observing correctly that the efficiency ratio is one of those places where based on the accounting for the Apple Card transition, it goes in the opposite direction versus our intention and the trajectory that we've been on. So that does explain why it's going in that direction based on the reduction to revenues. But you need to look at the efficiency ratio on a full year basis. There have been some other things I've seen where people are looking at quarter -- year-over-year fourth quarter operating expenses or efficiency.

Given the way that we manage compensation and noncompensation expenses over the course of the full year, you need to look at that sort of in totality. And in this particular, when you do that for the year-over-year fourth quarter look, in this particular year, it looks like you have a significant increase in operating expenses. But when you step back and look at the full year performance, it's very clear that the firm delivered significant operating leverage. Obviously, we have reported revs at plus 9%, we have pretax at plus 19% and we have EPS at 27%. And so you have to sort of step back, take account of the provision release and look at the full year results.

David Solomon
Chairman & CEO

The fourth quarter year-over-year, the only thing I'd add, the fourth quarter year-over-year was affected by the way we accrued comp last year and the way we accrued comp this year and the revenues in the quarter. And so you can't look at the fourth quarter year-over-year. To Denis' point, you have to look at the year.

We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.

Michael Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I guess it's an exciting time. This is a new era for Goldman Sachs, Goldman Sachs 3.0. And you're redesigning the whole firm around AI, so that could be very exciting. But I'm looking for the output that you're looking for from this. I know it's early days. But whenever I ask about AI, it's always answers at a 10,000-foot level. Like it's transformational, it's a game changer, it's a super power. We all get that. But what are you hoping to achieve? Like this decade, your revenues were up 2/3, your headcount is up 1/4. So that's one way maybe you could frame the output that you like to achieve. But how much more in revenues, how much more efficiency? Can you put some meat on the bones?

David Solomon
Chairman & CEO

I appreciate the question, Mike, and I appreciate the way you frame it, and I understand why there's -- there's a strong desire to get more from us. And what I promise you is you're going to get more over time as we're in a position to give you metrics, to give you targets and to really explain it. I want to step back at a high level. Just the one thing that I'd say, and I'd frame it slightly differently than you'd frame it, this is not a new era for Goldman Sachs, One GS 3.0. We're not going to transform the whole firm with AI. We are focused on our 2 core businesses, driving growth in our 2 core businesses and both, I think, we're incredibly well positioned and positioned to win.

AI and the technology is an opportunity for us to drive productivity and efficiency in the organization, and we are very, very focused on it, because it will add to our capacity to invest in growth in the business. At a high level, and I think I talked about this a little bit before, there are 2 things that I would focus on. One, we have very smart, very productive people, and you can give them these models, these tools, these applications, you can put them in their hands, and they're very good at playing with them and figuring out how on a day-to-day basis they can use these tools to make themselves more productive, to do more, to affect our clients more. And we're pretty good at that. We put technology in their hands for decades. They're pretty good taking that technology and figuring out how to use it. And that is going on and there is progress in that.

The thing you're talking about is our ability to really, in the enterprise, deploy the technology to reimagine operating processes and create real efficiency. And we think there is an ability to do that on a basis that would be meaningful and significant for Goldman Sachs. It's not just to take cost out, but it's also to free up capacity to invest in other areas where we see growth opportunities that we've been a little bit constrained.

I talked about wealth management because somebody asked the question and our desire to put more feet on the ground to broaden our footprint and our platform, we would like to do more of that this year than we're doing but we're constrained because we're also trying to balance and deliver returns. If we can remake processes and create more operating efficiency and flexibility, that will free up more capacity from an efficiency perspective to invest in these growth areas.

To change operating processes in the firm, and we've identified 6 specific processes that we're attacking, takes an enormous amount of work to bring people along. We started doing this in the fall. We're making good progress. To be honest, I had hoped to give a little bit more transparency at this earnings call, but we don't have the full confidence to put information out publicly. But we are committed to giving you more over the course of the next quarters so you can track with us the efficiency progress and how we're deploying that progress into the business. And so we'll continue to keep you posted as we do it. But I think it's meaningful, but for the moment, it's focused on 6 distinct processes.

Michael Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And just as one follow-up, if we were to look at one metric for progress 5 years from now, would that be like revenues per employee? Would that be efficiency? Would it be headcount? Or how do you think about that?

David Solomon
Chairman & CEO

Well, if you look out 5 years from now, I think this technology -- and I think this has to be put in the lens of a journey that a firm like ours has been on for decades. I mean I joined Goldman Sachs in 1999 on a revenue per employee basis. I mean you pointed out a revenue per employee metric over the last 5 years, you go back and you look at 25 years, you know the same thing. We continue -- our people continue to get more productive. I think the technology and the work we can do in One GS 3.0 creates an ability for us in the next 5 years to accelerate the pace of that once again. And so that is a metric, but I don't think the only metric.

We'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.

Steven Chubak
Wolfe Research, LLC

So David, there have been a number of significant developments in the area of market structure, whether it's tokenization, the recent expansion of prediction markets. You guys are always quite front-footed when it comes to innovation. And I was hoping you could speak to how you're evaluating some of these emerging opportunities within the market structure, tokenization landscape. Where do you see the most compelling opportunities for Goldman and how are you positioning the firm to participate in a more meaningful way?

David Solomon
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So I appreciate the question, Steven. First, I'll start, I mean, you mentioned 2 things and the both things that we have an enormous number of people in the firm extremely focused on. Tokenization, stablecoins, obviously, there's a lot going on in Washington right now with The Clarity Act. I was actually in Washington on Tuesday speaking to people about things that we think are important to us in the context of framing of that. Obviously, that bill, based on the news over the last 24 hours, has a long way to go before that bill is going to progress. But I do think these innovations are important. I don't think we have to be the leader, but it would not surprise you that we have a big team of people spending a lot of time with senior leadership and doing a lot of work so that we can clearly decide where we're investing and playing and how those technologies can expand or accelerate a variety of our existing businesses and where there are new business opportunities, candidly, around those technologies.

I think the prediction markets are also super interesting. I've personally met with the 2 big prediction companies and their leadership in the last 2 weeks and spent a couple of hours with each to learn more about that. We have a team of people here that are spending time with them and are looking at it. When you think about some of these activities, particularly when you look at some of the ones that are CFTC regulated, they look like derivative contract activities. And so I can certainly see opportunities where these cross into our business.

And we're very focused on understanding that, understanding the regulatory structure that's going to develop around that, seeing where there are opportunities for us to have capabilities or to partner to serve our clients around these. I think it's early on both. I think sometimes the -- I think there's a lot of reason to be excited and interested in these things, but the pace of change might not be as quick and as immediate as some of the pundits are talking about in both of these. But I think they're important and real, and we're spending a lot of time.

Steven Chubak
Wolfe Research, LLC

And just a quick follow-up on the financing opportunity. If I think back 5-plus years ago ahead of the 2020 Investor Day, when you first started talking about the financing opportunity, you noted it was less than 20% of Goldman's trading revenue, it was 40% at some of your larger money center peers and that you were planning to narrow that gap. And if I fast forward to today, you're now approaching that 40% threshold. I was hoping to get your thoughts on how large you think that financing piece can grow over time, and your approach also managing risk against any potential drawdown or deleveraging events within that business.

David Solomon
Chairman & CEO

Yes. No, it's a very good question, Steven, and you're focused on the right thing and so are we. I mean, I think what I would say is over the last 5 years, we've gone from being underweighted given our market footprint and our market shares and our wallet shares to being more closely weighted. I think we've got a little bit of room. But it wouldn't surprise you in the formation of the Capital Solutions Group and thinking about the connectivity between our asset management business and our origination capabilities, we see the potential to basically put a lot of this activity over time into our asset management business and allow our clients to have access to these origination flows.

And so we're very conscious from a risk management perspective. We see opportunities to continue to serve our clients. But because of our asset management business, we have the ability to grow this, and not all of it has to be on balance sheet in the same way. And so we're keenly focused on the evolution of that in the coming years, and that's something you'll hear us talk more about.

We'll take our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.

Daniel Fannon
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Another one just on expenses and really noncomp and all you've been doing with the GS 3.0. I was curious as you start 2026, how does the growth for noncomp look versus maybe 2025 in the budgeting process? And maybe what's different in terms of some of those metrics?

Denis Coleman
Chief Financial Officer

So I appreciate the question. You've heard us say over many, many years, we maintain a rigorous focus on managing these expenses as tightly as we possibly can. There are a lot of them, certainly by dollar quantum, that are very linked with the overall level of activity inside of the firm, notably, transaction-based expenses and also to an extent some of the market development expenses.

We're at a point in the cycle where, as an example, it's more important to feed some T&E capacity into the firm to get people front-footed and meeting face-to-face with clients than it is to overly constrain that expenditure. Transaction-based, similarly, as we continue to grow these activities, there are necessarily transaction-based expenses that go alongside those. On the other side of the equation are those types of expenses over which we have more control, and we have a very concerted effort to constrain the growth of fees, which may be inflation-linked or maybe substitutes for other types of work. And we're focused on sort of grinding those down as much as we possibly can.

Daniel Fannon
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

And as a follow-up, for the private banking and lending, I was hoping to get an updated outlook as you think about 2026, in a backdrop where rates are coming down, how you're thinking about the offsets of revenue from both demand and deposits.

Denis Coleman
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So there, we've obviously been quite deliberate trying to make sure you have all the pieces of the puzzle. As we head into 2026, we've dealt with some of the sequential comparisons in that line item based on the one particular loan that had been previously impaired and then we had exceptional levels of revenue, we want to understand that as a comparison. That frankly will still be relevant as we head into 2026.

Our focus is continuing to grow lending activities and the lending penetration. We made good progress there. That's a piece of unlocking incremental growth in the wealth channel, remains very important to clients. So we expect to grow lending. We focus on growing our overall level of deposit activity across the segment. But we do expect there could be some NIM compression given our expectations on the rate cycle, and so we just want to flag that as an expectation as we head to 2026.

We'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.

Matthew O'Connor
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I was hoping to follow up on the 5% long-term asset flow target within wealth. You were slightly above this in 4Q. And I just wanted to get more color in terms of how you arrived at that and maybe framing how much is doing more with existing advisers and customers versus the efforts that you have to hire more advisers and presumably attract new customers?

Denis Coleman
Chief Financial Officer

So look, we think wealth is a big opportunity for the firm. We have a very strong business at the moment. We think there's a good opportunity to grow it. And we are making extra efforts to drive accountability and focus on our execution against that opportunity set. And so this is an external target that we expect you all to hold us to account.

And we also think it's an important signal to send to all of our people in terms of how laser-focused we are on this opportunity set. As you said, we have a track record of delivering this type of annual growth. So we want to maintain the focus. That is one component of the overall sort of revenue equation and opportunity set in wealth management. But it's an effort for us to just apply incremental amounts of granular focus. This is one of the key underpinnings for the overall revenue trajectory in the wealth business.

Matthew O'Connor
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And any color you want to provide in terms of -- when you talked about growing advisers, you've got some planned this year. You said you'd like to do more, but you're mindful of kind of managing the profitability. Just any way of framing whether it's your plan this year or just kind of longer term, where you're at now and where you'd like to be on the number of advisers?

David Solomon
Chairman & CEO

I think the best way, Matt, I think the best way to frame it, this is a very fragmented business. My guess is in ultra-high net worth, our share in the United States, for example, is somewhere mid-single digits, and that's probably leading share. So you think about there are hundreds and hundreds of firms and people that do this in a variety of ways. So with our franchise and our platform, I said before earlier in the call, it scales with people. There is lots of ability to still grow market share in this business if you've got a leading franchise by adding advisers, adding footprint, broadening the clients that we touch. And so we think we've got a good trajectory to do that. And there's a real focus on that.

Denis Coleman
Chief Financial Officer

I'd add too, alts is a component of it. We put out specific targets around sort of alts opportunity set. And while we obviously have penetration of alts within our clients, given that the average wealth of a client on our platform is north of $75 million, it's not only appropriate, but you could advise a distribution of exposure to alternatives and there's still probably opportunity to grow that with our clients. So in addition to the footprint, the advisers, the mix of their activities, lending remains an opportunity there. And we do -- as we've mentioned, we see more opportunities to enhance our technology investment, the digital experience for those clients and ensure that we're very well positioned with the existing clients and their successors.

We'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital.

Gerard Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Can you guys share with us, in the past, David, you talked about the IPO market and the sponsors maybe not getting the valuations that they would like as being one of the areas that had to loosen up. And it appears like it is. But when you look at this year, and I think Denis, you touched on it in your remarks, that we're still below -- IPO business is still below the long-term averages. Is it market conditions, do you think, will be a greater influence on the IPO market this year? Or is it still the valuation challenge that you've referenced in the past?

David Solomon
Chairman & CEO

I don't think you've got the valuation challenge we've referenced. I think you're going to see a bunch of sponsor stuff unlock and you're going to see more activity from sponsors. I also think one of the dynamics that we have, and it's just the reality of market structure and the way the world has evolved, companies are staying private longer, and we've got a lot of big, big companies in the pipe that I think, just for a variety of reasons, are reaching a moment in time where they're saying, "You know what, it's time to go."

And I think you're also this year going to see a bunch of IPOs this year and next year of very, very large companies, which is something we really haven't seen a lot of. So a combination of sponsor momentum and more of the big companies that have stayed private longer are now turning toward the public markets. And I think the confluence of that is going to be constructive, provided we have the kind of market environment we have now.

Gerard Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And second, and not to really get political in this question, but it seems like the M&A activity, as you guys do so well and as your peers, in 2025, it seems like this administration is more supportive of consolidation than maybe the prior administration. When you talk to executives about transactions, are they more focused on just the economic outlook and the opportunities there? Or does the regulation also factor into their thinking, thinking that the window is open now and you really need to move possibly before the change in administration in 2029?

David Solomon
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Sure, Gerard. I think a way to frame it and you framed it effectively, we had a very, very different environment from a regulatory perspective for M&A for the last 4 years. And that doesn't mean that it's just a blank check, no regulatory oversight of large-scale consolidation. But CEOs definitely believe that the art of the deal and scale consolidation is possible now. And when CEOs see that opportunity, because scale matters so much in business, business is so competitive, CEOs get very front-footed.

And so I think CEOs and boards are looking and saying, okay, we've got a window here of a handful of years where the opportunity to consider big strategic, transformative things is certainly possible. And therefore, you've got a much, much more front foot forward across industry group of CEOs really thinking about, is there something we should do, is there something we should dream about that really advances our competitive position. And that's leading to -- you see that filtering into our backlog, but I think that's leading to a significant upswing in activity. Provided we don't have some sort of an exogenous event that changes the current sentiment that we now have.

We'll take our next question from Chris McGratty with KBW.

Christopher McGratty
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

A lot of discussion on the capital impact from dereg. I think in your earlier remarks, you talked about expenses. I'm wondering if you could quantify that potential pool of money that could be freed up and redeployed. I guess how much of a drag has it been?

Denis Coleman
Chief Financial Officer

I appreciate the question. I'll follow on David's comments. I mean, I don't think we're going to give you an exact number, but you can imagine that there are a variety of, call it, different human capital, consulting, professional fee-type surge experiences that have been observable across the industry over the last couple of years. And while there will always be work to be done and each and every institution has a responsibility to still govern and run itself in line with regulatory expectations, the current levels of engagement and focus are on the safety and soundness of the banking system.

And there's just a different formulation and mix of expenses required to ensure that most important goal of safety and soundness. And it, therefore, frees up capacity from some of the secondary or tertiary activities, which can then be redeployed to driving growth across the franchise and, actually, frankly, strengthening the safety of the soundness of the firm in another respect. So I think I wouldn't look at it as much of a bottom line unlock as much as an opportunity to redeploy towards helping to grow the firm and actually improve its resiliency.

David Solomon
Chairman & CEO

Yes. The only thing I'd add, Chris, to what Denis said, just to get a little bit more -- we're not going to be able to quantify for you. But the things that you should look at, obviously, if you go back over the last 10 years, capital in the large banks has grown meaningfully over the last 10 years. And now it's actually -- the growth has certainly stopped. And because one of the big things that drove the capital growth was the stress capital buffers for all the firm and the CCAR process, which is very, very opaque, and there's now going to be more transparency around the models of the CCAR process, I think you're getting a different result there.

So one piece of the quantification comes from doing the analysis to look at how SCBs change from kind of 20 -- the late part of the last decade up to 2025 and where they are now and how they've evolved. That's a quantification. The second one was there was an expectation that Basel III was going to put more capital on top of the stack. That's another way that people thought capital is growing. Now the perception is that Basel III is going to be more of a neutral event when it's ultimately closed out.

And then the third thing is G-SIB was supposed to be calibrated to growth in the world and market cap growth that was put in the statute, but it never followed through. So G-SIB, as the world grew, G-SIB wasn't supposed to grow as fast as it was growing, but it grew faster. That's now going to be recalibrated. That's another one. So if you want to kind of calculate those differences, those are 3 important things I would point you to where you can look at the different banks and calculate that impact.

Christopher McGratty
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

That's very helpful. Second question would be more of a business mix desire, right? If you look at the fourth quarter revenue mix, trading 50%, IB 20%, AWM 25%, dominant share, great growth. If you were to fast forward over the next few years, like what do you think this mix looks like? Maybe how do you want to be viewed by the market? Because there are I think implications for the multiple that we'll want to put on your stock.

David Solomon
Chairman & CEO

Yes. We are going to continue to invest in the growth of Asset & Wealth Management and we would like the mix to continue to evolve. I think it can evolve very slowly with the organic growth differential because, this is not unfortunately, but it's a reality, we've been able to grow Global Banking & Markets faster than we might have expected. And even though we've grown asset wealth management very nicely, just given the scale of Global Banking & Markets, that's made the shift in mix slower than we might have all imagined if we go back 5, 6 years and kind of think about the trajectory that we're on.

We will try to find things that accelerate that, in addition to the organic -- inorganically, again, with a real discipline around that, as I've stated over and over again. But I do think if you look forward, the mix of the firm will continue, because the growth in Asset & Wealth Management is faster, it will continue to shift. And we're focused on that.

We'll take our next question from Saul Martinez with HSBC.

Saul Martinez
HSBC Global Investment Research

I just have one question, and it's a clarification more than anything to Erika's question about where we are in the investment banking cycle. And I think, David, in your response, you said that your people are suggesting that in a base case view, 2026 investment banking fees could be close or approach where they were in 2021, which was over $14 billion, and we're running, I think '25 was a bit over $9 billion. The delta really is ECM, obviously, and advisory and DCM are kind of tracking to '21 levels already. But I just wanted to clarify that -- were you talking about IB fees as a whole or were you talking about the individual segments, advisory, DCM?

I apologize if it was clear to everybody else but me. But obviously, an environment where you do $14 billion of investment banking fees, it would seem like an environment where your ROEs for GBM and the firm as a whole would be materially above the mid-teen level. But just if you can just clarify that, that would be helpful.

David Solomon
Chairman & CEO

Sure. I'm sorry, Saul, if I confused you. What I was referring to was advisory fees only. I was -- I'm sorry.

Saul Martinez
HSBC Global Investment Research

Okay. Got that.

David Solomon
Chairman & CEO

What I was referring to was advisory volumes -- excuse me, advisory volumes. Now advisory volumes are very correlated to fees, okay? But the chart that I was referring to was one that looked at 3 different cases for advisory volumes, okay? So it wasn't equity capital markets, et cetera. I will tell you that what went on in 2021 with equity capital raising, particularly around the SPAC phenomenon, that's not going to occur in 2026. So my guess would be that equity capital markets levels will still be meaningfully below the 2021 peak in 2026, but they will be higher than they were this year. That would be my estimate based on what we see today.

But I was talking specifically about advisory volumes when I made that quote. And look, the advisory, as we've said over and over again, when advisory activity grows, the flywheel creates lots of activity. And we were talking industry-wide, not just GS, looking at just industry-wide volume.

Saul Martinez
HSBC Global Investment Research

Yes. Okay. Got it. No, that's helpful. Thank you for clarifying that.

David Solomon
