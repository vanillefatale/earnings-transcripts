[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Irene Nattel with RBC Capital Markets.

Irene Nattel
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

And congratulations on another exceptional quarter. As you noted in your commentary, boutique openings continue to be the most visible driver of growth. And you mentioned a few times the long-term sustainable runway. And I'm wondering whether we should be thinking that at this point, maybe you might be accelerating the number of new store openings as we look ahead.

Jennifer Wong
CEO & Non-Independent Director

Irene, thank you for your question. We certainly did have a tremendous quarter, and we have talked about the market potential in the past, particularly in the United States, where we have just 72 boutiques right now, I have mentioned that we see a long-term opportunity of anywhere from 180 to 200, possibly north of 200 boutiques in the U.S.

And our focus continues to attract to be on attracting new clients and engaging our existing clients. And so right now, we're talking about opening a minimum of 12 to 14 boutiques in this year and in the next year. And as we look forward, we think that this cadence probably makes sense for us. That also includes a number of repositions, 4 to 5 repositions. And at this time, this is the cadence of store openings and repositions that we're looking at.

The next question comes from Luke Hannan with Canaccord Genuity.

Luke Hannan
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

I wanted to ask about the app. More specifically, how successful was the launch of the app and the promotion for the 20% off on the initial order? How successful was this in driving new clientele, both online and in-store.

Jennifer Wong
CEO & Non-Independent Director

Thanks for your question. The app launch was phenomenal. In 2 words, I'd say it was wildly successful. In my prepared remarks, I talked about downloads of over $1 million to date is at 1.4 million downloads. In the first day that we launched, we were the #1 app in the entire app store in both countries. I think we were the #1 shopping app in Canada for 18 days. we were beating out ChatGPT there for a number of days, particularly in Canada. So I mean, the app launch was beyond our wildest expectations. And we couldn't be more pleased at the results, I'm so proud of the team.

The next question comes from Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies.

Corey Tarlowe
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I just had a couple of questions. One, on the complexion of the comp, could you just talk a little bit about the traffic versus ticket and maybe how that's trended so far throughout the year? And any color on what that's looked like quarter-to-date? And then the second one is just a follow-up for Todd. On the second DC that you're opening, are there any considerations about what that cost might look like from a margin perspective or the fact that you're comping so strongly? does it just basically get netted out? I'm curious if you could provide any color there.

Jennifer Wong
CEO & Non-Independent Director

So on traffic -- Corey, on traffic, we said in our prepared remarks that our business, our top line and our comps, in particular, are primarily driven by traffic. We are seeing a huge change in terms of any other indicators like ticket price or basket size. I would say our business is primarily driven by traffic.

Todd Ingledew
Chief Financial Officer

Great. And on the new distribution center in Vancouver, which I assume is the one you're referring to, not the potential second DC in the United States. For next year, obviously, we will have incremental rent. As that DC ramps, we do expect to have savings from it, but not at the beginning. And we are still planning for increased margin or margin expansion next year, and we look forward to providing guidance in May as it relates to the distribution center and the rest of our line items. But we do anticipate margin expansion next year despite the DC starting up.

Corey Tarlowe
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. And is there any color on maybe any category specifically or anything you can provide there? That resonated really well in the quarter and then maybe quarter-to-date as well where you've seen some nice traction.

Jennifer Wong
CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes. There's nothing really that we can speak of in terms of category. The demand for product was broad-based across all of our assortment. And everything -- when our business is -- we've said this before, when our business is good, and we're delivering 43% top line increase, I mean there's a lot of things working really well. And certainly, our product assortment is just fantastic. I love what I see when I walk into the stores and when I'm scrolling online. I think our product looks absolutely fantastic. And what's even more is that we are in and have been in an excellent inventory position to meet the demand. So everything is working.

Next question comes from Brian Morrison with TD Cowen.

Brian Morrison
TD Cowen, Research Division

I want to go back to the mobile app. Can you just talk about perhaps what the penetration rate as a percentage of e-commerce was, maybe elaborate, Jen, on you talked about additional initiatives or new features that are forthcoming. And does the initial reception make you feel in time it could represent 40% of e-commerce sales? Is that realistic? And then just as a follow-up, your international website, can you just comment on where you're seeing the greatest traction with respect to regions?

Jennifer Wong
CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes, all really good questions. Thanks, Brian. It's still very, very early days for us with the app. We just launched it. It's really only been up and running for a couple of months now. And I have also said that it's going to take us a few quarters to really see where the app nets out.

What we're seeing with our best-in-class peer set is that the app makes up anywhere from 20% to 40% of their overall e-commerce business. I would say we are on track to be in that best-in-class category for sure. And so I'm very encouraged to see these early results. But as I said, it's probably too early to tell. I do anticipate that a portion of that will be incremental lift to our e-commerce business. And so only time will tell.

And certainly, as it relates to the new features that you're asking about? I suppose a byproduct of our success is that everyone is watching us. So keeping in mind the competitive factors, I can share probably in very broad strokes what we we're leaning into. Certainly, the digital styling is something that keeps our customer returning to the app will produce more content, more interesting content, unique content and storytelling for the app.

Of course, there will always be smaller optimizations to reduce the friction in the shopping journey, looking to integrate the app with the boutique experiences in store for a truly omni experience. So things of this nature. We've got a really robust road map that the team has put together. And again, super excited for future releases of the app and upgrades. And so just, again, couldn't be more thrilled with the performance of the app so far. As it relates to international, continue -- it's almost -- I mean that was a big piece of news, too, and Todd and I were actually kind of joking that after the app news, it's almost like a secondary thought, but still a really important aspect of our overall digital business. We're already seeing higher revenue growth driven by increased conversion on the international e-com site.

I realize that it's only just over 1% of our current e-commerce business, but we've stated that we see that tripling in 2 years, and we are, again, well on track to see that. And so right now, I don't know if we're sharing what the top 5 areas of the world are, but certainly, I guess I'll say in no particular order, English-speaking countries like the U.K. and Australia, which isn't a surprise. Certainly, we have interest in Central Europe, like Switzerland and Germany. And certainly, Asia, like China is a very big market for many people. And so you would expect that to be a good response there, too.

What I'd say the good news is that we're getting lots of good information for future expansion of the Aritzia brand.

The next question comes from Jon Keypour with Goldman Sachs.

Jonathan Keypour
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

So I was wondering, given the momentum you guys are seeing and the seeming synergies in the word of mouth and the awareness around the brand. Are you finding any flexibility in the previously stated target of low single-digit marketing as a percent of sales?

Jennifer Wong
CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes. Marketing has certainly amplified our brand and created a building greater affinity for our brand. I think it's been a huge add in the last year, 1.5 years to our overall playbook. And what we see with marketing is increasing the marketing spend in line with sales. So it will grow commensurate with our overall top line sales and remain a low single-digit percentage of sales.

Jonathan Keypour
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Great. If I could get a follow-up. Just curious about the progression of the sales momentum from the pre-Black Friday period to the off-sale period between Cyber Monday and Boxing Week, so like the 2 periods of nondiscounting. Just what the momentum between those 2 periods look like?

Jennifer Wong
CEO & Non-Independent Director

I mean as both Todd and I say, we're absolutely thrilled with the momentum going from Q3 into Q4, effectively, we -- the momentum has been tremendous. We have -- it's -- and what do I say, we've had a phenomenal season. We've had a phenomenal last quarter, couldn't be more thrilled with what's happening going into Q4. We remind you we're lapping extremely robust growth last year in Q4, and we just really see our business firing on all cylinders.

The next question comes from Mark Petrie with CIBC.

Mark Petrie
CIBC Capital Markets, Research Division

And I'll echo my congratulations on the stellar results. Two areas of follow-up, I guess. first, just on the app integration or introduction, where would you say that put you in terms of e-commerce 2.0? Like how far are you in terms of, I guess, execution? And then how far along do you think you are in terms of seeing the payoff from that with consumers?

Jennifer Wong
CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes. We -- about 2 years ago, we embarked on e-commerce 2.0, and we had a real concerted effort and intention to accelerate our digital and omni business, with the build-out of the team and leadership there. I think we're probably 1/3 to approaching halfway through. I think we've built a lot of good fundamentals, a lot of good base infrastructure. We re-platformed our technology stack. We've restructured the team and our ways of working a little bit. We've now hit a couple of milestones with the international e-commerce side with the app. There's still a lot of runway to go and still a lot of really exciting things for us to do.

And I think with it continuing to be about 1/3 of our business, while our retail business is absolutely taken off as well. I think back when we were talking about e-commerce 2.0, the retail -- we had been projecting the retail business at a certain clip. And the retail business has actually outperformed what we originally thought then, too. So considering that our penetration has stayed the same and continues to keep up with the retail base continuing to grow at the clip that it's growing. I think overall, our business in both channels is doing phenomenal. And certainly accelerating digital and the omni-experience is a big part of that.

The next question comes from Joe Civello with Truist.

Joseph Civello
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

I just wanted to ask, were there any transitory costs associated with kind of logistical process shifts due to de minimis exemption change. And then secondly, as we build through next year, can we just talk more about some of your IMU initiatives and what inning you're in there, especially as scale continues to grow so rapidly?

Todd Ingledew
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks. 100%, there were costs in Q3 embedded related to the de minimis removal and the shift of all of our fulfillment in the United States. That makes up a portion of the 410 basis points of pressure that we experienced from the tariff and the removal of the de minimis with about 2/3 of the pressure coming from the tariffs and 1/3 coming from the removal of the de minimis. Of note, obviously, we are extremely pleased that we still leveraged 30 basis points for really a total increase of 440 basis points ex the tariff and de minimis in the quarter. So pleased with that. And there was some benefit from IMU improvement in Q3. But as we look forward, we are continuing that multiyear IMU improvement and do anticipate that it will be part of the driver of what helps us improve our margins again next year.

The next question comes from Mauricio Serna with UBS.

Mauricio Serna Vega
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

First, maybe could you talk a little bit more about the brand awareness component. You mentioned that as one of your levers. How has that progressed in the U.S.? How does that look relative to Canada? And then quick follow-up on the Q4 guidance. Is it fair to assume on sales that, that implies around like a mid-teens comp for the quarter? And what is that -- like what is the comp looking quarter-to-date?

Jennifer Wong
CEO & Non-Independent Director

Thanks, Mauricio. I'll take the first part of the question on our brand momentum. I mean experiencing amazing brand momentum, particularly in the last 1.5 years when we increased our marketing efforts and our strategic investments in marketing and that, coupled with the boutique openings themselves and the flagships are opening.

So I think it's not any one thing. It's many things all coming together and certainly the marketing is amplifying all of the amazing things that we're doing in the business to elevate our brand and to really ensure that everyday luxury comes to life in everything that we do in every touch point with the client. And certainly, I think our business itself is showing the results of the increased brand awareness in the U.S. and not just awareness but actual affinity for the brand and love for the brand. In Canada, we're very well known and loved and that our goal was to achieve that same level in the U.S. And I think we are well on our way. And certainly, our results with the 43% top line increase, a $1 billion quarter shows that.

Todd Ingledew
Chief Financial Officer

Great. And I'll take the comp portion of the question. In the fourth quarter, our guidance assumes comp in the high teens, which delivers the 23% to 26% revenue growth. And we are trending slightly ahead of that today.

Mauricio Serna Vega
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Got it. Just a very quick follow-up on that. So I guess like if I think about your commentary that you said 2-year stacks accelerated throughout Q3. That means like that acceleration has continued into December and quarter-to-date just based on this guidance and what you -- yes, what you're expecting in the comp?

Todd Ingledew
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Yes, 100%. It's accelerated slightly. Obviously, we're lapping 26% comp in Q4 last year. So we've got 43% to 46% approximately from a comp -- a 2-year stacked comp that we have embedded in our guidance. And we're extremely pleased with what we're seeing in the fourth quarter. And we were obviously a number of months ago, seeing great momentum in our business and knowing that we had November and the acceleration that we saw in November coming up. And obviously, we've just moved right through that and continue to see the extremely strong momentum in the business.

The next question comes from Chris Li with Desjardins.

Christopher Li
Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the strong results. My first question is, I know that over the last couple of years, you have done a lot of work to make the inventory more productive and efficient. Are you pretty much where you need to be now? Or is there room for further optimization that will allow you to really capitalize on the strong product demand and drive further margin improvement?

Jennifer Wong
CEO & Non-Independent Director

Thanks for your question, Chris. We have done a lot of work in terms of how we approach our inventory. And I would say the team has done tremendous work and has taken things to the next level in terms of how they're looking at our inventory and the level of sophistication with our inventory management is just phenomenal. So I would say nothing is ever perfect around here. I mean I think that's one of the things that drives us is we're striving for perfection and we're -- we have this culture of continuous improvement and always refining right down to the last minute and finding detail of what we can be better. So we're always going to be honing our craft here and always getting better, and we always do get better.

But certainly, as it relates to inventory, I would say that is a huge driver, one of the many things that we're doing very well, but it's a huge driver to these fantastic results. Certainly, we have had the inventory to meet the demand and the increase in demand that we've experienced, particularly in the last year. And again, I couldn't be more pleased with what the team has done in order to make sure that we are in that position and continue to be in that position.

Christopher Li
Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division

That's very helpful. And if I may squeeze in just a follow-up. Just in terms of the comps guidance for Q4, the high teens would imply north of 45% 2-year stack. I know you guys haven't given guidance for next year. But as you start really lapping really strong comps, it's sort of that 2-year stack reasonable to expect for next year, given really the strong momentum that you guys are continuing to see?

Jennifer Wong
CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes. I like your enthusiasm for what's going on here for us. I mean we're just as enthusiastic about 2027 as well, although we're not providing any guidance on this call today for 2027. What I will say is we are thrilled with the momentum. We do have to keep in mind the 2-year stack. That said, we are super well set up to succeed and have a strong year with all the elements in place to deliver in 2027 like we have in so far in 2026. And we're going to stick to our strategy and stick to our playbook and because that's proven that that's delivered, whether it be having the right product in the right place at the right time, increasing our square footage growth with the 12 to 14 boutique openings and additional repositions.

We got those digital initiatives on the go. and certainly, the strategic investments in marketing that help create more demand and drive even more traffic. So all of those things remain in place, and it gives me tremendous confidence for what we have ahead. I've been with the company now for a very long time. I'm coming up on 39 years, and I've never been more excited about the business as I am right now.

The next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.

Irwin Boruchow
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Let me add my congrats. I guess 2 questions from me, maybe for Todd.

I guess, I know you're not going to comment specifically on guidance for next year, but last quarter, you kind of took the 19% off the table and just went a little bit lower to high teens given the tariffs that you've meaningfully outperformed in Q3 and your implied 4Q just went up by a lot. So I mean, are you comfortable putting the 19% back on the table just because of the upside you've kind of generated this quarter and what's coming up in the fourth quarter? And then a quick follow-up to that is it's a product of your own success. You guys are going to be lapping something like 25% plus comps annually next year.

You go back a couple of years ago, you guys also had a phenomenal year, and you had a little bit of trouble lapping those tough compares. It doesn't seem like that's happening at all here. But are there learnings from fiscal '24 that you kind of apply to kind of make sure that doesn't happen again? I'm just kind of curious how you can compare and contrast what's coming up in '27 versus kind of what happened back in '24?

Todd Ingledew
Chief Financial Officer

I'll take the first question. So first off, no, we would not put the 19% back on the table at this point. And I think we're most comfortable with that high teens. We do plan to have further margin expansion next year. But I think we're more comfortable with the high teens than leaving the 19% or putting the 19% back on the table. But we look forward to providing guidance again in May.

Jennifer Wong
CEO & Non-Independent Director

And the second part of your question, which is kind of a broad question. My response to that is it comes down to execution. And what we're experiencing right now is an example of as close to impeccable execution as you can get. And I think we've always prided ourselves on executing in the business. And when we're executing in all areas of the business is when we see these exceptional results. So what I would say to your question is, right now, I find it immensely gratifying to see how our strategy, which has not changed and the focus of the last 3 years is coming to fruition and delivering on these results. And I think if we stick to that and continue to do what we're doing, we will see consistency in our growth and in delivering results.

The next question comes from Navin Nuchem with BMO Capital Markets.

Unknown Analyst

Nevin on for Steve today. I'm hoping you can provide an update on your sourcing exposure by company -- or sorry, country rather and just confirm whether you're on track for the mid-single-digit percentage or less from China by spring '26.

Todd Ingledew
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, we're on track. That's one of the things that we're extremely pleased with what we've accomplished over the last 12 months. The team has done a remarkable job. Sitting here this time last year, we were receiving our spring inventory and approximately 30% to 35% of that was being sourced from China. And today, we are in the mid-single-digit country of origin from China. And so it's actually remarkable what the teams have done over that 12-month period. We are more weighted now to Vietnam and Cambodia as well as a number of other countries. But I think over time, the next phase of our sourcing initiative is to balance more evenly and try to get to a position where maybe we have no more than 20% to 25% sourced from any given country.

The next question comes from Michael Glen with Raymond James.

Michael Glen
Raymond James Ltd., Research Division

Just 1 question for me. The 1.4 million downloads that you spoke about, Jennifer. How do we think about that in terms of a penetration rate across your overall customer base? And how does that penetration rate compare against what you see with peers. Thank you.

Jennifer Wong
CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes. Great question. Obviously, the response to our app has been tremendous. And I think our clients have been very quick to recognize the value that the app offers and hence, the number of downloads. And so the majority of the customers downloading the app are our existing customers. They are a highly engaged customer. The great news is that there is a good portion of those downloads that are new customers. And what I find particularly encouraging is that we even have a few reactivated customers, customers who haven't shopped with us in quite some time. And because of the app that they renewed their relationship with us. So I think on all different points, the app is providing us tremendous benefit and certainly is allowing us to engage with a customer even more deeply.

Michael Glen
Raymond James Ltd., Research Division

And I know you're unlikely to give me a number, but is 1.4 million, how do we think about where that number could eventually get to over time?

Jennifer Wong
CEO & Non-Independent Director

As I said earlier in this call, it's too early to tell and you're absolutely correct, I am unlikely to tell you that number. But really, it's very early to tell. And certainly, there was a lot of marketing support around the launch of the app. So we came out with fantastic success. And we'll share more as we know more as the quarters progress.

The last question comes from Martin Landry with Stifel.

Martin Landry
Stifel Nicolaus Canada Inc., Research Division

Congrats on your results. Maybe just a quick one for me on fiscal '27. You've talked about 4 -- 12 to 14 boutiques opening and 4 to 5 relocations. What does that mean in terms of square footage growth?

Todd Ingledew
Chief Financial Officer

Overall total square footage growth, it would be in the low teens.

Martin Landry
Stifel Nicolaus Canada Inc., Research Division

low teens. Perfect. Okay. Thank you so much, and congrats again.
