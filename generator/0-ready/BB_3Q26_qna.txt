Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And the first question today will come from Kingsley Crane with Canaccord Genuity.

William Kingsley Crane
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

Congrats on a really nice quarter. So we've talked about the GEM opportunity naturally requiring more investment in the near term as you work towards gaining critical mass in key end markets. And again, really nice wins in the quarter on that segment. But as you think about fiscal '27, where do you think you need to invest more within that space? Like what's working, what needs more help?

John Giamatteo
CEO & Director

Yes, Kingsley, I think on that one, I think from a product perspective, we're in really good shape. I think the GEDP platform that we talked about is a really good leverage point for us to bring value to our customers. So I think you'll probably see us continue to invest in go-to-market activities. More feet on the street. It's a broader market. Partnerships with distributors and other technology providers that maybe can help bring us to market a little bit faster. So these are probably the areas that we'll continue to invest in as we go into the next fiscal year.

William Kingsley Crane
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

Okay. Great. And then the follow-up would be on this luxury China EV win. We're really encouraged by that. What ultimately allowed you to win that deal? Do you think it was cost savings, weight savings, superior software functionality and then -- to what extent could this be a blueprint for more success in China?

John Giamatteo
CEO & Director

I think it's -- honestly, I think it's all of the above. I think it's cost savings, it's weight savings. It's the performance of the product itself. I would say the Chinese market tends to be very price sensitive. So I think the amount of money that they can save leveraging our technology and what that does to their overall BOM is a compelling value proposition. So that probably swayed a little bit more. But the broader value proposition is very, very sound, pardon the pun. But it's -- I think the actual cost savings is probably the lead one on that.

And the next question will come from Luke Junk with Baird.

Luke Junk
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

John, maybe if we could start just in terms of getting to a vehicle platform award, just if you could talk about some of the gates you're advancing through right now to get you closer to that outcome. And then as we look forward to a couple of weeks to CES, should we expect to hear more about this at CES as well?

John Giamatteo
CEO & Director

Yes. Luke, great question. I'll tell you, it's an area that has got a lot of focus right now inside the company. And from a technology perspective, bringing QNX SDP 8 and the middleware together and the integration, the connective tissue, making that a seamless kind of product that we could bring to our customers. It's a lot of collaboration with our partner, Vector to really bring that. So I think the product itself is really sound. It's just a matter of the integration with our partner and then bringing that to the marketplace. So a lot of good progress that's moving in this regard, but we're pleased with the progress, and you'll hear more about it.

Luke Junk
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And then I wanted to follow up to your answer about luxury China EV win. In terms of the cost sensitivity, I mean, certainly, that's a well-known factor in the China market. And I'm just wondering, in terms of system design or things that are sort of you can bring to the table from a QNX standpoint to put BOM into a more compelling position? Like just what are some of the key areas that you can enable for a Chinese OEM in that respect, John?

John Giamatteo
CEO & Director

Yes. I think certainly, the cost savings and the time-to-market capabilities are something that's compelling. But one thing we do think is going to start getting more traction in the Chinese market is safety solutions. I think in the past, they've kind of used some basic technologies. And because they've had some high-profile safety issues, we're excited about the opportunities that could be there for us for SDP 8 and bringing kind of the core RTOS to the -- so it's great. Sometimes you get in with maybe Sound or Cabin or different things like that and maybe drag along kind of the core product in some ways. But it's -- I think it's a testament to the broad portfolio of the platform. You might lead with Sound and get your foot in the door and then bring the RTOS along.

More times than not, it's the other way around. It's -- because that's the meat and potatoes from the operating system level. So we're working every single angle in the Chinese market. But I think they are a little more acutely aware and concerned with the need for having an SDV platform that has safety certifications, probably more so than they have been in the past.

The next question will come from Todd Coupland with CIBC.

Thomas Ingham
CIBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Great. Thanks, good evening, everyone. I wanted to start with QNX, 15% growth last quarter, 10% this quarter, guide implies 15% growth. How should we think about the trend in this business given that fluctuating growth rate as we're thinking about fiscal 2027?

Tim Foote
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Great question, Todd. So ultimately, we'll give the guide for fiscal '27 at the end of Q4, so in 90 days' time. Look, double-digit growth has been very solid. And Ultimately, we're going to be giving the backlog number as well in Q4, which will be a good lead indicator of where we're moving. On the backlog, we're actually feeling pretty good, as John mentioned in his prepared remarks that after a difficult start, we've actually accelerated pretty well, and we've got some really good momentum now as we head into Q4 and conversion of that backlog into revenue, which will start in FY '27 is going to really drive that business forward.

And what we saw in Q3 was strong royalties and royalties driven by some of these new programs that we've been winning over the last couple of years now starting to come online. So yes, it's an exciting time and some of the growth accelerators such as going up the stack, things like Sound and Cabin that we've mentioned, we're starting to see traction from those 2. So I'm going to put a pin in it and say, come back in 90 days, and we'll give you more information on next year, but we feel very positive about the momentum that we've got in this business.

Thomas Ingham
CIBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Great. Tim, and then just on secure comm, the business is trending probably about half of the decline rates you've been projecting the last couple of quarters. Is this the new normal? And again, similar type of mindset as we think about fiscal '27? Could this business actually turn into a growth segment with defense spending trending positive and other segments doing better. So just talk about how we should think about that.

John Giamatteo
CEO & Director

Great question, Todd. That's a really good question. We're actually -- right now, as you would imagine, just modeling out next year, taking a look at the pipeline and things do tend to be a little lumpy sometimes in this space. So I don't think 1 quarter necessarily translates into. But I will say we have a really strong pipeline within secure comms, one of the stronger pipelines that we've had in a long time.

So that bodes well for us. It's probably, like Tim said before, it's next quarter, we'll give guidance for the next fiscal year, but it was a solid quarter. To be honest with you, we are happy we navigated the U.S. government shutdown the way that we did. We were a little spooked by that as the quarter was going on, but I think that turned out to be a pretty good result for us in the end. And now it's just a matter of converting the pipeline that we've got in front of us to tee up a really solid fiscal year '27. So we'll come back to you with more insights into that, but certainly pleased with the way that business is performing.

The next question will come from Trip Chowdhry with Global Equities Research.

Trip Chowdhry
Global Equities Research, LLC

Thank you. Congratulations on a very solid execution. I have 2 quick questions. The first regarding the government shutdown. Do you think now everything is normal? Or you think like almost more than half of the quarter was in shut down, do you think the remaining half made up of the first half? That's first question.

Second question, very refreshing to hear your wins in the robotic space. I was wondering if you can put some more color about what kind of robots may be using your technology? And any color on the demand side also? That's all for me.

John Giamatteo
CEO & Director

Thanks, Trip. I'll cover a little bit on government, and we'll cover a little bit on robotics, Trip, just to give you some color on it. But as far as government is concerned, it's been a really interesting year. We started the year with Liberation Day and the uncertainty that, that brought. That in some ways, created some opportunities and also created some headwinds.

We also had in the government space, the continuing resolutions at one point, then a full-on shutdown at one point. But I think the good thing -- I think what we learned from this experience, remember, DOGE was another one. How much -- how was that going to impact our business. But one of the learnings that I think we took away from the last 6 or 9 months on the secure comp side is what we do in terms of mission critical events management, mission-critical SecuSUITE encrypted voice, data and video. Mission-critical UEM and the security that, that provides.

These mission-critical -- when it comes time to take a look at what they're going to cut, what we found they're a little bit hesitant to really take a hatchet to mission-critical types of software solutions. So we were a little concerned about the timing with the -- in Q3 with the U.S. federal government, in particular, because everything is shut down, their procurement then had a backlog of contracts that they had to process, but I think we were fortunate enough to kind of work through that where it really didn't impact the quarter as much as we initially thought it was going to be.

So there's a lot of different dynamics with the governments, but I have to say, I think, we've been successfully navigating a lot of the waves there in some of the changes that's gone on. We'll come back to you, Trip, with more details on robotics and medical instrumentation and industrial automation and give you more colors on the wins.

Sometimes, we're a little bit -- some of our customers are a little hesitant to share too much information about the use case and the design win. There's -- for confidentiality and different reasons. But in the robotics space, when we think of humanoid robotics, we think of the more technology that's going into this vertical. There's more compute power. There's more performance that's required and that's a sweet spot for QNX.

So regardless of the type of robotics, if you need high compute and you need high performance, SDP 8 is the solution for them to look at. So we'll bring that a little bit more to life, I think, in the future. Actually, we'll have some demos at the booth where we -- at CES this year to show it a little bit more. But hopefully, that gives you a little bit color on robotics and we'll be sure to share some more in the future.

Yes. That's perfect. Thank you so much, and happy holidays.

The next question will come from Paul Treiber with RBC Capital Markets.

Paul Treiber
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

You made an interesting comment on the pricing opportunity for the vehicle software platform. Can you just speak to what you see as a potential ROI or the cost savings that the automakers would benefit from that? And then also, could you speak to the economics, the split between QNX and Vector or maybe your ability to capture a disproportionate share of the pricing there?

Tim Foote
Chief Financial Officer

Paul. So ultimately, what we're providing here -- and remember, this has been a pull from the OEMs have come to us and asked if we can help in this area. Because I think if we look back over the last couple of years, the OEMs have been very ambitious in terms of trying to write all the code from the OS up to the application layer and really found that to be quite a challenge.

So in terms of cost savings, having us do it much more efficiently and actually being able to produce a product that they can get into market is a big advantage for them. We're taking off their hands off their plate, a load of software integration. But currently, they have a heck of a lot of internal resource working on. So they can divert that resource to the application layer, which is where they're really going to differentiate their brand from other players.

So yes, we're doing a lot of heavy lifting for them. And like I say, this is a pull. They've come to us and say, "Can you do this for us?" In terms of the economics, we're not going to give like the absolute details here, but clearly, a portion of the pie is coming from Vector. A significant portion, I should add, is coming from us, and there will be a split. Now we are going to be the billing entities, so we will take the revenue and the vector portion would obviously be passed on through cost of sales.

And the second question is just on the Canadian federal government. The budget was out in November, and there's a number of new investment initiatives. Can you just remind us again of the size of your secure comms business for the Canadian government? And then what do you see as the opportunity and what's the strategy to try to expand further with the Canadian government?

John Giamatteo
CEO & Director

Yes. Yes. Great question, Paul. It's a lot of -- actually great momentum that we have right now with the Canadian government, especially their by Canada kind of solution, looking to do more with Canadian providers. We do have a comprehensive relationship with them today around UEM. They use that widely throughout the organization. And we're having really good productive discussions with them about Secusmart and AtHoc and other parts of the portfolio as well. So stay tuned. We've got a lot of activity going on. We've got a multiyear agreement with them today that's very UEM-centric and as we look to try to expand into Secusmart, SecuSUITE product and the AtHoc portfolio, we're finding some really good discussions with them right now, particularly as they ramp up their spending on defense.

So critical events management is something that is widely deployed in the entire U.S. government. We're hoping we could bring that same value proposition to the Canadian government as they ramp up their defense spending over the next few years. So we'll keep you posted on it. But be rest assured, there's a lot of activity going on right now with the Canadian government.
