[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.

Sanjay Sakhrani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Good job on 2025. I know you guys had a lot to deal with. Maybe just starting on the mid-single-digit growth guide for receivables growth. I think that's quite encouraging. Brian, can you just talk about sort of the building blocks for that? I saw the co-brand volume growth accelerated. Is that partly due to Walmart? Or how are the early views of Walmart looking?

And then, Brian Wenzel, you talked a little bit about not necessarily assuming any changes to sort of the underwriting stance for the year, but is that something you're considering inside the guide?

Brian Doubles
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Sanjay, why don't I start on that? So look, I think overall, we're pretty encouraged by what we're seeing in terms of the consumer. I think the consumer has been resilient all year, I think better than we expected. We're not really seeing any signs of weakness. We're actually seeing strength as we look at the spending patterns. I think credit continues to outperform our expectations, as you mentioned. So I think the macro environment is still pretty constructive. Bigger tax refunds could potentially help us a little bit here in the short term as well. But if you look at our business more specifically, I think purchase volume turned the corner, nice trajectory, up 3% versus last year. We've got 4 out of 5 platforms improving sequentially. We're seeing really nice growth in co-brand purchase volume, up 16% versus prior year, as you mentioned. So we're kind of firing on all cylinders, and we feel pretty good about that mid-single-digit loan guide.

If you look at the components, Walmart is obviously a big part of that. We launched in September. It's the fastest-growing program we've ever launched. So we feel great about that. We're making continued investments in Health & Wellness, that's a platform that continues to outperform, and we expect it to continue to outperform next year. So Lowe's commercial program, there's just a lot of things as you tick down the list that we're really optimistic about, as we look forward to '26.

And I don't know, Brian, if you want to add to that?

Brian Wenzel
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Sanjay, so a couple of things I'd just add on to what Brian said. I mean, first, look at the trajectory as you step through 2025, we're at minus 4, minus 2. And you get through the end part of 2025, you were plus 3 on purchase volume. If you take that and extrapolate that into the first several weeks of 2026, we have accelerated the purchase line beyond that rate. Now again, we'll see what happens this weekend after the snowstorm and ice storm came through, but we were encouraged by that increased spending.

Even when you look at the holiday inside of the fourth quarter, our holiday partners, which make up about 2/3 of our portfolio, grew above a 4% rate. It's really the non-holiday partners, which again was about 1/3, was growing significantly less than that, which how you got to the 3. And even you see green shoots in the portfolio, one of the biggest things that you think about that guide, Sanjay, is where is consumer confidence. You saw a tick-up. Most certainly, that trails a lot of times what we're starting to see in our portfolio. And if you look at like Home Specialty, here's something that was comping down every quarter was kind of flattish in the fourth. So if you can get that bigger ticket to turn and consumer confidence to turn, I think that gives you momentum.

I think if you pull up for a second, the growth rate, as you think about it for -- moving forward, we were just slightly down 1 to mid-single digits is really put in 3 buckets, right? Number one, the core book, which we just talked about, some of the momentum, you highlighted co-brand. The other things we're seeing is some of the green shoots and the consumer confidence. Two goes into the credit aperture changes we made in 2025 that will contribute into the portfolio. We don't have incremental credit aperture changes in the guide here. That's something obviously at our discretion depending on how credit performs.

And then third, it's really Walmart and Lowe's, as they kind of come into the portfolio. And again, the opportunity with Walmart is obviously significant given their customer path. So I think there's many different levers. And even when you look at the consumer behavior, both on a frequency and average transaction value basis, we're showing improvement in both of those as we exit out of 2025. So really, I think, strong performance by the consumer in an uncertain environment.

Sanjay Sakhrani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Just my follow-up question is on these -- the news on the 10% APR caps. I'm just curious if you got -- obviously, your views on it, but if you guys have any chances to talk to some of your partners about sort of how they're thinking about it because it definitely affects both you and them as well. So just curious to hear your views and your feedback.

Brian Doubles
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Sure, Sanjay. So look, I think the administration is focused on affordability, which we completely agree is important for consumers and the economy. And as you know, like we pride ourselves on offering credit to a very broad cross-section of the U.S. consumer. We approve more customers at that low to mid-income level than many other issuers. And I think that availability of credit is critical to the economy. As you know, this is a highly competitive industry. And credit cards are one of the most competitive spaces in banking. Our products have to be competitively priced. And we also have to offer significant value to the consumer.

So any price controls, like an APR cap, would not make credit more affordable. It would eliminate credit for those that need it. A cap would require issuers to significantly reduce the amount of credit they're able to provide. And again, that disproportionately impacts the consumers at the lower income levels. And then, you mentioned our partners, I mean, this is very bad for merchants that depend on those credit programs. We support 400,000 small- to medium-sized businesses who depend on those credit programs. In some cases, we can be over 40% of their sales. So this would be a huge hit for them.

So when you look at what the severe impact on both the consumers and businesses, there's no question this would be very bad for the economy. And we're out there talking to our partners every day, the big partners, small to medium-sized businesses, and they're very concerned when they think about what this would do to their businesses.

Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.

Ryan Nash
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Maybe just start on credit. The guide, I think, would imply losses increasing slightly at the midpoint despite strong delinquency performance. And if I'm doing the math correct, if I use the '17 to '19 seasonality, that would put losses on the low end, although, I guess, losses were rising in '17, so that overstates the seasonality. So maybe can you unpack the credit guide a bit? Did you expect to be at the low end of that or potentially lower? And maybe just talk about any benefit that is baked in from the elevated tax refunds.

Brian Wenzel
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Let me unpack that a little bit, Ryan. Thanks for the question. First, based on the performance, right, and where delinquency is as we enter into 2026, I mean, obviously, when you look at net charge-offs of 5.37% for the fourth quarter and how that kind of steps out and the favorability that you have versus the historical loss rate in '17 and '19 to 12 basis points better, obviously, 30-plus being 13 basis points better than that historical period and a little bit narrower on 90 plus at 2.17%, but 7 basis points better. So the formation as we enter into 2026 is strong, right, number one.

The full year, obviously, for this year was 5.65%. The way to think about it, Ryan, a little bit is you got a strong foundation bringing you into the year, but you're also bringing into a new portfolio. We talked quite a bit about Walmart kind of coming in. You have early losses associated with that. So there's an upward bias, right, relative to the OnePay Walmart program.

You also have a little bit of upward bias, right, relative to, I'd say, the credit aperture changes that we made during the middle part of fourth quarter of this year. They begin to bleed in the back half of the year. So they do factor into losses to some degree as you kind of come through here. So there are some moving pieces here.

We don't really kind of give you a point within the guide. Obviously, the biggest thing is going to be as the macro develop. In our models, and you saw it for reserves, we have unemployment rising a little bit in the back half of the year. From a model standpoint, that obviously produces higher net charge-offs. So to the extent that, that unemployment remains in a check position, I think you're going to have some favorability as it comes to that. So we're going to have to see how it plays out as we step through the year. Again, I think we're really proud of the efficacy of what we've done. It sets us up nicely for the year.

Ryan Nash
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got you. Maybe as my follow-up, Brian, can you maybe just talk about what kind of net interest margin is embedded within the guidance? Should we assume continued improvement given the PPPCs and the benefits from lower rates? Or are there other headwinds that we should be considering?

Brian Wenzel
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Obviously, we refer on the outlook page that you should see NII increase, right? And obviously, there's probably a greater bias for the margin to increase. I think, when you look at the pieces, Ryan, there's probably different gives and takes, right? So number one, when you think about the interest and fee line, clearly, that's going to continue to benefit, albeit at a slower pace as you kind of move through 2026 from the PPPCs, as they continue to build both on the APR piece and then as delinquent pricing piece kind of comes in. So that's actually favorable.

If you kind of think about that line, again, you're going to have part of the interest rate environment kind of coming down, so you're going to have prime rate going down against that as you step through. Depending upon how where you come out on losses, you obviously have a late fee impact that's going to either be neutral, higher or lower depending upon where you set that charge-offs in your model. I think then, when you kind of continue on and think about the different pieces, interest rates obviously will be favorable year-over-year again. That should be offset, I would say, by both prime rate, number one; the investment portfolio yield, number two; and the MDR, number three. So that should probably be a little bit more neutral as you kind of step through it.

So as you kind of look at it, the biggest thing is going to be obviously payment rate, and we have payment rate to remain elevated here, which is a combination of the credit mix of the portfolio being at one of its best periods of time, number one. And then number two, having a lower percentage of promotional financing assets, which carry a lower payment rate, to the extent that we get some of that big ticket that I talked about and some of the bigger items, that will effectively slow down the payment rate as well as the credit mix can slow down the payment rate to give you an upward bias. So I think when you put the pieces together, again, NII should go up and NIM should go up, but again, it's how you factor those different moving parts together.

Operator

Our next question comes from Terry Ma with Barclays.

Terry Ma
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Maybe just a follow-up on PPPCs. Can you maybe just talk about how those are kind of tracking relative to your expectations? I think you had indicated about 75% should be kind of priced in by June of this year. And then, kind of going forward, like how much more lift can we expect through NIM kind of after 2026?

Brian Wenzel
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Terry, thanks for the question. I think when you take a step back to the -- and look at the PPPCs, I think as what we've said is we're slightly ahead of the burn-in of the APR changes to date because of the fact that the payment rate has been elevated. So the protected balance is paid down a little bit quicker. So again, you're probably a little bit ahead of that pace towards the 75% in the middle part of this year. Again, the back end of that curve, it's not as steep, right? So the growth will continue to bleed through. So I think that's developed. Other than coming in a little bit quicker, it's developed as we thought, right, relative to the various assumptions on attrition rates, et cetera. So we feel good about the PPPCs on the APR line.

When you think about on the paper statement fee line, I think that has settled in and to some degree has been relatively flat. And I think the combination of that is, even as you see the average actives pick up in the fourth quarter, it's the really growth in our e-bill, percentage of people who are electing digitally, which I think is a better thing for us as a company, not only for them to avoid the fee, but engage with us digitally. So we're seeing the benefit that's going to come through the expense line there. So when I look at that in combination, most certainly, I think we're pleased with the way the PPPCs have performed, and it's generally in line with our expectations.

Terry Ma
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Got it. Helpful. And then as my follow-up on the expense growth guide, that's in line with receivables. Maybe just talk about what sort of investments related to growth you're making? And then, after 2026, should we kind of expect kind of more positive operating leverage going forward?

Brian Wenzel
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So let me pull up and maybe address one broader point here, which is really the significant investments in growth we kind of highlighted here, which affect all the lines really in the P&L. The largest line when we talk about significant investments is going to be on the reserve line, right, really for the asset growth as you think about growing not only the Walmart portfolio, but obviously, Lowe's that comes in, in the first half, but also the new programs when you think about Bob's and RH, et cetera, that are kind of coming in. But the biggest piece is reserves.

I think when you think about the expense component of that, right, there's a couple of things that happen, right? You have launch costs associated with new programs. You invest in some of the early month on books and marketing programs associated with kind of getting a lot of new accounts up and running and engage as you think about that. So there's the launch costs, there's the conversion costs for certain portfolios. Then, you have most certainly the investment in marketing.

Also, from an expense standpoint, you really want to make sure you're investing, and we have to have the staffing in ahead of -- this is more a nonexempt standpoint to take the [ cost ] that come with it. All in all, those are really positive investments for growth and most certainly will pay back and will get that operating leverage. The one thing I'd say is we have increased our capital spend a bit. And that's really around, I'd say, 3 key areas.

Number one, it's around increased investment in AI and driving AI in various areas of the business, not only that drive productivity, but also drive growth for us, which is our focus, and we will certainly chat about that more. The second area is around our cloud journey and accelerating expenditures related to getting that done a little bit faster, so we can get the productivity and efficiency benefits that comes with that. And then third, Brian has talked quite a bit about our desire to continue to grow Health & Wellness at a faster pace. So investments in that Health & Wellness business. Those are the big pieces.

But again, if I go back to where I started on the significant investments, the biggest piece is reserves. But again, as you think about all the lines in the P&L, they're going to be impacted by growth. You're going to have -- as you think about the J-curve, you're going to have assets in there at a lower yielding as they go through maturity and seasoning. You're going to see it on the other income line when it comes into loyalty, maybe in advance of, again, some of the income coming off the assets and then expense line. When I think about the various pieces on the individual lines, they're less than 10 basis points, but they're on each of the lines. So that's why we kind of try to call it out as you guys model it. Again, these are all investments that we believe across the business really set us up for the longer term to be a much better company.

Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen.

Moshe Orenbuch
TD Cowen, Research Division

Great. Going back to kind of loan growth and opportunities. You mentioned adding the Pay Later gives you a lift. Can you talk a little bit about are there other areas, whether they're verticals or partners? And how much of the portfolio kind of could that impact over the course of '26?

Brian Doubles
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think, Moshe, I'll start just by talking a little bit about the multiproduct strategy because I think this has been very successful, I think, over the last couple of years. And Pay Later is an important part of that. It's resonating with our partners. We now have it at some of our largest partners, Lowe's, Amazon, Penney's, Belk, Sleep Number. And the accounts that we're seeing come through on that product are incremental. And I think that's great news, right? So we still have kind of the same flow of new customers coming into private label, co-brand, and the Pay Later customers are incremental, which means our partners are getting incremental sales. So they love that, obviously. So our partners are not looking at this as like an either/or. They're really now seeing the power of having these products kind of work in concert with one another.

And given customers have different financing needs, sometimes we're [ revolving ] products, the right product for them. Some may prefer fixed payments or installment product. And the strength of our franchise is we offer all of the above. So we really like how this is working. Like I said, it's resonating with our partners. It's helping us win new programs as well. And we can show them that kind of migration strategy. So we might be starting off a customer with a Pay Later account, getting comfortable with them and their payment behavior and then upgrading them to a private label card, ultimately a co-brand card with a larger line. So that's, like I said, really resonating with our partners, and we think that's the right strategy for the long term.

Moshe Orenbuch
TD Cowen, Research Division

Great. And maybe -- I mean, Brian, you did just reference kind of new programs. Can you talk a little bit about state of play? I mean, there are some start-ups that are in the space, but I think a lot of others have kind of pulled back. What are the areas you think that are most ripe kind of for new programs? And talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the market.

Brian Doubles
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Look, we've got a great pipeline across all of our platforms. We -- if you just look at last year, we added or renewed 75 partners. We renewed 7 of our top 20. I think -- and it's broad. It's across every industry, both existing programs, start-up programs. So we feel really good about our ability to compete. We're winning the deals that we want to win. I think this is back to a little bit of what Brian talked about, the investments that we're making are helping us stay ahead of the competition. Every RFP that we go into, we're told that our tech is best in the industry, our ability to integrate, our -- the investments we've made in our proprietary underwriting model, PRISM, those are all helping us win and compete in a business.

We are never going to be a low-cost provider. We're very clear on that upfront. We've made big investments in the business and the platform, and we need to earn a return commensurate with that. And we think that we're the best in the partner-based financing business. And we're proving that out every day with the deals that we're renewing, the partner base that we have and where we're adding new partnerships.

We will move next with Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America.

Mihir Bhatia
BofA Securities, Research Division

Maybe just first to start on the reserve rate. You're approaching day 1 CECL levels here. So just wondering -- I mean, I know obviously, you've tightened credit and it's gotten better. But just how are you thinking about the reserve rate level from here? Any thoughts into 2026 on how that would trend as you widen the credit aperture again?

Brian Wenzel
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Mihir, obviously, as we look at the reserve rate, clearly, it's come down, and most certainly, it's come down relative to the loss rate we've experienced. As you think -- as you look out into 2026, most certainly, we've given you the guide where we see unemployment rate rising here towards the end of the year, which is really the Moody's forecast. And most certainly, we maintained the qualitative overlays where you have an unemployment rate consistent with past quarters. So we have not eased off of that.

I think, as you look forward, the question becomes if you believe the macro environment becomes stable, at what point can the qualitative reserves kind of come down, which would end up giving you a little bit of a -- on a rate basis, a downward bias to the reserve rate. When that actually happens, it's a little bit unclear. I think we're at the closest that we've been to day one, not that that's necessarily the greatest anchor, but it's most certainly the first mile marker you look at of where your rate should be.

So I think we're encouraged around that, but obviously, a lot is going to depend upon how our -- number one, how our delinquency formation develops, and then, number two, the macro environment. So again, I would assume a little more downward bias on a rate basis. Obviously, as I talked about, the significant investments you're going to see on a dollar basis increase with the growth going back to the mid-single digits.

Mihir Bhatia
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. And then maybe just going back to the Pay Later conversation that you're just having. Can you just comment like on how the progress has been? I think you gave an impressive stat about 10% increase where it's offered side by side. Is that across all your platforms? And just -- maybe just comment, if you would, on Lowe's, Amazon, some of the big ones, any learnings from those rollouts that you can share on where you are with that process currently?

Brian Doubles
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think, look, generally, we're very pleased with the performance so far across all of the partners where we've launched it. I think going back to the multiproduct strategy, we believe that that's the right one. We're anchored in that strategy. The one question for us, like as we started to roll this out, I think the question for our partners was, would there be any cannibalization of the private label card and the dual card and co-brand cards that we offer. And the good news is there hasn't been. So we track that very closely across all of our partners where we have the multiproduct strategy in place.

And we can clearly see that the volume flowing through private label and co-brand is very consistent and that the Pay Later accounts that we're getting are net new. And I think that's great news. That allows us to attract a new customer base that ultimately we want to offer other products to. And so that was -- as we embarked on this a number of years ago, that was kind of the question that we were getting from our partners. We were pretty confident that this was going to attract a new customer base, and that's been the case so far. So we're very pleased across the board.

Operator

Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS.

L. Erika Penala
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Just wanted to clarify your response to Mihir's question. So within the $9.10 to $9.50, we should assume that the ALLL ratio is going to come down due to qualitative reserves coming down and that offsets perhaps the higher reserves from Walmart growth?

Brian Wenzel
Executive VP & CFO

Erika, so again, I was more giving the trajectory of the reserve. We haven't given guidance to what you actually should think about relative to -- or [ any of the comments ], to be honest with you, relative to the $9.10 to $9.50. It's over time that you have a downward bias to it. Again, on a dollar basis, most certainly, we would hope that the rate comes down to offset some of the growth, but we'll have to see how that plays out. But again, we have a very stable outlook here, which I think as you think about the reserve, I was just more talking about the trajectory over time. If you believe that the environment gets better, which again, we haven't -- on the assumptions we put on our outlook side, haven't -- aren't getting better. They're staying the same, Erika.

L. Erika Penala
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Got it. And just as a follow-up, you talked about the tax refund as a potential tailwind for purchase volume. I'm wondering, as we think about the inflection point in growth, and your assumption that payment rates stay high, one of your peers have talked about the tax refund in context more of better credit rather than better spend. And I'm wondering how have you sort of thought about the different scenarios in terms of how the tax refund dynamic could impact the payment rate?

Brian Wenzel
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. It's a great question. It's going to be interesting to see how it plays out. Most certainly, I think this tax refund season will be the one of the largest, if not the largest that we've seen. That's really a factor of the retroactive nature of some of the benefits that were passed in legislation in the middle of last year, number one. And number two, the withholding rates, which were not adjusted for 2025 will produce. Some people say between $500 and $1,000 incremental refunds off of -- with an average refund of, call it, between $3,000 and $4,000. So a significant amount of cash that flows in. That cash generally flows in, if you look at historical refunds, 50% to 60% comes by mid-March, 80% to 90% come by May. So you're going to see a large influx of cash into the economy.

I think, when you take a step back, Erika, and you look at where the benefits associated with the tax law changes, who do they affect when you think about whether it's the soft deduction, the childcare deduction, things like that, they're going to affect a certain part of the population that probably income skews a little bit higher. So when you think about a little bit higher, the higher people generally will sit back and say, okay, let me either save that or pay down debt. When you think about a more moderate income consumer, that consumer probably is either going to spend that money as it kind of comes through or not. So our impact on the payment rates really kind of goes back to our view on the consumer and what they're going to do. We're going to obviously track it very closely, but there's going to be a large influx of cash, again, in that end part of the first quarter into the second quarter that we'll look to see what it's doing.

Brian Doubles
President, CEO & Director

And I think the good news, look, both of those are positive outcomes for us. You go back to a few years, the stimulus payments, some consumers spent, and we saw an increase in purchase volume, some paid down debt, and we saw record low losses. So any kind of boost like that is a good result for us and will drive a little tailwind as we get into next year.

Operator

We will move next with Rick Shane with JPMorgan.

Richard Shane
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Look, you're calling for mid-single-digit loan growth and some degree of NII growth in 2026. Midpoint of EPS is flat despite the expectations of continued buybacks. And again, we're -- this is sort of revisiting Terry's question. RSA is up pretty significantly. It basically takes you back to pre-pandemic levels, which is consistent with pre-pandemic credit expectations. Implication is obviously that the efficiency ratio is higher in 2026. I'm trying to understand, I think, part is the RSA a function of sort of a pull forward, pay it forward on the new programs? And should we revert -- start to revert to normalized efficiency ratios in 2027 as that sort of pull forward anniversaries? How do we look at this going forward?

Brian Wenzel
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks for the question, Rick. I think, as you look at the model, as you try to put the pieces together, this is why we kind of called out some of the significant investments because what you are seeing is some of the early growth in some of the programs where you have the heavy reserve rate when you have assets that are not yielding as much because they're just in the early stage of the J-curve. It's just the nature of the businesses when you think about these vintages. And when you go from a flat growth rate to an accelerating growth rate, you see that, that vintage slow down on some of the lines.

The RSA, moving -- to a large degree, we have newer programs, they're not necessarily an RSA perspective, right, because of the early J-curve dynamics. So I think that ultimately normalizes. I think, as you step out, and what we expect as we go beyond 2026, obviously, would be moving closer back to the long-term framework on all the lines, we hope. And we'll certainly -- our goal is to grow the business at a double-digit EPS. I think the investments this year in moving from a flattish to down 1% to a mid-single digits gives you an EPS profile this year that's a little bit different. But again, we think that sets us up nicely for the medium to long term, and that's what our focus is on creating that value.

Richard Shane
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Brian, that's helpful. And so I think what you're steering me to understand is, hey, yes, it's a little bit RSA, but it's really the timing differential associated in part with the CECL reserving of the loan growth. Is that the best way to distill it?

Brian Wenzel
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean -- yes, Rick, I don't want to get into my tirade around my views on CECL and whether or not that's good accounting or bad accounting. I think we'll take up another hour. But most certainly, when you have to book those losses upfront before you get any earnings off the asset, to me, is not necessarily the right way to look at the business per se. That's why we kind of look at things without reserves first, and then, with reserves, obviously, because it's a GAAP basis. So -- but yes, CECL does dwarf the true reality a little bit.

Richard Shane
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Brian, it could be a short tirade you'd be preaching to the choir on that one.

Operator

We will move next with Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research.

Robert Wildhack
Autonomous Research US LP

One more on the Pay Later discussion. You sound quite positive on the uptake and conversion there. But I guess what I'm wondering is, is the translation from the top of the funnel and Pay Later to loan growth in any way different than the more legacy Synchrony product? I'm thinking that maybe Pay Later might be more of a onetime purchase versus a larger open-to-buy amount, maybe a smaller ticket on a per transaction basis. Any early indications you can share there?

Brian Doubles
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Look, I would say that it does tend to be a little bit more onetime, although we're seeing good repeat usage in Pay Later across the partners where we have it, which is encouraging. Ultimately, our goal and kind of where our partners want to be is to get them into that revolving product because I think that allows you to do life cycle marketing, push promotions, push offers. But we like -- look, the customers that are -- that take out a Pay Later loan, we're going to be front and center with them, offering another Pay Later loan to buy whatever it is they're buying next. So it's not that you can't do the life cycle marketing. It's just the little bit more natural in terms of how our partners think about it in the PLCC and co-brand space, but we like all 3 products. They're working really well in concert together. That was the thesis we were trying to prove out, and so far, we've proven it.

Brian Wenzel
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. The one thing, Rob, let me just add a little bit of a financial dimension to it, right? If you look at our entire portfolio, our entire portfolio turns just under 2, right, $100-plus billion of receivables on the purchase volume. I think when you tear that apart into pieces, obviously, the dual card and co-branded turn faster, private label turns a little bit slower. When you think about the Pay Later that we originate, we generally originate a majority in the 6 to 12 months. You got really -- it is probably the biggest part. You then see 18 to 24 months. So the turn is a little bit more consistent with, I'd say, private label. We do not do a lot of volume and don't really push anything below 6 months. We just -- it's hard to make money -- it's really impossible to make money, most certainly in the Pay in 4 and stuff like that. But think about it, it's going to be something more similar to a private label when you think about that type of duration. But again, we do Pay Later longer than that, but the book is going to be in the 6- to 12-month variety of installments.

Our next question comes from Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley.

Jeffrey Adelson
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Maybe just a follow-up on the credit actions or refinements, can you maybe just update us on your current posture at this point? Are you kind of continuing to lift off the prior tightening actions as you go along? Has that trend accelerated or maybe slowed it off from where you were earlier last year?

And then, Brian Wenzel, you mentioned the guide doesn't really include the additional broad-based credit refinements and that this would really depend on credit performance as it comes through. I guess, my question is, what maybe holds you back from opening up a bit more given that you're already within that historical charge-off range you target? You're perhaps getting a little bit of a positive bias in short order with tax refunds? Is this maybe just some conservatism you prefer to see the delinquency improvement to continue to come through before you maybe make a more definitive commitment there on the credit actions?

Brian Wenzel
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeff. Let me unpack that a little bit. First, let me remind you, the credit actions that we took in '23 and '24 were around very specific types of items. So you think about student loans, think about personal loans, things like that, that we thought about ability to pay. So some of the actions that we've taken in 2025 in the third and fourth quarter, we're not necessarily lifting off those because we think those are good strategies to have in place, but there are other strategies that have had the effect of adding sales or expanding your credit aperture. So I wouldn't necessarily refer to as we're just unwinding those because I think those do stay.

The reason why we haven't done incremental, and just to be clear, in our guide, the actions that we took in the end part of '25 are in the guide. No incremental broad-based changes are assumed for 2026, as we enter the year. The reason why -- if you're asking me why, why aren't we taking more and more because we have a 5.65% loss rate, delinquency looks good. I think when you look across the credit cohorts, the one thing that you'd see across all users, this isn't a Synchrony issue, probability of default across credit grades is higher than historical norms. So we benefit a little bit more because of our line structures and our ability to maintain a lower line structure and control that exposure at default. But most certainly, we're continuing to watch that probability default again across all the credit rates. It's not into one part. So it's how it normalizes.

And most certainly, there's a focus we've been tighter at the bottom end, which you've seen our shift a little bit less into non-prime is in that kind of right at the prime level. So that kind of advantage 650 to 700 and see what that customer who is feeling the effects of affordability for a number of years. So we're watching that probability of default across not only us, but across the industry.

Jeffrey Adelson
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. Great. And as my follow-up, it's nice to hear of the success you're having in Pay Later, and I think you mentioned that 6,200 merchants. So, I guess, maybe a different way of asking some of the other questions that have been asked. Is there a way to think about how you're -- how material that Pay Later offering can be for your forward loan growth, either the mid-single-digit growth you're looking for in the near term or the 7% to 10% long term you talk about? Is that something that could be 100 basis points or more of a pickup? And maybe just -- we've gotten some questions on progress of the Pay Later offering at Amazon, you launched earlier last year. I think we did notice that it's not available at the checkout anymore. Is there maybe just an update on how that program is going?

Brian Doubles
President, CEO & Director

Yes, sure, Jeff. Look, we can't get specific on any of our individual programs, but I would again just say we're very happy with the results on the product so far across all of our partners. We're seeing really strong growth in new accounts. Obviously, that's included in the loan guide. Again, it's a little bit about what Pay Later can deliver, but it's also that vehicle to bring in new customers and then migrate them over time. So it's obviously a big part of the strategy. It's included in the mid-single digits.

And I don't know, Brian, if you want to give a little more color?

Brian Wenzel
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think the one thing, Jeff, to understand about that product and of itself is the average ticket size and what that product is meant to do, and this is where Brian highlights the multiproduct strategy. The product fits a certain purchase type and a certain thing. You do not see as much a large ticket going into that 6- and 12-month with installment on a closed end. You generally see a smaller ticket size.

So when you see a smaller ticket size, the relative contribution when I think about a company that's got over $100 billion of receivable, it's not going to be as a meaningful driver to move the company's overall growth rate, but an important part for us to continue to expand penetration at our partners. So it's important to have that. Today, we have a bigger ticket offering, right, relative to equal pay installments. It just sits inside a revolving account, which is what you see primarily in our Home & Auto business or a little bit in our Lifestyle business and Health & Wellness. So, again, from a growth rate standpoint, again, given the denominator, I'd sit back and say the smaller ticket doesn't move the growth rate as fast right now. Again, it's important to have it as part of a holistic offering to our partners.

Our next question comes from Brian Foran with Truist.

Brian Foran
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

You've kind of touched on this throughout your comments, but just the decision on the guide to move from kind of the -- and I know, there's no standard the way you've done it, but generally, over time, you've given line items, and now, you're giving an EPS range with a little bit less line item detail. Is the conclusion you're happy with where consensus is on an EPS basis, but you're flagging some of the line items might need to change as people think through these investments for growth? Or I don't want to leave a witness, maybe you could just say why switch to an EPS range this year?

Brian Wenzel
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Brian, thanks for the question. This is an interesting -- it's an interesting question on how we try to help analysts understand the results of our company. And I think to a large degree, Brian, to be honest with you, with a large number of analysts, there's quite a diversity, and even though, we provided line item guidance, the outcomes on line items relative to the guidance how people built their model. So effectively, we said, listen, the best way for you to understand and value our company, ultimately, at the end of the day was to provide, as I sometimes call it, the cheat code on the test, which is what we think the EPS amount will be on the different line items. So it was more a factor of how do we try to get people to the best way to think about the performance of the company for 2026 than trying to get 5 line items right.

Brian Foran
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. And I think you mentioned the mid-single-digit loan growth is going to be a little bit more evident in the back half of the year. If that's right, what would you say are the 1 or 2 key markers we should watch for in the front half of the year that would show whether you're on track, above or below -- tracking above or below that kind of trajectory?

Brian Wenzel
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. It's a great question, Brian. I think the first thing you have to look at is what's purchase volume and what's the flow of volume that's coming into the system, number one. I think, number two, you got to watch your average actives and whether or not you see average active growth, and you think about sequential, whether it's purchase volume for average active, et cetera. So you can kind of step through and say, does the growth makes sense, right? Again, we're optimistic about what we saw here in the first 3 weeks of January. But those are the kind of 2 big mile markers I'd be looking at as you kind of come through. I mean, the payment rate will manifest itself ultimately in the turn of the portfolio and the receivables. But that's really -- you won't really see that until the end of period. Again, each of the monthly delinquency reporting credit, you'll get a snapshot of what average loan is doing and then most certainly what end of period is.

Brian Foran
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

If I could sneak in one last one, just on the tax refund thing, so is the conclusion that your best guess of the impact is included in the guide? Or to the extent there are benefits to your business from elevated tax refunds that would be incremental to the guide?

Brian Wenzel
Executive VP & CFO

Brian, I'm going to let you deal with Kathryn for going up beyond one extra question, but it is included in the guide.

And we have time for one more question. That question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.

Donald Fandetti
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Can you maybe just dig in a little bit on the Walmart partnership? I mean, obviously, that's going very well. Is this going to be just a steady ramp-up in loan growth? Are there any milestones? Or can you just maybe talk about how the rollout is going?

Brian Doubles
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Look, Don, it's going incredibly well. The program is fully launched in market, really strong early results. I mentioned fastest growth we've ever seen in the de novo program. There's a couple of things that I would highlight as you think about it. First, it is a leading-edge program from a tech perspective. So we're fully leveraging the OnePay app, which is a great app. We're leveraging our API stack. So we're completely embedded with a digital experience. The entire experience is inside the application all the way through when you apply for credit, all the way through servicing.

The second thing I'd highlight is it's got a very strong value prop on the card. So Walmart+ members get unlimited 5% cash back at Walmart, 1.5% cash back everywhere else. That's a big improvement and a big lift compared to how we're running the program when we last had it. And we're seeing it convert a lot of Walmart+ members, which is really great.

We've got really good digital in-store placement. You'll see that if you're on walmart.com. You'll see it if you're in the stores. And overall, I'd say we just have really good alignment, alignment to the deal structure. We're both incented to grow the program. So we couldn't be off to a better start, and we're really encouraged about what this is going to do for growth, not just in '26, but in the future.
