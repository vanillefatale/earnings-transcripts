Question-and-Answer Session

John Pitzer
Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning & Investor Relations

[Operator Instructions] With that, Jonathan, can we please take the first question?

Operator

Certainly. And our first question for today comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.

Ross Seymore
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I guess the first one is 2 quick parts. It's both on supply. In the short term, are the yield improvements and the other actions you're taking sufficient to address just typical seasonality throughout the year given that usually the first quarter would be the low point on revenues?

And then perhaps more importantly, longer term on the supply side, you guys seem more confident in your 14A, your 18A, the customer engagements, your internal road map, when would you decide to loosen up the reins on the CapEx side of things so that you could address structurally higher demand going forward with more internal supply?

David Zinsner

Thanks, Ross, for the question. So on the short-term supply, certainly, improving yields and throughput are a great driver of supply increases. In fact, it's got a great ROI to it because it doesn't require any incremental capital. So that's what Lip-Bu and I are actively working on to improve and we're reasonably confident that there's a good trajectory there.

That said, when you look at CapEx, it's a little bit more nuanced than just it's going to be flat to slightly down. It's actually down significantly in space. So we're spending a lot less in space. We think we have a good footprint in terms of cleanroom. And what we're devoting more of our dollars to is tool. So we are ramping up tool spending quite a bit in '26 relative to '25 to address this supply shortfall as well.

And in fact, every quarter, we're seeing kind of wafer start increases pretty much across the board across Intel 7, Intel 3 and 18A. So all 3 of them every quarter improve and get better to address the supply. Like I said, we think we -- things will certainly improve in 2Q but we won't be completely out of the woods here. But as we progress through the year, we think things will get better and better. Do you want me to take 14A thing or...

Yes. On 14A, Lip-Bu has been very direct with us on all of this. He does not want to spend on capacity on 14A only spend on the kind of TD spend or R&D spend associated with 14A even in the fab until we have customers secured. We've talked about, the likelihood is, our customers on 14A their window to secure or for us to secure them will be in the back half of this year and in the first half of next year. And so once visibility improves there, we'll start to unlock the spend on 14A.

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

I can just add a little bit more. I think on the yield improvement, which we see in the 7%, 8% yield improvement per month. I think it's more in focus in the variation, make sure that we can be more consistent delivery and also the defect density at the end so that we can ship quality wafer to the customer. So I think all those are very important for our PC client, Panther Lake and then also for the 18A and 14A development. So I think, all in all, I see improvement but still not quite to the industry-leading standard yet.

John Pitzer
Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning & Investor Relations

Ross, do you have a quick follow-up?

Ross Seymore
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Yes, I do. The gross margin side, Dave, you gave some puts and takes for the full year on a bunch of different metrics but you didn't mention gross margin. How should we think about that? And forgive me, the 40% to 60% incremental, I know you guys give kind of -- you can drive a truck through. So anything perhaps just a little more precision directionally, it would be helpful.

David Zinsner

I'm not even sure the math is that good on this time around. When you look at Q1, the gross margin decline in Q1, there's 2 main components. Obviously, revenue coming down with a largely fixed cost business is going to affect gross margins. But the other piece of it is Panther Lake, while the cost structure improves from Q4 to Q1, it's still dilutive to the corporate average, and it's a bigger percentage of the mix. So it actually has a relatively negative impact on gross margin. So that's partly why we're guiding down. There's some mixed things going on as well.

I think as we progress through the year, the 2 things should benefit us. One, we improve our supply, ergo, that should improve our revenue picture. On top of that, Panther Lake's cost structure gets better and better. Look, we talked about the incremental improvement every month, we're going to see in yields. We're working on the throughput as well. So those 2 things combined, that should help in terms of cost structure and make this more of an accretive product to us as opposed to a diluted product.

And I think that will be a lot of what is the story around gross margins for the year. There's still mix and mix can go in any different direction depending on how things play out. But what we're largely focused on for the kind of the next 12 months is driving the cost structure of these products that we're building to improve the margins. We know that 34.5% is by no means an acceptable level of gross margins. And we're actively working it, first to get it to 40% and then once we get it there, we'll move to a new target.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri from UBS.

Timothy Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Dave, I'm wondering in the guidance, you're guiding to $12.2 billion, but I'm wondering if you can kind of pro forma that for us like if you could meet all the demand, what would the kind of unconstrained guidance be for March?

David Zinsner

Yes. It's a squishy figure to figure out, Tim, but I would tell you that if you look at kind of that $12.2 billion relative to the $13.7 billion, we posted in the fourth quarter, and look at normal seasonality. It's in the range of seasonal but it's at the low end of that range of seasonal, we'd be well above seasonal if we had all the revenue or supply, I should say, to hit the revenue.

John Pitzer
Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning & Investor Relations

Tim, do you have a follow-up?

Timothy Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I do, thanks. Lip-Bu, there's obviously a lot of excitement about your foundry business. It sounds like we might get a few customer announcements maybe in the second half. But I just wanted to ask you, what do you define as like success in that business. I think prior to you arriving, the mantra was sort of to be #2, the #2 foundry player by 2030. If you look at most of the forecast for that #2 player at somewhere in the range of like $30 billion and revenue up by that time. Is this still kind of a reasonable bogey that you're shooting for? And like what do you consider as a successful outcome for that.

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks,. Good question. So I think we are determined to commit to drive the world-class foundry business. So I think, first of all, on the 14A, I think we clearly, development is on track. We like what we see. And we simplify the whole process flow. Most important is kind of building up the IP portfolio so that we can serve the customer.

Some of the IP is very critical in order to serve the customer. The other part is on the yield and improvement. We see a trend of improvement, and we also see the valuations getting better. I think in the long run, I think clearly, we are kind of anticipating the -- we have heavy engaging in some of the key customers. We think that the second half of this year, they're going to indicate to us what kind of capacity firm commitment so that we can deploy the capacity CapEx to really build that.

So I think all in all, I think it's a service business, We really built a trust and the consistency we're able to deliver. And then we have the PDK on the 14A first quarter, 0.5. And then we're starting to engage with customers with the key products that they want to run with us. So I think all in process. I think in the second half of this year, we were able to have the commitment that we can really drive the scale of the operation.

David Zinsner

Another early indicator, I think, of success in the foundry is going to be advanced packaging. And we'll start to see that revenue come in even before we start to see meaningful wafer revenue. And I think as I was talking to investors over the past kind of 12 to 18 months, I was thinking that those opportunities would be measured in hundreds of millions of dollars and wafer opportunities would be measured in billions.

I'd say some of the early customer engagements suggest that we'll be well north of $1 billion on many of these opportunities for advanced packaging. So they're way more exciting than even I had expected. And it's because we have really good technology there that's very differentiated and supports AI in a way that is particularly special.

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

I think the EMIB-T, I think, is a very big differentiator for us. And then clearly, we have a couple of customers willing to even prepay the subscript -- because [ subscript ] is very big supply shortage and then they're willing to share with us. That means that show the commitment they are going to be working with us.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.

Joseph Moore
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes. I wonder if you could talk about server prospects. You sort of talked about some of the challenges of Diamond Rapids not having symmetric multi-threading and Copper Rapids is going to be important. Can you give us a time frame on Copper Rapids and sort of what's your expectation for the potential for market share puts and takes as you wait for that to come?

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

Yes, good question. So I think, first of all, I would centralize the data center and AI under Kevork that I hire in to help us to build that. He already built the team and then include some of the -- recruit some of the talent on board. I think the more important right now, we are laser-focused in 16 channels Diamond Rapid and we simplify the product road map.

And then the other part is accelerate the introduction of Coral Rapid. And Coral Rapid will have the reintroduced the multi-thread into our data center workforce. So I think overall, we are very positive. The team is in place now. The road map is very clear, and we are very decisive for doing that. and are laser focus on the Diamond Rapid 16-channel and also accelerate the Coral Rapid introduction.

John Pitzer
Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning & Investor Relations

Joe, you have a quick follow-up?

Joseph Moore
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes, sure. And just in terms of the mix for the rest of the year, are you able to move wafers towards data center away from PC? Is that something that you're thinking about and just -- it seems like the constraints are at their worst point in Q1 and get better, but I assume you're still constrained beyond that. Are you able to move the mix towards data center?

David Zinsner

We're absolutely constrained, Joe. So what we're doing within client we're focusing on the mid- and high end and not as focused on the low end. And then to the extent we have excess, we're pushing all of that into the data center space to meet that customer demand. And I think you'll see some share adjustments based on that because our primary focus is to our main customers.

And obviously, we have important customers in the data center side. We have important OEM customers. on both data center and client and that needs to be our priority to get the limited supply we have to those customers.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius.

Benjamin Reitzes
Melius Research LLC

My first question is about seasonality throughout the year. So Dave and Lip-Bu. I mean you're subseasonal in the first quarter, you said you'd be well above seasonal if you had the supply. So what does that imply for 2Q to 4Q? Should we model that above seasonal or are the constraints in PC so much that we shouldn't, thanks.

David Zinsner

Yes, I mean, we would expect to be better than seasonal through the year if we can get the supply to where we think we can as we get into 2Q. So that's correct.

John Pitzer
Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning & Investor Relations

Ben, do you have a follow-up question?

Benjamin Reitzes
Melius Research LLC

Sure. I wanted to ask about, with regard to the hyperscaler situation in servers. It's -- in terms of your momentum there, is this mostly driven by hyperscaler? Or do you feel like the shortage is mostly impacting them, making you sub seasonal? Or is the enterprise demand also are you seeing it there?

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

Yes. I think, let me answer that question. I think the hyperscaler is very important for us to scale the business, and I spent a lot of time with the hyperscalers. I think a couple of thing. One, clearly, message from them is the CPU actually is driving a lot of that business in terms of the different workloads that they're driving. So I think it's very encouraging to see that they are willing to commit long-term agreement. So we really prioritize deployment. So that something is very positive.

And then secondly, I think they are very excited about working with us in terms of decide working on the silicon the software and the system level engagement, and that something is also very exciting. So all in all, I think they are very strong. The workload, they shared with us what they're looking at and what can be helping them. And also the ASIC design also is an opportunity for us.

They also want to build some of the purpose-built silicon with the Xeon CPU included. And also, they are very interested about overall, how do you use the advanced packaging and then to make it more complete. I think overall, I think it's a great opportunity for us to work with them.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.

Stacy Rasgon
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

For my first question, I wanted to dig a little bit into the segments. So I mean if I sort of run the math, like Mobileye is going to be up and the Altera foundry revenues maybe close to a couple of hundred million dollars I mean both DCIA and client to be down pretty meaningfully. And the client's down more -- I mean maybe DCIA is down high single digits and clients' down like mid-teens. But I guess, number one, is that true?

And number two, like why should data center be down so much given where the demand is and given where you're prioritizing, like why would I expect data center units to be down? It seems like they have to be down pretty meaningfully in Q1.

David Zinsner

Yes. I mean, both will be down as a function of supply. Obviously, we're shifting as much as we can over the data center to meet the high demand. But we can't completely vacate the client market. So we're trying to support both as best we can and obviously work our way out of this supply issue. I do believe that the first quarter is the trough. We will improve supply in the second quarter.

And part of the challenge is that in the third and fourth quarter of '25, we lived off of supply, but we also had a reasonable chunk of fixed finished goods inventory to also work through. Unfortunately, that is now down to kind of 40% of what it was at peak levels. So we don't have that to rely on. So it's just literally hand to mouth, what we can get out of the fab and what we can get to customers is how we're managing it.

John Pitzer
Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning & Investor Relations

Stacy, do you have a follow-up question?

Stacy Rasgon
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

I do. I mean just to push on that a little bit. I mean, you guys have your own factories, like why are you in the inventory situation that you're in? And then -- I mean, even if you look at -- I get the whole idea about finished goods versus other stuff. But I mean like you have $11.6 billion of inventory. And yet, it's not in the right place at the right time to sit like how does that happen?

David Zinsner

That's largely a win. I'll tell you, Stacy. I think the biggest thing is that we if you go back 6 months or so ago and looked at what the outlook was. Core count was absolutely looking like it would increase. but the units were not expected to increase. And every hyperscaler customer we talked to was signaling that. And obviously, it has rapidly increased over the third and fourth quarter. And in talking to a few of them right before this call, I got the feeling like it was going to be a story we'd feel for several years.

And yes, the advantage we have is we do have our own fab so we can squeeze out supply as much as possible, which is what we're working on, but we directionally weren't managing the supply to an expectation that there would be unit increased that significantly in data center.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities.

Vivek Arya
BofA Securities, Research Division

For the first one, Lip-Bu, I'm curious, when do you think Intel should start getting any credit for external foundry efforts because you mentioned that you might hear of awards in the second half of this year. I assume that you start building the capacity for that, right, sometime late this year or next year. So when do you actually start to get a decent amount of revenue from those customers. And I think you mentioned that building this business will take incremental amount of resources. So what level of external foundry revenue does Intel need to call this business a success? And when do you get that? Is it '27? Is it '28? Is it later?

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

Yes. Good question. I think first of all, I think the engagement with our potential external customer on the 14A are very active right now, a couple of key customers working with us. We expect them to really go through the milestone basis on 0.5 PDK and then starting to look at the test chip and look at how is our yield performance. And it's going to be a process to work with them.

And then I think the second half of the year, then they're starting to satisfy, then they're going to asking us, okay, now this is the particular product we're going to run with your foundry and the production. And then the indication to us and that's the time my discipline is until they have a commitment to the volume, then I starting to really build and the foundry expansion so that we can meet their requirement.

And then the other part parallelly, they also give us a list of IP. If it's a mobile related, you have to be low power IP that we need to have. If it is data center related, it clearly will be the performance, the connectivity, all these things that we need to really get it ready so that we can serve the as a service as a customer to meet their requirement. So it's parallelly on the IP readiness and also our yield readiness that is think satisfied.

Okay. Now this product. This is a volume we're going to run with you. and that's how you're starting to build. So -- in terms of 14A, realistically in terms of, I call it, the risk production in the later part of 2027 and real production, volume production in 2028. That is similar to the same time frame as a leading foundry.

David Zinsner

And I'd just say, we probably will be able to give you a lot more color around all of these things at the Analyst Day that Lip-Bu mentioned will have in the back half of the year.

John Pitzer
Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning & Investor Relations

Vivek do you have a follow-up question?

Vivek Arya
BofA Securities, Research Division

For my follow-up, I'm curious, what do you think is the server CPU TAM in 2026? How much of that is x86? How much of that is ARM? I mean if you are supply constrained, is the entire industry supply constrained? Do you think that whatever you can't supply all that market share is going to go to your x86 competitor and to everyone in the AI community that is building ARM-based servers. So like when do you think your supply -- how much does the market grow? And when do you think your server CPU supply constraints come off?

David Zinsner

Okay. Maybe I'll start and you -- so I think this demand, what we're seeing is largely in x86 phenomenon because it's an upgrade cycle in a lot of ways around older networks that have to talk in some way to the AI systems and the performance is not where it needs to be. So I really view this as x86. Of course, we do have another competitor in the space, and we'll be jockeying for position from a market share perspective.

I think we will make great strides on the supply as we progress through the year. So I wouldn't envision that to be the fundamental driver ultimately a market share. And it's really about products and Lip-Bu talked about getting to a 16-channel Diamond Rapids out, accelerating the introduction of Coral Rapids. Those will be the things that are most important for us as we look at market share dynamics in the coming years.

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

I think from my side, I think clearly, hyperscale and the high-end OEM, ODM is critical for us on the server side. And then we're basically working with them. Their first choice is the CPU from Intel. And that is a very clear message from them. They will try to get as much as we can give them. And then I think that's the key home driver.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald.

Christopher Muse
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

I guess a follow on Stacy's question around supply. Considering your bullish commentary and AI-led demand and how you're supply-constrained and your peers, TSMC and Samsung Taylor are aggressively slotting for equipment delivery. Do you worry that if you wait for late 2026 to place orders that the lead times then might be longer than you thought? And as part of that, why wouldn't you look to be more aggressive today?

David Zinsner

Yes, maybe I don't know if this is the answer to your question, but I mean we are aggressively getting tools on Intel 710, Intel 3 18A, that is happening. And we will be increasing our wafer starts as aggressively as possible on those nodes. What we're holding back on is 14A because 14A is really linked to foundry customers, and it does not make sense to build out significant capacity there until we know that we have the customers that will accept that demand.

And so that's just the discipline we're going to have. I'd say the other thing with regard to a lot of this around supply is, Lip-Bu's first focus and our short-term focus is we think we gain a lot of supply just by doing things better with our existing tools and footprint, getting yields improved, getting cycle times improved and we're aggressively working on that. And we think there's lots of opportunity to improve our supply just on those 2 things that don't require CapEx, quite honestly. And that's something that's probably more unique to us right now than to other foundries.

John Pitzer
Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning & Investor Relations

C.J., do you have a follow-up question?

Christopher Muse
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

Yes, John. Just to hit on the press release, you talked about demonstrating technical feasibility on High NA for future HVM. And so just curious, is that something you're still contemplating for 14A? Or is that more of a 10A adoption?

David Zinsner

It will be part of our 14A process. Of course, there will be different variants of 14A, but High NA is targeted at 14A.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.

Harlan Sur
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Lip-Bu, as you look forward to 14A, you talked about engineering engagements with customers. And typically, the largest fabless semiconductor companies in the world want to run their own test chips to assess the new foundry node, and they typically wait for PDK 0.4 or 0.5 before they start their test chip designs, it looks like they can get started now on test chip design with the release of your PDK 0.5.

So I guess the question is, have customers commence test chip designs or are they maybe even further along than that and customers are already running their own 14A test chips now? I mean, in order for them to make decisions on 14A in the second half, they need to be running their test chips fairly soon. So if you give us an update there?

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

Yes, good question. So I think you're absolutely correct. A couple of customer we are already engaging about the PDK 0.5 and they are looking at the test chip. And also more important is a specific product they're going to run to our fab foundry. And that one, we are working with them. And then, of course, they want to know the capacity, the pricing, those are all in the discussion right now. So that's why I mentioned the second half of this year, they're starting to satisfy, then they can starting to say, okay, now we need this volume and we need particular fab from yours to do it.

And then also the other part is, do we have all the right IP to serve them? And so those are the things that we are parallelly proces with their supply chain and also their design teams to work with them. So this is a very complex steps and that we are very familiar, we are working in the right way.

John Pitzer
Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning & Investor Relations

Harlan, do you have a follow-up question, please?

Harlan Sur
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. On your server portfolio, I apologize if I missed this earlier, but Clearwater Forest, right, your E-core sort of cloud workload optimized server platform that was targeted to be the first server platform to use your 18A manufacturing and ramp first half of this year. But Lip-Bu talked about server road map changes to focus on more performance-focused products. So is the team still supporting Clearwater Forest? Or just focusing now on Diamond Rapids? And has the team taped out or taped in your next-gen Xeon 7 Diamond Rapids products and any preliminary views on ramp timing of Diamond Rapids?

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

Yes. So answer to your question is, yes, we continue to do this and support that. And what I mentioned about focus on the 16-channel of Diamond Rapid is kind of focus on the high end of the Diamond Rapids so that we can really laser focus and really providing a differentiating competitive products. And then the other part is, as I mentioned in the past, this multi-threading is very important in terms of driving the performance. And the one that we can really come out with and it takes time to have that and we're going to have that in the Coral Rapid.

Now the question mark is how can -- how much can we accelerate that they put in earlier customer is really excited about that, "Lip-Bu, can you pull it up earlier." That's why I work with Kevork and his team see how -- what are the way we can really drive that acceleration to bring the market -- to bring the customer earlier.

Operator

And our final question for today then comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.

Aaron Rakers
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I have 2, if I can fit them in. But on the memory side and what we're seeing in the market, I'm curious of how you guys are seeing customers react to memory? Is there a potential demand disruption in the PC market? Just any kind of curiosity on what you're seeing in that? And how impactful is memory pricing to the gross margin, given obviously, I think, stronger for longer Lunar Lake demand.

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

Yes, good question. So I think industry facing a very big challenge is the memory constraint and also the pricing. So I think we also listen to our customers, some of the bigger players and in the OEM and the bigger player in the hyperscale, they have more access into the memory locations. So we kind of hear from them.

And then secondly, I think some of the smaller ones, they are really challenging to scramble to get the memory. So I think that will be very important for us, Dave and I, how to allocate and also our sales great in how to allocate to the right customer. We don't want to have a CPU, we sent to them, but they are missing the memory, they cannot complete the products. So we try to do it correctly and then -- that is very important to have that intelligence and then also feedback from the customer to work with us and so that we can fulfill their requirement. Dave?

David Zinsner

Yes. I think on the Lunar Lake side, I think we've got what we need based on the current forecast, of course, that could always tick up, and then we would need more memory which would kind of impact gross margins. But we were relatively aggressive in terms of getting the memory early. So I feel like we're in a relatively good place there. Now that said, those margins are low because the memory is packaged. So that is an impact to our gross margins as well. But I think we're largely in the place we thought we would be a quarter or 2 ago.

John Pitzer
Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning & Investor Relations

Aaron, do you have a quick follow-up?

Aaron Rakers
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I do, and I'll be really quick. I'm curious on the custom ASIC side, you talked about hitting $1 billion of run rate business. How do we think about the progression of that? And how broad is the customer base within that opportunity set?

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

Good question. I think Dave mentioned earlier, is a $100 billion TAM market opportunity. And we are delighted. We are already in the run rate of $1 billion. It's a robust demand and customers really excited about what we have in terms of the CPU Xeon and also the AI-related momentum. So they're more building a purpose build, silicon for AI and network and cloud.

And that part, I think we continue to work on that. And also more important for them is also the advanced packaging, make that more compelling. And that's the advantage of Intel that we can do both to provide customer delight. And so that, I think, is a good opportunity for us.

So with that, thank you again for joining us today. As we move forward, I remain focused on disciplined execution and deep collaboration with our customers to seize the meaningful opportunity created by AI era. While we have a lot more to do, we are confident in the foundation that we built and the progress underway. We're looking forward to provide you another update in April.

Operator

Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.
