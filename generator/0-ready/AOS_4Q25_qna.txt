[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.

Jae Hyun Ko
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

This is James on for Saree. I wanted to ask on the residential guidance here. Your outlook is calling for a flattish to down kind of industry volume here for 2026. And I think then this marks kind of third year. So flattish to decline in volumes which we haven't really seen for a while. So can you kind of provide me details on what is making this downturn or weakness kind of more persistent? And can you provide more details on what you're kind of seeing in the market generally?

Charles Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks for the question. So just overall, as we look into 2026, there was really 3 components as we think about it, right? We have the emergency replacement, which is very resilient, very reliable, very predictable, and we expect that to continue. We have proactive replacement, which we've talked about being fairly high for the last 5 or 6 years. We feel like that's pretty resilient at this point. It's -- it's been out there for 5 years at above 30% of total replacement. And so we're expecting that to continue. Where we're seeing some headwind is kind of the new home completions, multifamily and single family. We see pressure on that as we go into next year. So yes, we've had a couple of years of flat volumes coming off some better growth years earlier that were a little lumpy due to COVID. But the pressure we're seeing next year is really in the new home construction, which we feel like without some stimulus with a lower interest rate or perhaps some velocity on new home sales is going to be a bit of pressure on our top line residential volumes.

Jae Hyun Ko
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. And I guess I wanted to ask a question on China. I think your guidance kind of implies like double-digit decline in first half and then return to growth here. What specific like indicators are kind of giving you confidence that it can kind of -- what is the return to growth in the second half?

Stephen Shafer
President, CEO & Director

Yes, some of it is we've got to work through a period where there was a lot of government subsidies that were driving some demand generation. So that's the challenge we're going to face in the first half of this year is we're now comping against that. The return to growth will be partly driven by as we move past that phase and we get back to the remodel wins and the refurbishments that still need to happen in China. And part of it is some of our own actions internally to get behind and focus and drive growth in certain areas.

Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird.

Michael Halloran
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

So can we first start on just the comments, Steve, you made about increased competitive intensity in the wholesale channel. Maybe just a little bit more context of 2 things, I suppose. One, what does it mean in terms of the price, share, et cetera, in that channel? And then secondarily, when you net the 2 together, with the strength you have on the retail side, how is that balancing out all else equal to give both the narrow view and the wholesale, but then draw it back to the -- how that's impacting the cumulative market.

Stephen Shafer
President, CEO & Director

Sure. I'll start by saying, as I mentioned, we have meaningful share in both the retail and wholesale side. So from that standpoint, we participate when there's kind of movement between the two. I would say specifically on wholesale, Mike, right, I mean, the dynamic of low new home construction, which we just talked about and the fact that retail has made some inroads in terms of share gains overall in the industry is just putting pressure on that part of the channel. And any time you've got kind of pressure that way where there's limited growth or even there's some declines, it just makes it a more competitive environment. And from what we see right now, it's not really driven by a lot of kind of new entrants into the space. It is primarily the kind of the leaders that serve the wholesale channel today.

And it's not new that there's dynamics playing out across the channel in terms of different partners and how that works. I would say it's a bit accelerated a bit in the last 6 months in particular, just because of the pressure that's been in that market. And I think as we look at it, and this is, again, another area where because we are such a large player in the space, we know all the industry participants. We know all the different distribution partners. We know where those pressures are the greatest, and that's really our focus going forward. So we obviously were happy with the gains we've made on the retail side and with our partners over there. We think we can do better on the wholesale side to serve that market, and that's what our focus is going to be here right now.

Michael Halloran
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

And then maybe just some help with the cadencing through 2026 cumulatively. You have a lot of moving pieces front half to back half. So any thoughts on how the earnings and revenue should cadence relative to normal seasonality? Any 1H, 2H dynamics that are worth mentioning? Any help would be appreciated.

Charles Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So yes, as you look at 2026, Mike, it's going to look a little different than '24 and '25. Both those years, '24 and '25, on the residential side, in particular, on commercial water heating, we had price increases that pulled volume forward in the front half of the year. So '24 and '25 cadence on the residential water heating side was 53% in the front half, 47% in the back half. We look at 2026 and expect a much more normalized year, maybe closer to 50-50 or 51-49. So there will be tough comps in the front half of the year, both compared to '25 and '24 on the water heating side. As you also step into next year, our 2026 input costs, we're looking at those very closely. Steel should be up -- is expected to be up about 10%. And as you know, we have pretty good visibility into that in our forward view of what our pricing is. We'll have carryover tariffs into the first half of the year and other costs are also causing a bit of headwind.

And then thinking about China, and we've talked a lot in the past about the cadence in China, as Steve said, a bit around -- we'll see pressure in the first half of the year because the subsidy program was in place. In 2025 this year beginning -- actually beginning midyear last year, it was discontinued, and that's why we saw weakness in the back half of this year. We expect that to continue into next year until there's some traction. We think there was some pull ahead into the marketplace and expect some of that traction to come back perhaps in the second quarter or midyear. As you know, the first quarter is always a challenge in China because of the Chinese festival New Year. We expect that to be a little bit more accentuated this year because of discontinuance of the subsidy program. And then return to, I would say, in the back half of the year for China, kind of the normal, a little bit better in the third quarter and your outlook expects it to be improved in the fourth quarter like it historically has been with some of the holiday shopping.

Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Mitchell Moore
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

This is Mitch Moore on for Jeff. First, I was just wondering if you could give a bit more color on Leonard Valve, the go-to-market strategy, what end markets they play in? And maybe how much growth the $70 million in sales you're expecting this year, like what growth rate that reflects.

Stephen Shafer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. In terms of the end markets, they're very strong in kind of the commercial markets, which was appealing to us. They serve in some ways, like with their Heat-Timer controls business. It's very much a spec-in-driven business, very similar to like our Lochinvar business. In fact, we show up on a lot of the same spec sheets together. So there's a similar go-to-market model that way. And there's just overlap in a lot of the channels, both in the representatives who take our products to market and in distribution as well. So it's close to our categories in that way. And then on the actual way the product is used, it interacts into the ecosystem similar to our products.

So it's down in the mechanical rooms where our products are often found. And I think that similar trades and contractors operate with the product. So from that standpoint, it's a very close adjacency in terms of product expansion. And I think it's what's got us excited strategically that there's both ways we can work together and serve the market better and how we go to market, but also ways in which we can innovate and find ways that our products can interface and create better solutions for our customers.

Charles Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

As far as growth rate, the business has been growing double digits. So in that 10% range, it's kind of baked into how we think about the growth rate, largely driven by the digital portion of the market that they serve.

Mitchell Moore
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Great. That's helpful. And I know there's a lot of moving pieces around price cost, just with tariffs and lapping price increases and whatnot. But can you maybe just give some thoughts about how you expect price cost to trend through the year?

Charles Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean, Steve had comments around the competitive nature of what's happening in the marketplace today. We certainly also -- we also commented that we have some carryover pricing that we expect to carryover in the next year. And historically, and I'll say we do a really good job of protecting our price cost relationship. So we do expect that to continue over time. Also historically, we generally see some fade. We'll be watching that closely. I'll just kind of say that we're very committed to making sure in the competitive environment that we keep our customers competitive, and we'll be focused on that.

Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer.

Bryan Blair
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

It would be great to -- I guess following up on Leonard Valve, it would be great to hear a bit more about the build-out and prospects of your water management platform. I guess how should we think about TAM expansion given the new products and applications that are involved there or potential there? And in what way is LVC foundational to the build-out? And again, given the right opportunities, how aggressive would your team like to be on incremental M&A?

Stephen Shafer
President, CEO & Director

I mean we're excited about the way we're defining kind of the water management market. As I mentioned, it's kind of thinking about how does water move, mix, get controlled through the ecosystem of residential and commercial. We play an important part in that today with the categories of our water heaters and boilers. And I think there's a lot of other products that help make that happen. And so we're still early in our journey of kind of shaping up where the right places are for us to participate. So your question around TAM, I think what we're excited about, that it does open us up to bigger market opportunities. We've got what we think is an exciting and healthy pipeline of where we could go to do that. Obviously, when it comes to acquisition, there's a lot of things that have to come together to make that work, but we think our reputation in the industry helps us because we're a good spot for good high-quality companies to kind of come together around in how we serve the market.

And I think there will be those near-term opportunities as we think about how we go together into the marketplace, provide these products that are well established categories today. And then longer term, I think it creates more growth for us because it allows us new ways to create value for our customers. Today, we do that in a meaningful way by driving more efficiency and performance in the water heater and boiler products that we serve the market. But if you think about how commercial customers use our products and are thinking about things like energy efficiency more broadly, having a way to serve the market with an ecosystem, I think is a way to create more value.

Bryan Blair
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And then you noted the strategic assessment of China is ongoing. So we know there isn't a definitive update, but you did mention a number of potential partners. I was just curious if you could offer any other color on direction or whether new options or considerations have narrowed and whether there's any connection to any of the incremental turnaround actions that are underway there.

Stephen Shafer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I'd say we're moving with urgency because we know when we talk about an assessment of the business, right, we're still running the business, and we have employees and customers that we want to provide some confidence and certainty to. But I would say, while we do that with urgency, we're also being thoughtful to do it in the right way. And our goal, again, is to make sure that we set the business up to be as competitive as possible going forward. I can't get into the specifics of the folks that we're necessarily working with. But we are learning, I think, a lot about other options out there on what we can pursue. I think, as I mentioned, the quality of the conversations have been terrific. Our local team in China has been very active and involved in that to make sure we're thinking about things the right way. And we'll continue to move that forward, and we'll continue to update you guys as we learn more. But at this point, we don't have anything in terms of how we've narrowed the scope in terms of what potential options and outcomes could come from it. But I'm pretty happy that we're -- the process itself has been very helpful for us.

Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.

David S. MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

I guess I want to start by talking about -- I wanted to begin by asking about the water treatment business. You called out the 400 basis points of margin improvement in 2025, which is quite an accomplishment. And maybe you could maybe talk a little further about just sort of the composition of that improvement. And I guess, as well, just where now in terms of where those margins go? And at one point, I think the goal had been to grow those margins at about 100 basis points a year through a variety of different initiatives. And how are you thinking now about kind of multiyear annual profitability growth in that business?

Stephen Shafer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We like the space. And for A. O. Smith, we entered in it 8 years ago because we understood the megatrends, and we felt like there was a lot we could bring into the space in terms of how we run our businesses. To kind of build the platform, we made a number of acquisitions. And I think what we've done recently is we've now taken kind of a state of what have we learned through the businesses that we bought and through running the businesses, and that helped define for us a little bit of our journey and our path going forward. And as we've been talking about for the last year or so, part of it was prioritizing which part of the market we wanted to really focus on and invest in. And that's been obviously a little bit of a growth drag for the business as we've decided to deprioritize some things. The end of 2024, we took some restructuring charges to help reorient that business.

And now I think what we're excited about is that we know the spaces in the market where we really want to focus and play. And that's helping us drive a more profitable part of the business. Also the growth in the spaces where we want to play, we're very pleased with. And then also along with that, is the natural path of just sort of learning how to kind of integrate the businesses, take advantage of levers you can pull to create value by doing that. And that, I think, is a journey we're still on. And going forward, I think -- like I said, I think we're focused on where we want to play. We think we can continue to really add value into the water treatment market. We're excited about where this business can go. We're still very excited about the market opportunities overall. And we think we can continue, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, to drive meaningful growth with this business as well as continue to expand margins as we scale and as we continue to pull levers on integrating the business.

David S. MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

Can you offer any sort of thought on where those margins might be today versus sort of the North American segment averages? And then I have a follow-up.

Charles Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean so the margins today at 400 expansion of basis points kind of takes you into the ZIP code of about 13% operating margins. And you know our North America margins are at 24.4% this year. So expanding it to another 200 basis points gets us to 15% margins. And we like the fact that we're kind of back to that mid-teens digits and looking for opportunities for M&A to match with the business, to continue to grow the business and maybe have opportunities to enhance that margin profile through an M&A transaction.

David S. MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

Great. Congratulations on that progress. As a follow-up, I guess, I just wanted to stay close to the water treatment business and just ask for any thoughts you've got and what you're seeing in the way of consumer demand patterns and how that may be evolving and how that's influencing your guide on '26 for water treatment.

Stephen Shafer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think overall, that business is closely connected to the consumer. So there's I'd say some caution that we see from consumers. In some segments of the market, it's considered a discretionary spend item. So we're -- from that standpoint, I think there's maybe cautiousness as we enter 2026. But overall, we still see it as growth because we see the category is still growing. We still see penetration opportunities, and we still see our opportunity to build out our own dealer network and grow even beyond the market.

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Seaport Research Partners.

Scott Graham
Seaport Research Partners

I wanted to maybe get a little bit more color from you guys on maybe beyond what you provided with the initial question on this competition in distribution wholesale. And what I'm wondering is, are you kind of saying that like residential water heaters in that channel are now kind of more jump ball? Or is it that maybe some of the higher-end stuff because of the pros that, that is what is maybe under a little bit of pressure. Is it -- so in other words, if wholesale is half of residential approximately, is that entire half an area of concern now? Or is it less?

Stephen Shafer
President, CEO & Director

No, I don't think the characterization of a jump ball is what's happening. I would characterize it more of a lot of industry dynamics that have always been out there, right? And you have channel partners that are dedicated to certain brands, and we partner very closely with them to help reach and serve the contractors and trade groups well. And then there's others that carry multiple brands and there's some share shift that happens through those dynamics. I would say that those are the dynamics. They've always been in that part of the market. There's still the dynamics playing out today. What we find is oftentimes when there are movements around share, there's typically reactions to those movements and those take time to play out.

And I think where we are right now in the wholesale market, like I said, it gets a little bit more intense when the market itself is not growing because the new construction builds aren't there that the wholesale channel primarily is the mechanism that serves that part of the market. There's a little bit of pressure, as we mentioned, coming from the retail players who are really looking to make inroads with the professionals. So that intensities dial up a little bit, but the dynamics itself are not new. And I'd say they're ones that we typically know how to navigate. And we do it working closely with our customers. And like I said, as there are actions and movements that happen, there's typically reactions. And over time, those things work their way out, and that's our focus of what we're going to navigate here when we talk about the start of 2026.

Scott Graham
Seaport Research Partners

Okay. I want to maybe just ask a follow-up question on capital. And with the Leonard Valve acquisition, it's clearly more of a pivot to, Stephen, what you said about water management. And so what I'm wondering here is that with this pivot, and I know you found Leonard Valve, and that's wonderful. But for many years, the focus was on water treatment pretty much as a silo. And I'm just wondering how the pipeline is in water management with Leonard now done? Is that something that you have to build? Or have you been building a pipeline there?

Stephen Shafer
President, CEO & Director

I think it's a pipeline that's been pretty visible for us for a while. I mean I think when you're in kind of the plumbing space, you know who the players are. Like I said, there's a lot of overlap on how you go to market. There's a lot of overlap in terms of how you serve contractors. So it's not a starting from scratch kind of pipeline. I think that's been visible to us. I think the focus and attention we're putting on it is now kind of dialed up because there's a lot of different options of ways we could go. As you mentioned, we've been very focused on building out the water treatment platform. And this is a pivot that's not us walking away from water treatment. In fact, we think that's a very attractive growth platform that we're going to continue to invest in. But we do feel like there's more opportunity for us as a company.

And we love our core water heater and boiler business today. It generates great cash flow. It's very resilient. We're a market leader in that space. And we want to think about how do we leverage that to actually find more growth opportunities where we participate. That's what we're trying to do with our water management effort. I think we know who the players are out there. But as I mentioned, with any acquisition strategy, there's a lot dependent upon what's available and when. And I think we can be competitive there. We're also going to remain disciplined in our approach on how we go after it.

Our next question comes from the line of Tomohiko Sano with JPMorgan.

Ethan Coyle
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

This is Ethan on for Tomo. I wanted to ask for a little bit more color on India. It seems like the -- you guys have delivered strong growth with the Pureit integration adding incremental revenue. Can you share a little bit on the road map for scaling India over the next 3 to 5 years? And maybe any details on potentially further M&A within that area?

Stephen Shafer
President, CEO & Director

I think right now, our primary focus is on how do we take advantage of the Pureit addition to our portfolio. India is a market that we've invested there significantly to get the business up and running. And obviously, the Pureit was an additional investment to that business. We've got a local team there that really understands the local market, and we think we've got a lot of opportunities now kind of organically, if you will, with the combination of Pureit and our A.O. Smith business. It's a market that requires a lot of high-paced innovation, bringing new products out to market. That's a big driver of how we've been able to grow double digits for many years in a row. And that's -- we're now going to do at a bigger scale, as you mentioned. So that's our primary focus. Ultimately, over time, does it mean more acquisitions or not, I think that still has to play out, but our focus right now is primarily running the business we've got.

Ethan Coyle
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And looking more on the margin side for international, with India continuing to scale up, can we kind of forecast out strength within operational improvements similar to this year out into maybe 2027 or looking more on a longer-term scale with China potentially improving in the second half of this year?

Charles Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, this is Chuck. I would say a little bit more longer term scale. I mean we're still investing in growth in India. We love the fact we're growing double digits together with Pureit bringing those business together, India is still in the growth profile. China, I think it's a little early to call out much margin improvement. We're very pleased with how China performed this year in the fourth quarter and particularly the restructuring actions that we took in 2024 are paying off and the team managing through a tough top line did a very good job of managing the margin. So margin improvement in both businesses, I think, will take a little bit of time, and we'll have to see how that plays out, particularly the economy in China and as we grow scale in India and investment in growth.

Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.

Nathan Jones
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

A follow-up on steel prices. You guys said you're expecting steel prices to be up 10%. Can you just clarify what that means? Is that like average 2026 over average 2025? Or are you expecting steel prices to increase from where they are now? And then does that imply that you need to get more price in order to cover some of these inflationary pressures, along with some of the other things that you mentioned there are still inflationary pressures?

Charles Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Steel pricing has gone up, right? So we've seen kind of a gradual increase in the index, which does drive what we pay on a 90- to 120-day lag. That 10% up is the year-over-year average. I would say if you kind of box it in, it's 10%, 2026 over 2025 as well as 10% up quarter-over-quarter 2025. So we'll see steel, we project steel to still rise a bit as we go through the back half of the year, but on average, up 10% year-over-year. As far as price cost relationship, we do have carryover tariffs. We've got other costs that are going up. I'll just kind of point to kind of our historical ability to be able to, over time, kind of maintain and protect our price/cost relationship and our margin profile.

Nathan Jones
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. I guess. And then my follow-up question. The slide on Leonard Valve has 2022 to 2025 revenue CAGR of double digits, I think you said it was about 10%. There was a lot of inflation, and I assume that there's a lot of metals in a lot of their products as well. And a fair amount of that kind of growth was probably driven by price as well. Could you maybe just comment on what you think the long-term growth of that business is kind of the volume that they can generate rather than what I just assume is some price-driven growth that you've seen there over the last few years?

Stephen Shafer
President, CEO & Director

Actually, the biggest source, and Chuck mentioned, of the growth in Leonard Valve has been the digital transition of mixing valves. So it's a technology upgrade that's happening that's adding a lot of value in the marketplace. And so more so than just a pure kind of pass-through of cost pricing. That's been the big driver of the growth over the last few years. And it was one of the real appealing characteristics for us to both get more involved on that digital upgrade, but also bring that kind of capability of thinking into the broader ecosystem of solutions that we can serve our customers. So from that standpoint, we think it's a growth that has still more momentum to it.

Charles Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

And just to frame about 30% of their volume or the revenue is digital and connected products. So it's a base that we look to grow over time.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.

Andrew Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Steve, I know that the strategic review is ongoing in China, as you said, but restructuring does seem to be helping stabilize the margin in the business. So if, for instance, the market doesn't come back as you expect in the second half, do you have more restructuring that you can do? How do you think about the ability to sort of maintain margin if the market is still difficult?

Stephen Shafer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean look, over long periods of time, right, the answer in China is not continuing to restructure and cut costs and not be able to grow the business. So we're doing what we think is necessary to protect the business today, and we're making, I think, smart decisions around where we do cut. There's a lot still to play out in terms of how the market will kind of respond, especially as we start to lap these subsidies. So we're watching that carefully. Obviously, the strategic assessment we're doing might change kind of how we approach our business in China. That's the high-quality discussions that we're having with partners.

Whether there's more structuring in the future, I think we'll evaluate that as we go. I think ultimately, though, our goal is we need to find a way for the business to be even more competitive than it has been going forward. And eventually, the market will recover. But when that is, I think, is still obviously a big uncertainty. But we'll do what we need to do to make sure we can maintain the competitiveness of the business there financially. But ultimately, we need to find a strategic path forward that allows the business to grow again.

Andrew Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. And then your boiler business has continued to be pretty solid, and I think you have a good forecast for '26. So maybe just a little more color on the health of that market? I know your high-efficiency boilers are doing well, but is that mostly what this is? Or is it the market strength overall?

Stephen Shafer
President, CEO & Director

It's good market, but I would say our Lochinvar brand, and it is the, I think, premier brand in that marketplace. We have great technology, as we've talked about, on the high efficiency end, it's a great product. So it's a little bit of both. It's been a strong market, but also I think we're performing well and even taking share in that market with the strength of our product portfolio.
