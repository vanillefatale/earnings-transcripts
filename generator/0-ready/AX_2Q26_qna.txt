[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Chiaverini with Jefferies.

David Chiaverini
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

So I wanted to start with the net interest margin outlook. I think I heard you right that the normalized level was 4.72% and that you expect a 6 basis point decline. So that would imply 4.66%. Just wanted to confirm that I heard that right was the first part. And then could you also talk about how much the average remaining life of the FDIC purchase loans?

Gregory Garrabrants
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So with respect to the first question on net interest margin, that's correct. I do think because we've had so much robust loan demand, as I said, that I've been able to kind of push up average spreads a little bit. But I think a good conservative approach would be to assume that you're going to have that 5 to 6 basis point decline in the adjusted margin just based on the robust growth we had. We did well on the deposit side, but we did, I think, pretty well on the down beta, but that's where that is. And then with respect to the Signature side, it's almost -- it's like 3 or 4 more years, right?

Derrick Walsh
Executive VP & CFO

Correct, yes.

Gregory Garrabrants
President, CEO & Director

About 3 or 4 more years. So that's 6.5%. It's relatively steady, right? It's a little more -- it's because of just the way the accounting is. So obviously, we could have -- either theoretically, you could have a loss in the portfolio, which we haven't had yet, but you could or you could have a prepayment, which would then accelerate that and then we would describe what the otherwise then new level of accretion would be per quarter.

David Chiaverini
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. And in terms of -- you alluded to potential team lift-outs. Can you talk about a pipeline there and what you're seeing?

Gregory Garrabrants
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think we've done a decent number of team lift-outs. And in a lot of cases, those teams are now adding people where they see opportunities on a more individual basis. So although we clearly -- we look for -- we look at acquisitions, we look at teams, I think we've really done a lot there in the last year, the floor plan team, the tech team, some other geographic teams. And so I think we're probably more likely now in the coming quarter to be a little more focused on developing -- or the coming quarters, a little more focused on developing those teams, adding where necessary. So we've kind of made those investments, and we want to see them kind of come to fruition and get a little more mature.

David Chiaverini
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. And then last one for me is just on the portfolio acquisition front. Similar question. Is there much of a pipeline there? Or are you seeing many portfolios for sale?

Gregory Garrabrants
President, CEO & Director

On the loan side, we have such robust organic growth through our own channels and that we'll see small ones, but I don't really think that's going to be a massive part. I haven't really seen a lot of those. And when they are, they come up, they're sort of a bunch of low-rate multifamily loans where people are trying to pretend that they're not as marked as they should be or whatever. But there's always interesting deals. I mean we're across the spectrum going on, and we are always spending our time thinking about those and making sure we're in the deal flow.

Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham & Company.

Kyle Peterson
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to start off on the growth outlook. Great to hear the commentary and good to see the balances and the pipelines both looking really good. But in terms of moving forward to kind of support that low to mid-teens outlook here, should we expect more of the same, some of the strength, whether it's CRE specialty, warehouse, leasing and some of these other things. Is it more of the same? Or are there other parts that you are thinking will become more attractive or you see additional opportunities in the next couple of quarters here?

Gregory Garrabrants
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think that, obviously, CRESL was heavy growth this quarter. We don't expect that -- we expect it to be a little more balanced next quarter. Fund finance continues to do well. We expect non-real estate lender finance, maybe to have a little bit better quarter, floor plan will start to kick in. So yes, I think it's going to be pretty balanced. And I think Verdant is -- they're a bit of a seasonal business. They tend to have a bigger fourth quarter and first quarter is slower. It's just the way that leasing business is.

But we still expect that they're going to be $150 million, $200 million of growth, including all their segments, at least that's what their current projection is. So I think it's going to be pretty balanced. I feel really good about the balance we have across the groups now.

Kyle Peterson
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. That's really helpful. And then as a follow-up, I wanted to touch on fee income. I know there's some pieces moving around with Verdant. I think there's some seasonality from some paper statements and stuff. But I guess stripping out that seasonality from that, is this a good run rate moving forward for fee income with Verdant in the fold? Obviously, I know there can be some moving on rates, but in a more stable rate environment, would this quarter be a good jumping off point?

Derrick Walsh
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think that's right, Kyle. I think the -- we did have the paper statement fee. That was about $1.5 million this past quarter. So impactful, but not overly impactful by any means. And -- but that's the Verdant income. We expect to be generally consistent through that noninterest income line item and maybe some small growth there as they grow originations. But it's only about 20% or even a little shy of that of their portfolio.

So that come through in operating leases. And there's nuances to that with the accounting and as far as the classification as to what hits operating and what hits the net interest income line item. But I think this is a good jumping off point.

Kyle Peterson
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Have a nice quarter, guys.

Gregory Garrabrants
President, CEO & Director

Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of David Feaster with Raymond James.

David Feaster
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Greg, I got a high-level one for you. I mean you guys have more going on than any other bank that I know. I mean you've got a ton of growth engines. You've got a lot of irons in the fire, if you will, that you're developing, businesses that you're incubating. Like from your standpoint, what are you most excited about today that you're working on that you think can be maybe most impactful to the business?

Gregory Garrabrants
President, CEO & Director

Yes, it's an interesting question. I mean I'll dodge it, then I'll answer it. I think one of the reasons that we have continued to do as well as we have for as long as we have is that we do have that balance. And so that balance allows us to have strong growth, but not actually have a rushed growth in anything. So if you really look at the underlying businesses, any one of those businesses isn't growing at a crazy speed usually, but the combination of all of those businesses together end up generating a reasonable level of growth.

So in a lot of respects, a lot of the infrastructure that's necessary for those businesses to succeed and to grow and to get operating leverage really rely on a common data infrastructure, common sales force platform that allows us to track what's going on with our teams and all those kind of things. So there's a balance that's been created intentionally as a result of that diversity.

That being said, I think where I'm really excited is that I've always felt like we've had so many better ideas technologically than we were able to fund and that a lot of our fintech competitors because of the nature of how they were able to run money-losing operations for such long periods of time and were measured by clicks or eyeballs when we would be measured by, oh my gosh, $0.01 here and $0.01 there, right? And then now with what I'm seeing with the platforms, just with respect to AI and code development, I really do see a bending of that cost curve with respect to our ability to do a lot more development.

So the ability to be able to rapidly respond to customer needs through really staying close to the customer from a platform perspective and then being able to react in more real time to those needs on those platforms, I think is going to be really impactful. And it's not -- it's -- I can feel and taste it in a way that I haven't been able to just based on what I see the speed of some of the things that we're able to do in the new AI software development life cycle.

So I think that's what will be the biggest change and the most exciting change because then you really can innovate in interesting and unique ways, and that's something that really a lot of that innovation has not been limited by our ideas, but it's more been limited by just kind of attempting to balance all the different cost structure factors with the other growth in the businesses.

David Feaster
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. I also want to touch on the expansion in CRESL this quarter. Obviously, growth was massive. You alluded to don't run rate this level of growth this next quarter. Can you just touch on what changed to drive that? Like was this just a lot of demand? Did payoffs and paydowns slow? Or did you move upstream a bit and have a few larger deals? I'm just kind of curious if you could talk about what drove the strength?

Gregory Garrabrants
President, CEO & Director

There was -- the paydown issue was significant. And what had really happened there is we're still -- if you think about these deals as 3-year kind of average lives, there was still -- we had just done some kind of pulling back in certain areas around that time. And so there was some gaps and you could see it and you could kind of predict the enhanced prepays, right?

And so if you think about those COVID time frames, think about the length of the deals, there was just time frames where we were -- where we just weren't sure where things were going and we were more cautious, but then you just ended up having little prepay bulges throughout there. So that's one. And then sometimes it just happens. There were some deals that got pushed in different quarters and some went early and it ended up being larger than it was. I don't know, Derrick, if you have anything you want to mention.

Derrick Walsh
Executive VP & CFO

No, I think, yes, the repayments -- the headwind that we had talked about for the last year slowing is basically the one word answer to repayments.

Gregory Garrabrants
President, CEO & Director

Yes, yes.

David Feaster
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's great. And then, look, when you've got that kind of growth, I mean, funding it is not easy. And so your ability to fund loan growth has been really impressive. It looks like it was primarily within specialty deposits and commercial, where you were able to drive a lot of deposit growth. Could you touch on maybe like within those segments, where are you seeing the most opportunity and where you're having the most success driving that growth?

Gregory Garrabrants
President, CEO & Director

Sure. We did have a good deposit growth quarter, and we were a little sensitive about being maybe as aggressive with the rate reductions that we would normally drive because we've been driving not only to 100% beta, but to an actual neutral NII, and we were able to achieve that pretty much on every rate decline to date.

And I think we did a pretty good job here on that side, too, but I did advise on that. I think that when we look forward, a 700, 800, even maybe a little bit more growth number, that number feels good for us from what the organic side looks like. And that probably comes 60-ish percent from consumer and then the rest of it from the commercial and security side with really balance across a lot of different areas. Everything from HOA and title and escrow and just regular operating deposits and all those things, they're all contributing, and those are continuing to allow us to grow.

So I mean, frankly, dealing with down rate environments, when you're doing as aggressive deposit repricing as we are with respect to prior neutralization of NII differences and then 100% plus betas that are associated with that, that does make growth a little harder. But I think having a little bit of stability there, even if it's for a few quarters, will be helpful. I don't think it's absolutely necessary. We could still handle rate declines, but that will be helpful. And obviously, loan growth this quarter was above what we expect to achieve. We've given numbers that it's going to be half that roughly or something around that. So that obviously is much more in line with what our organic capabilities are on the funding side.

Our next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson.

Gary Tenner
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

I just wanted to ask a follow-up on the Verdant impact on the fees and expenses. It sounds like the addition on the fee side, was there a greater percentage of their existing assets that were classified as operating leases than maybe expected that drove that larger fee component this quarter?

Derrick Walsh
Executive VP & CFO

I don't think so. I think we had referenced -- we had the $200 million -- a little over $200 million that we classified as operating leases last quarter. I think the -- if reflecting back what we might have done was given a net kind of impact of the impact between the depreciation and the fee income and not the gross impact. And so I probably could have done a better job breaking that gross impact in those line items out for everyone. So that might -- I'm not sure if that's what you're referring to, Gary.

Gary Tenner
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Yes. Yes, that might be it, Derrick. So then as we're -- I know you gave kind of the expectation that you're kind of looking to hold expense growth to about 30% of revenue growth. But as we're thinking about the interplay Verdant specifically between the fee and expense side, that pace of depreciation and amortization growth relative to the pace of fee growth, what would be -- is there a rule of thumb to be thinking about on how those move together?

Derrick Walsh
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And just to clarify that, the 30% refers to the salaries and related costs and professional services combined. So those 2 segments of the noninterest expenses. So that's where that doesn't incorporate the depreciation aspect. But the depreciation will be relatively consistent as we look forward here, maybe a small amount of growth just from new assets that are originated and that will align generally with increases as well on the fee income side. But that the run rate of that depreciation line item, this is kind of that new run rate for it.

Gary Tenner
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then just one other expense question, Derrick. You mentioned a $7 million increase to G&A. What was that related to? I missed the comment there.

Derrick Walsh
Executive VP & CFO

That was related to the -- we have subordinated loans that we made a claim on back to the Clearing matter about 7 years ago. And our claim on that was denied. And so that's where the additional $7 million is our estimate of expense that we expect to incur as a relation to that.

Gregory Garrabrants
President, CEO & Director

And that's a onetime item that was related back to that issue we had all those years ago.

Gary Tenner
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Okay. Great. I appreciate the color there. And then, Greg, just in terms of the Qualia partnership that you announced a short while ago, can you kind of characterize the opportunity that you see through that partnership?

Gregory Garrabrants
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think it's significant. They've been a really great partner. We've been exploring just different ways to work together. They're a very innovative financial technology company. And so they obviously are a leader in the escrow space, which helps us. And they have a financial technology that's utilized by a significant part of the escrow industry. And so we have a couple of territories that are exclusive right now to that, and I'm not going to get too much into that. But I think it will be helpful on the deposit side, and that's an interesting specialty deposit vertical, and they're quite an innovative company, and we've got some ideas of stuff to do with them.

Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Motta with KBW.

Kelly Motta
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Maybe circling back to the loan growth guidance. I appreciate that this is particularly strong and to not run rate this CRESL's strength. But with your low mid-teens guidance reiterated, I just wanted to clarify, is that -- I think that was supposed to be for the balance of the year ex Verdant off of this very high level of growth in your second quarter. Does your guidance imply a slowdown in the second half? It seems like pipelines are strong. So just trying to square that.

Gregory Garrabrants
President, CEO & Director

Yes. No, that's -- I understand where you're going with that. I mean I think we also said just trying to be a little more clarity. We think it's around $600 million to $800 million this quarter. Could it be a little higher? Yes, I think lower is unlikely, but that would be not a bad number range. And I don't really think we think that's going to change in the next quarter after that. But it's always hard to have visibility out that far. But I mean, I think we feel pretty good about that. And that does include Verdant, and it also includes me being able to be a little bit tougher on lower rate deals, which is a potential, but I think it's a difficult upside to quantify and maybe one that doesn't materialize with respect to margin.

So I wouldn't put it in the numbers, but it's potentially there. Because frankly, I mean, this is more about where we want to grow from a capital perspective, where we want to grow from a liquidity perspective. And so all that comes together. And I think that 800-ish kind of range, a little lower, a little more is around where we think we can be.

Kelly Motta
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's really helpful. It seems like Verdant has been a really nice home run with those folks producing really well. And you touched on some of the synergies you expect from there. I mean, would you expect their pace of growth to kind of continue at the strength that's been here? Just maybe talking a bit more about the flexibility of their balance sheet has enabled them to be more active or if there's kind of a pull-through of that pipeline?

Gregory Garrabrants
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thank you, Kelly. Yes, well, so I do believe that for some of their clients, really great clients they have, I mean, some big corporations and folks that have really great credit profiles, big municipalities, things like that, they were very limited with respect to their ability to serve those clients at the capacity that they have the capability of doing. And so we do add that.

It is a little bit of a cyclical business just from a standpoint that the fourth quarter tends to be a little heavier. And in general, I think that sentiment is right. The teams are getting along extremely well. They're a good cultural fit. I think they see the benefit of being here and integrating with the team, not only are they getting more tech support and help, but they were able to become immediately profitable based on the refinancing of their subordinated debt and of their lines of credit, which were from JPMorgan and other big banks. So -- and to get deposit funding is obviously really helpful.

So yes, and then I think also -- I mean, frankly, I did not expect this. They've been enthusiastically selling deposits, and that's actually been working, which I'm kind of surprised by, which is cool. I thought that -- but I think they're not only going full bore first, but it helps to add it to the comp plan, I guess. And then, yes, then I think that, obviously, the floor plan business, they've introduced some floor plan transactions because I mean, they've got a lot of salespeople out there talking to a lot of dealers, and those dealers also have floor plan needs.

So that's really beginning. We've got a couple of referrals there, but I do think that, that ability to think about that technologically over time can result in some interesting synergies because obviously, they're part of the same ecosystem on the supply chain side with what's being housed on a floor plan line is eventually sold to a client that could be financed through Verdant. So I think that's an interesting. Exactly how that works and how we bring that together, we're working through. But it is -- I think it's -- there are a couple of cool synergistic businesses there.
