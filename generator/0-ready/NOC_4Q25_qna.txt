[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ronald Epstein with Bank of America.

Ronald Epstein
BofA Securities, Research Division

Kathy, if we could just pick up on your remarks -- in your prepared remarks on transforming Northrop Grumman. I mean how are you broadly thinking about our company with the breadth and depth and legacy of Northrop Grumman and how that jives with this push towards the nontraditionals? I mean you pointed out a couple of the CCA programs and unmanned stuff that you've done. But I mean kind of strategically broadly, how are you thinking about it? Because it seems like you all are doing quite well at it. But just if we could maybe -- however the cliche is double click on that or peel back the onion on that.

Kathy Warden
Chair, CEO & President

Yes. Thanks, Ron, for the question. As you said, we have been transforming the way we are meeting our customers' needs. I talked about it somewhat in my prepared remarks how our strategy for technology leadership has not changed, but we are directing that talented engineering and operations team to be able to design products that can be fielded more quickly. We're balancing the need for performance with affordability and speed to market. And so we believe that we have all of the foundation to meet this moment, but we are directing that talent in ways that are more applicable to what this administration has a strong sense of urgency to do, which is field capability quickly.

And I'd also say that we have been investing. This is not something we've just started doing this year. As you know, we've been investing in our business to build capacity and capacity is critical to fielding capability quickly. And we have that capacity ready to go in many areas. I talked about solid rocket motors and how we have already doubled capacity, and we'll have tripled by early next year. I talked about the work that we are doing in space where we've gone from producing tens of satellites a year to hundreds. And we are also obviously looking to accelerate programs like B-21. And so across this entire portfolio, we have the opportunity to lean in to moving faster and we're organizing ourselves to be able to do that.

Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.

Sheila Kahyaoglu
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Kathy, maybe expanding on the Ron's question a little bit in your answer. The fiscal '27 budget provides a lot of money out there to be contracted and as you think about your '26 plan and thinking about the longer-term trajectory of growth, where do you see the biggest opportunities for acceleration? And how do you balance that with some of the investments that you need for that capacity?

Kathy Warden
Chair, CEO & President

Yes. Thank you, Sheila. We are absolutely taking a balanced approach to what we have incorporated into our guidance and what we still see as opportunity ahead. So what is incorporated into our guidance is where we see clear funding and where we have accumulated backlog or we have a high expectation of award. There are a few areas that we've specifically called out, like B-21 and Apex, where we have not incorporated that yet into our guidance. F/A-XX is the name that we use for Apex. So that is really how we are thinking about our 2026 guidance. There is a good bit of opportunity out there for our team to go capture in this opportunity-rich environment, but we have incorporated into our guidance what we clearly believe is headed toward contract or already in our backlog.

Sheila Kahyaoglu
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Got it. So maybe my follow-up is, as we think about '26 growth in the mid-single-digit range, does it accelerate from there in '27 as we think about international coupled onto that?

Kathy Warden
Chair, CEO & President

We believe that it does based on what signals we are receiving regarding the FY '27 U.S. budget and the fact that we see continued acceleration of demand internationally. I spoke to a few of the areas of growth that we expect to see. We believe we will have a book-to-bill internationally well above 1 again this year, and that positions us for growth into 2027.

Operator

Our next question comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley.

Kristine Liwag
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Maybe, Kathy, going back into the 2026 revenue outlook. Backlog is at a new record at $96 billion as you called out. And the midpoint of your outlook provides 4% year-over-year growth. Can you talk about what's driving the significant conservatism in your outlook? What are the key variables that convert more of this backlog into revenue? And can you size the B-21 and F/A-XX, that's not in your guidance if those contracts were to firm up, how could that change your '26 outlook?

Kathy Warden
Chair, CEO & President

So Kristine, you call it conservatism, I'll call it a balanced approach. It's a dynamic environment. And so as we look at 2026, we believe we have invested in the areas that will see significant growth in the coming years. Munitions, which I spoke to with our solid rocket motor capacity, golden Dome and its associated opportunities for homeland defense, the F/A-XX program our collaborative combat aircraft offerings. Yet as we sit here in January, we have not yet seen those opportunities progress toward contract. And we believe that will happen over the next 24 months, the timing of that is what is much more difficult to predict as we sit here. And so in terms of translating into 2026 sales upside, we believe there is opportunity there, but difficult to put our finger on. As we look to 2027, we feel much more confident that those opportunities will lead to increasing sales. And we're taking the long view as we always have, both in how we think about investment, but also the long-term growth trajectory of the enterprise.

Operator

Our next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank.

Scott Deuschle
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

John or Ken, you got a big award on GEM 63 here in the quarter, but I believe in your prepared remarks, you called for flat volumes on that program. So can you just clarify why the volumes are flat on GEM 63 in light of that award? And should we expect growth there to reaccelerate in 2027?

Kenneth Crews

Yes. As you know -- Scott, this is Ken. Historically, this is an area where we've been investing in capacity. And so when we think about 2026, it will be flat year-over-year as we continue to expand that capacity. To your point, in 2027, we do expect GEM 63 to continue to grow. And over the long term, it will continue to be one of the growth drivers for our Space Systems segment on top of other activities, including the restricted space security.

Scott Deuschle
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And then, Kathy, sorry if I missed this, but if the B-21 acceleration of work hits in the quarter, should we think about that as being potentially additive to 2026 EBIT dollars? Or is it more of a wash in 2026?

Kathy Warden
Chair, CEO & President

So as we sit here today, we are still working through the finer points of that deal and its financial implications for the company. We do expect to invest $2 billion to $3 billion over a multiyear period. We do expect to have a better opportunity for returns on the program, again, over a multiyear period and we do expect accelerated revenue as a result, again, ramping over a multiyear period. So you won't see a tremendous amount of impact in 2026. The greater impact of all of those components that I just outlined will happen '27, '28 and somewhat into '29. So hopefully, that gives you a better sense for modeling.

Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.

Robert Stallard
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

If I'm correct, I don't think your prepared comments had any mention whatsoever of dividends or buybacks. I was wondering if you could give us an update on what your thoughts are there, particularly given recent commentary from the U.S. government?

John Greene
Corporate VP & CFO

Yes, I'll be happy to take that. So when the team built out the plan, we took a look at our capital allocation strategy and what we're seeing and what the team saw was robust opportunity to deliver future earnings through investment. So we made a decision to keep the share count flat and increase our spending on property, plant and equipment in order to build out the industrial base similar to what I commented in my prepared remarks. So the plan at this point is not to execute on additional buybacks beyond the end of this month, January. And the dividend plan will be agreed with the Board in the May time frame. So we expect associated with the second quarter earnings that we'll have an update on that.

Robert Stallard
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Okay. And then a quick follow-up actually links into that. In terms of the growth going forward, how much of this is dependent on the supply chain? Are they pacing item here? And do you expect Northrop Grumman to have to invest its own money in the supply chain?

Kathy Warden
Chair, CEO & President

So as I mentioned, we are already partnering with our supply chain. As we look at capacity expansion, we do detailed operations planning with our supply chain. And in most cases, they are investing alongside of us. We do see areas that we work with the federal government that need to be shored up not just for our contracts, but more broadly, this tends to be at lower levels of the supply chain areas like raw materials including rare earth. And in those cases, the government often is directly engaging with those participants in the supply chain to address any shortages that we see. But most of the activity is through us and our direct work with our supply chain.

Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.

Seth Seifman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just wanted to maybe clarify on that last question. I mean I think the assumption is that Northrop will continue to be paying dividends, I assume, right?

John Greene
Corporate VP & CFO

Yes. 100%.

Kathy Warden
Chair, CEO & President

Yes. We're simply talking about the May time frame is when our Board looks at our annual increase in the dividend, and so it would be premature to speculate on that.

Seth Seifman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then with regard to the remainder of the cash, I guess, if we -- let's say, $3.3 billion or so of cash and then we think about dividends. And so probably left with about $2 billion, and I think you talked about repaying $0.5 billion of debt, well over $4 billion on the balance sheet. Do you anticipate holding more cash on the balance sheet? Do you anticipate that there might be opportunities that emerge within the year or shortly after that would require significantly more near-term capital investments? Or what would happen to the balance of this year's cash flow?

John Greene
Corporate VP & CFO

Yes. Yes, Seth, why don't I try to hit it, and then I'll get some support from Kathy. So in terms of the overall cash position of the company, we're in a situation where we see great opportunity to invest. So I mentioned the increase in the capital deployment, certainly some cash will be allocated to that. We also -- as we look at our day-to-day cash position, I think there's an opportunity to maybe scale that up slightly given the growth of the business over the past 4 or 5 years. So we'll be looking at that. And then in the debt stack, there's some at least one note that the coupon is over 7%. So we'll take a look at the analysis around that. And see if it makes sense to deploy some cash that way. But the great thing is to summarize is the cash conversion cycle of the business is outstanding, and we'll have an opportunity to make smart decisions in terms of how we're going to deploy cash and make sure we're efficient with it.

Operator

Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons with UBS.

Gavin Parsons
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

It looks like you're absorbing higher CapEx in your free cash flow guidance this year, but do you still have line of sight to $4 billion in 2028?

Kathy Warden
Chair, CEO & President

So Gavin, it's a little early to project 2028 at this point based on the set of opportunities that I mentioned earlier. So with B-21, if we are afforded the opportunity to accelerate that program, it will be good for our shareholders in terms of long-term revenue profile and earnings, but we will need to invest more in facilitizing for that acceleration. We also have a number of opportunities, and I shared some of those that pending award, we want to be in a position to have cash on hand to invest more in supporting those because, again, they're well aligned with the administration's priorities in homeland defense, crewed fighters and uncrewed vehicles to name just a few.

And so as we look at those sets of opportunities likely being determined later this year into early 2027, that will really set our CapEx profile and any increased sales and earnings that we would expect to achieve as a result of those opportunities flowing into the plan. So I would just simply tell you our capital deployment strategy has not changed, the discipline around where we choose to invest has not changed. And as we factor those new opportunities in, we'll update '27 and '28 accordingly.

Gavin Parsons
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. Appreciate it. And do you mind clarifying the B-21 investment comment you made, the $2 billion to $3 billion, is that before or after an acceleration?

Kathy Warden
Chair, CEO & President

That is for the acceleration. So that's only if we agree to an acceleration, and it is over a multiyear period of time. So that's why I outlined for you. That would be our expectation for total investment to get to the accelerated rates.

Operator

Our next question comes from John Godyn with Citi.

John Godyn
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I wanted to revisit the quarterly cadence and inorganic growth. I think I heard you say that it was going to accelerate throughout the year. That's on the back of a very big 4Q number, 10% organic growth. And I wanted to just square that up a bit and explore the possibility of maybe a stronger start to the year than a sharp decel because it seems like you've got a lot of momentum exiting the year.

Kathy Warden
Chair, CEO & President

We did have a lot of momentum exiting the year. There are a few factors that are contributing to that profile that we talked about, which will look similar to what we experienced in 2025. One is we did have a very strong Q4. And part of that was material timing and delivery, which naturally will not reoccur in the first quarter. The second and probably most material is at the enterprise level, we have 61 working days in the first quarter. That is a very low profile. Typically, our quarters have 62, 63 or even 64 days. This year, that profile climbs. Usually Q4 is our least number of working days, this year it's Q1, and then we recover that in Q4. So those two things are primarily the driver for the profile this year, and we expect still to have a good growth quarter in the first quarter, just not as strong as what we expect to have later in the year.

John Godyn
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

That's really helpful. And if we just kind of think through that throughout the year, at the end of '26, you guys will be putting up the largest organic growth on the 10% comp this year. So the 2 year-over-year rate going to be quite dramatic. You've talked about positivity into '27, but it seems like you'd be exiting '26 with a lot of momentum and maybe the step up there could be quite significant. Is that the way to think about it at a high level?

Kathy Warden
Chair, CEO & President

It absolutely is. The backlog growth that I talked about in 2025 that takes time to ramp as we progress through the year in 2026, particularly our space business that had a very strong book-to-bill last year. Now we expect to see in the second half of 2026, those opportunities really ramp top line and carry that momentum into '27, but that is true across the portfolio.

Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research.

Myles Walton
Wolfe Research, LLC

I was curious, was there any net effect in the shutdown on the numbers, whether in the P&L or in the cash flow statement in the fourth quarter? And then, Kathy, bigger picture, if suspending this belief that the defense budget did climb 50%, that kind of seismic shift would suggest maybe a seismic shift in a company strategy as well, perhaps. And so what, if anything, would you kind of revisit if you did have that level of step function in terms of positioning the portfolio, investing in the portfolio? And maybe just communicating what investors should be looking at period?

Kenneth Crews

Myles, I'll answer the first part of that, and then I'll turn it over to Kathy. In terms of impact from shut down, no major impact from shutdown and that was reflected just due to the strong year-over-year growth in us exceeding the top end of our guidance range on sales, but then also the $3.3 billion of cash in Q4, creating that 26%. So overall, to the first part of your question, no material impact to 2025 based on the shutdown.

Kathy Warden
Chair, CEO & President

And Myles, to answer the second part of your question, we are already thinking about this accelerated growth environment, certainly, $1.5 trillion defense budget would be a significant acceleration in national security spending, one unlike any we've seen before. But the things that we are doing as a company to prepare ourselves, moving with speed, building capacity, preserving cash to ensure we can continue to deploy it back into the business to support this unprecedented growth opportunity, both in the U.S. and abroad, happening simultaneously, which is the most robust demand environment I've seen in my career. So it does have us thinking very differently, as I outlined both in my prepared remarks and in answer to Ron's question about how we're transforming the company.

This organization is well positioned because we have been working towards this moment for years. But at the same time, there is more for us to do, and we are focused on our engineering and operations talent helping to design the right solutions so that we can be competitive. We are focused on performing against all of our commitments to earn the right to win new business and then, of course, positioning ourselves with the capacity to deliver and to put that capacity to work.

Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC.

Kenneth Herbert
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Kathy, maybe just -- can you talk about what the guidance implies for international growth in 2026? And specifically, you've called out a number of quarters now, it seems like an accelerating opportunity for IBCS in particular. When could we maybe expect to see some contract announcements of that beyond, obviously, the customers you've already talked about?

Kathy Warden
Chair, CEO & President

Yes. So for international, we expect 2026 to be a particularly strong year in awards setting us up for 2027. As I noted in my prepared remarks about IBCS, we do have 20 countries that have expressed interest. We expect the U.S. and Poland to continue to expand deployments this year. And then we have another two or three that we expect to announce awards this year and then others to follow out of that pipeline of 20. What I will also say, though, is our international sales growth is widespread. .

So munitions is another area where we see significant growth in double digit and we expect that to continue. I noticed some airborne radar programs that we anticipate awards on this year. We won't see so much sales impacts in '26 from those. The awards will come this year and then sales more in '27. And we also see just our base business continue to ramp in international content. So as we look at E-2D and Triton, we have international opportunities in the pipeline that will feed those production lines as well.

Our next question comes from Richard Safran with Seaport Research Partners.

Richard Safran
Seaport Research Partners

I just have one two-part question on backlog, if I might. Could you discuss the quarter-over-quarter changes in backlog at Space, which I think is roughly up about $2.3 billion. Kathy, was that all from the constellation you mentioned in your opening remarks or was there anything else? Second part, and just to get specific on your remarks, given the strong bookings for the company in '25, book-to-bill of about 1.17x, should the expectation be better than 1.17x for 2026, given your backlog growth comments and what you've been saying this morning?

Kenneth Crews

So this is Ken. I'll take that question. The drivers of space backlog was threefold, really fourfold. It was -- we were able to secure the award for GEM 63, which is Amazon Project Leo which will take deliveries well into the 2030s. We were also successful from a competitive award on T3 track with the additional 18 satellites. We secured another launch for CRS and then we had significant growth in awards for -- on our restricted portfolio. And again, as you mentioned, very strong backlog, and that's two quarters in a row for space where they've been at 1.8x sales or greater, which positions us well for the long term. When we think about 2026, given the strong backlog and the fact that we have some large significant programs with existing backlog, you should anticipate that book-to-bill around 1x sales for 2026.

Operator

Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen.

Gautam Khanna
TD Cowen, Research Division

Congratulations, Ken. I wanted to just ask about your perspectives on LHX entered into this transaction with their missile portfolio and the government. You guys obviously have Orbital ATK. Does that transaction with LHX disadvantage Northrop in any way? And are there opportunities that you see within the portfolio for a similar type of government-led investment?

Kathy Warden
Chair, CEO & President

So we have been investing in our solid rocket motor capacity and we feel we are well positioned with the capacity that we've brought online to deliver on both our commitment and additional second source initiatives that the government has asked us be involved in. So we are funding that capacity investment. We're not in discussions with the government about an arrangement similar to what they've entered into with L3Harris. And I would say that as we think about being positioned to compete, it's all about the munitions that you can support with your capacity. We feel good about that. It's about your performance. We feel good about that. And it's about your commitment to continue to invest, and we have shown that we will do that. So we feel well positioned to compete for what is a very broad set of opportunities in this space. I think there's room for growth for many companies.

Our next question comes from Douglas Harned with Bernstein.

Douglas Harned
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

On Sentinel, so the Senate Armed Services Committee has talked about now a IOC sort of at the end of 2033. This has continued to push out, and I know a lot of this is related to Air Force infrastructure. But can you talk about how we should look at the trajectory for Sentinel revenues and then also ultimately margins since it has to affect the timing you're going from development into more fixed price work?

Kathy Warden
Chair, CEO & President

So Doug, as I've noted, we are in the middle of supporting the U.S. Air Force as they restructure the Sentinel program. And coming out of that, they will firm a schedule that both locks in new time ranges for Milestone B, initial operating capability, final operating capability. And so I don't want to get ahead of the Air Force in talking about that. But certainly, as I have shared and the Air Force has as well, we are working to accelerate the time lines that were published coming out of the Nunn-McCurdy breach 2 years ago. So that is the goal, and we're making good progress to identifying options to do so.

We still believe that the program will be in development for several years and not transitioning into production until later in the decade. And that production will very much be guided by the milestone achievement during development. So that has not changed from what we've been talking about. It doesn't really impact our guidance or outlook because our outlooks only go out a few years. And so we believe that, that transition to production is outside of that 2- to 3-year window at this point.

Douglas Harned
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then on Aeronautics. The margin guidance, the low to mid-single-digit guidance for this year was a little lower than I think many of us expected. And I know you talked about there being mix more development work. But when you think of the outlook for Aeronautics margins, I guess, first, what are the -- can you talk about the development work that is sort of weighing on that margin a little bit in the near term? And then should we still see the path to 10% margins in Aeronautics over the next few years?

Kenneth Crews

So Doug, this is Ken. I'll take that question. When you look at the margin rate that we guided to for 2026, it's really driven by two factors. The first one is what's creating the growth for AS in 2026. It's B-21 where we -- you know the margin profile on that we're at 0%. And then it's also driven by development programs like TACAMO. Our mature production activities with the higher rates are relatively stable and flat when you think about F-35 and E-2D. So that is creating more of the growth is driven by those development programs, driving that rate to the low to mid 9%.

When we think about long term is absolutely as we have the opportunities to exit the LRIP activities on B-21 and as these other development programs shift to production, we do see AS being able to continue to create accretive margins and get back to that 10%, again over the long term.

Todd Ernst
Vice President, Investor Relations

All right, Josh, we're going to have to leave it there, and I'll turn it back over to Kathy for closing comments.

Kathy Warden
Chair, CEO & President

Great, Todd. So thanks. In closing, I just want to summarize that I am optimistic about the positioning of our company as we experience the significant growth in global demand. This team is committed to meeting the needs of our customers for robust and scalable solutions that can be deployed rapidly and provide the strategic deterrence and decisive advantage they need. And we're equally committed to turning those opportunities into value creation for our shareholders. So thank you again for joining us on the call today. I also want to thank Ken as this is his last call with us, and the entire Northrop Grumman team for their service to the nation. Thanks, and have a good day.
