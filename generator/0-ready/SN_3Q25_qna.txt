[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs.

Brooke Roach
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Mark, can you speak to your outlook for category growth for holiday and into 2026? How confident are you in your ability to continue to outperform the category to the same degree into next year? And is your portfolio of new innovation robust enough to cycle your own tough comparisons and continue to deliver a double-digit level of U.S. growth into 2026?

Mark Adam Barrocas
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks so much, Brooke, for the question. I guess I'll start with your second question first on new innovation. The pipeline of new innovation that we have coming out, I think, is great. You can just see what we've done over the last couple of weeks now. I mean our consumer problem-solving machine was on full display. I mean we reinvented outdoor heating and fire pit. We solved the problem of stainxiety with our cordless StainForce. We brought an at-home facial solution that extracts, moisturizes and de-puffs your skin. I'm not sure that there's another company solving all of these different types of problems.

So I think we've got a great road map of innovation. What I think I'm also really excited about, Brooke, is things that we're doing like, for example, with the BlendBOSS, we're reinventing existing categories. I think what we've done with Crispi Pro, look at how we're not resting on our laurels with the air fryer category, but we're trying to completely actually reinvent the air fryer category with Crispi and now Crispi Pro. So the innovation is coming not just from new categories and kind of home run new ideas, but it's coming from reinventing the base. And I think as we go into '26, I think we're going to see an increasingly larger amount of new products coming from reinventing the base.

On your first question in terms of category growth, I mean, look, I think we've consistently outperformed the market now for the 10 quarters that we've been a U.S. public company. I believe the innovation cycle is there. I think we're getting better and better at our content creation that we're developing. We're engaging with consumers more. So I'm excited about where things are headed.

Your next question comes from Randy Konik with Jefferies.

Randal Konik
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Just wanted to kind of go through -- Adam, first and foremost, congratulations on your new role. In terms of -- if I think about the new design center opening up in the last week or so, Mark, can you talk about what are your hopes in terms of utilizing that design center to kind of continue to build more muscle into the organization, build more innovation, where do you see that kind of fitting into the rest of the infrastructure you've built around the world? Kind of let's start there.

Mark Adam Barrocas
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Randy, I think I would start with going back to 2014 when we opened up our engineering office in Central London and recognized that there was a talent base in London for design engineering that we just couldn't attract in Boston to the degree that we wanted to at the time. And fast forward today, we have over 200 engineers in the Battersea Power Station that has really helped build this kind of chasing-the-sun innovation approach that SharkNinja has developed.

I think there's a lot of parallels and similarities with that here in New York, and I'm actually in New York now. I think from a creative standpoint, there is just a level of creative talent that's exceptional in New York. I think from a design perspective, I think PR, media buying, social media, we'll have a content creator studio that will be here right in Midtown. I think it's exciting that we're actually going to be designing and developing products here in Midtown Manhattan. I actually had the Dean of Columbia Engineering School here last week that was excited to send down students and interns here at the facility.

So all in all, I think it's just going to be a great magnet for talent for us. And I think it's going to blend together really well with our teams in Boston and London and around the world to just bring together the best and brightest people.

Randal Konik
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Super helpful. And I guess my last follow-up would be, when you think about the next few years and driving continued international growth. Maybe remind us kind of just the way you think about international and how big it should be as a proportion of the total business within a few years and where you see the biggest opportunities? You keep talking about massive continued growth in the U.K. and beyond.

And then, Adam, just a follow-up on gross margin. I think you talked about there's still ability to kind of bring that further higher in the years ahead. Maybe talk to some of the puts and takes you think about high level from a gross margin standpoint as we think about the next couple of years.

Mark Adam Barrocas
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Look, on the international side, I think what's most exciting is that our model is replicating globally. I mean let's start with that. I mean, if I go back a couple of years ago, people would say, well, Europe is so different. It's so fragmented. Latin America, how do you even get to that market? Is it even accessible to you? And I think we've kind of proven out that the model of disruptive consumer-focused product innovation and viral marketing that creates consumer demand is a global translatable strategy, and we're seeing that in countries around the world.

I'm very excited about Europe. I'm very excited about Latin America. But I'm also excited that we're continuing to build a strong business in the U.K. I mean there's strong nice growth in the U.K. I'll continue to reinforce that I think over time, our business in Germany, just because of the market size will ultimately be bigger than the U.K., and France, maybe a little bit smaller. But for right now, Randy, we're very focused on the path to getting to 50% of our business outside of the U.S., and that's kind of the short to midterm immediate target for us.

Adam Quigley
Interim Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And on the gross margin front, I mean, as you continue to see from us, we've expanded gross margin considerably every quarter thus far. And what we're seeing as we move forward is the changes that we're making, they're structural changes, right? We're improving our product cost through value engineering efforts. We're improving the product cost through where we source the product through the supply chain that we've talked a lot about. And also, we're entering into new categories that are commanding higher price points that have more structural higher gross margins. And so the durability of our ability to expand gross margin, I think we feel very good about going into the future because it's really -- it's no one thing. It's coming from multiple avenues.

We now have Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.

Rupesh Parikh
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

So just going back to your commentary on the inventory side, it appears to be in really good shape. I think you had a high single-digit growth this quarter. Do you believe you have the inventory right now to meet underlying demand or even stronger demand out there? Because I know at times, you guys have been inventory constrained in recent quarters.

Adam Quigley
Interim Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks for the question, Rupesh. I think where we're at with inventory right now is you saw last year, we really leaned into our balance sheet strength and brought in prebuilt inventory ahead of some of the tariffs coming into place, and that served us quite well throughout this year. What you saw in Q3 of growing about 7%, 8% year-over-year is we've got healthy inventory stock. We're not in an overstock position by any means. The stock that we have on hand, we feel good about going into the holiday season.

We've talked about some NPDs shifting in terms of timing and potentially picking that up in 2026. But overall, heading into the holiday season, I think we feel really good. And also reflecting on some of the actions that were taken a year ago, feeling really good about that and what's been able to help us on the gross margin front.

Rupesh Parikh
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Great. And then maybe just a quick follow-up question. Just on the elasticity front, we've heard from some players out there, just some of the challenges they've had in actually taking price while you guys have done quite well. So just curious what you're seeing from an elasticity perspective and overall, how you feel about your price gaps.

Mark Adam Barrocas
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Rupesh, we've taken price, but we've done it very, very cautiously. I mean we understand the consumer is challenged. I mean, we're particularly watching the impact of the government shutdown. And what we've seen to date is that we're still delivering extraordinary value to the consumer. I mean we're not the highest-priced products in the market. We're not the lowest-priced products. You could still buy a SharkNinja product for $59 or for $999. So I think we're in all of the key price points that consumers are looking for.

And as long as we continue to maintain market-leading performance and high-quality products and still deliver them to consumers at a great value, I think that will work out fine for us.

We now have Brian McNamara with Canaccord Genuity.

Brian McNamara
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

So there was a lot of concern from investors for the last several weeks heading into this print, pretty much all of which has kind of proven unfounded with these results and guidance. A number of your competitors have reported much weaker results and one common headwind has been kind of retailer inventory levels. So you had a European competitor profit warm last month and called out U.S. retailers' "wait-and-see" attitudes," while a U.S. competitor last week called out a retailer inventory adjustment in Q3 as kind of higher inventory value due to tariffs were absorbed by the market. So I'm just curious how your business was impacted by these market dynamics.

Mark Adam Barrocas
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Brian, I mean, I guess on your first point, we've delivered 10 consecutive quarters of double-digit top and bottom line growth since we've been a U.S. public company. So I can't speak to what investor concerns were specifically.

As it relates to retailer inventory, yes, I mean, we're experiencing good retailer support. I mean I think the retailers are leaning in with SharkNinja. I think they believe in our innovation. I think they believe in the demand generation that we're going to bring to them. I mean there are, of course, situations where maybe there isn't the inventory levels that we'd like them to be.

I think we distribute through lots of different channels. I mean, from dot-com to brick-and-mortar to D2C. Our job is just to make sure that our innovation is able to be purchased by consumers when we create the demand for it. And we love full retailer participation. In some cases, we get it. In some cases, we don't get it. But we still have to drive demand and fulfill orders for consumers.

Adam Quigley
Interim Chief Financial Officer

And Brian, I was just going to mention, too, I think one of the things that we can point to is our Q4 guidance is sort of the confidence that we have in the retail orders that are ahead. And so I think you're seeing that reflected also in what we've put out today.

Brian McNamara
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

Great. And then secondly, obviously, I don't want to front run '26 guidance, but you've consistently said you're a double-digit growth company. Is that a reasonable expectation for the top line next year?

Adam Quigley
Interim Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I mean, I think as we go forward, we're continuing to be very proud of where we're going to land in 2025. We're not in a position right now to give any guidance on 2026. But I think we've got a really incredible Q3 that we've just put out today, and I think we're really excited about Q4.

Your next question comes from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities.

Steven Forbes
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Mark, Adam, maybe just a follow-up on international expansion. As we look out sort of over the next couple of quarters here, I was hoping maybe for a formal update on the transitions of the international markets from third-party distribution to self-distribution. I don't know if you can give us maybe a road map to think through. And then maybe broader comments on how has the risk parameters of that transition period changed? I mean we're coming off, right, the Mexico transition. I think you talked about some optimism on a smoother transition ahead. So maybe just would love to hear your most updated thoughts as we look ahead to those transitions.

Mark Adam Barrocas
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Steve, I mean, I think the biggest -- as we talked about on previous calls, I mean, I think the biggest learning was not to approach these things from a big bang perspective that in each market, likely there is a role for a distributor, particularly in countries that do have a sizable amount of small retailers that maybe it's just not in our best interest to be working with on a direct basis. I mean you take a country like Spain, there's 4 major retailers that we're going to work with, but there's a whole lot of other retailers that we might be better off just being serviced by a distributor.

And so I think that's more of the model that we're moving towards. You're going to see that in the Nordics, you're going to see that in Poland. You're going to see that in Spain and Italy, likely see that in some countries in South America. So I think that it shouldn't be kind of an event situation. I think you should see it as more of a kind of just an ongoing smoother transition as we take over some of the larger retailer relationships and continue to partner with distributors to reach the secondary and tertiary retailers in the market.

Steven Forbes
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

And then just a quick follow-up. I don't know if you can provide maybe a formal update on the path to becoming a domestic filer. It seems to be a point of interest from your -- from investors. So I don't know if there's a formal statement that you guys can provide.

Adam Quigley
Interim Chief Financial Officer

As we look ahead to 2026, we have officially failed the foreign private issuer test. And so certainly making our way forward as a domestic filer, and that will occur in 2026. So yes, on track on that front, what we've said before.

We have Phillip Blee with William Blair.

Phillip Blee
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Adam, congrats on the new role. I wanted to focus on the beauty space a bit more. Can you maybe provide a bit of color around the consumer response to all the newness you've released in hair and skin over the past few months? What kind of lift that could have during this holiday season as a more giftable option? And then what's the opportunity to expand the availability of your skin assortment to retail partners beyond just the specialty beauty space?

Mark Adam Barrocas
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks. Phillip. Look, we're really excited about what we're doing in beauty, both in hair and in skin and what that potentially opens up for us to other categories in beauty. This will be the first holiday selling season for CryoGlow in the United States and most of Europe. So we're excited about that. We're seeing great momentum. It's the #1 selling skincare beauty device in the U.S. in just a very short period of time.

We just launched a product called the Shark FacialPro Glow. We think it's off to a great start. It won't have broad distribution in Q4, but we think it will as we start to roll it out into Q1 and Q2 and beyond. I think what's exciting about that product is the replenishment topical that is sold with it. I mean we developed that with this Korean formulation company. So I'm excited that we're not just selling a product, but we're selling a system that the consumer will kind of ongoing engage with us.

In the hair care space, we've got a lot of new innovation and technology happening, not just with what we launched today, but the pipeline of what's to come moving forward. I don't view it as that we're only looking at the beauty business to sell that in the prestige retailers. I think you're going to see broadened retail distribution from us. I mean we want to be able to positively impact everyone. We think everyone should feel beautiful with our haircare products and our skincare products.

So I think you'll continue to see broader distribution as we get into '26, but we're in very much our early stages in the expansion of our overall beauty business.

Phillip Blee
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Okay. Great. That's super helpful. And then just now that a lot of this accelerated supply chain diversification efforts are behind you and inventory levels seem to be in good shape, how do you think about the potential to accelerate the category availability in international markets more in line with what's available here in the U.S.? And then what kind of lift could that have on the segment?

Mark Adam Barrocas
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Phillip, I think inventory and our global sourcing model obviously has impacted our ability to roll out as fast as we want or fulfill as much demand as we wanted to globally. But I think there's another constraint also that we've talked about, which is marketing and just being able to invest a sufficient amount of marketing on each category to be able to get a foothold in these new markets.

I mean, let's not forget, like 3 years ago, a German consumer didn't know who Shark or Ninja was. And there was no German consumer that had our products in their homes. And so there's still a lot of brand building that's needed. I mean there's still a lot of education that we need to do in a lot of these markets.

So supply chain is a component of it, but I almost see marketing as an equal or bigger component of it. And it's just going to take us some time as we move forward. And really, I don't want to make the mistake of pushing too far too fast and not being able to support it properly from a marketing standpoint.

We have Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan now.

Andrea Teixeira
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats, Adam, on the promotion. I wanted to go back, Mark, with the commentary because you did say in the beginning of September at a competitor conference that some of the inventory may have slipped through into the fourth quarter. And you also mentioned some of the innovation also that had been planned for 2025 could come to fruition in 2026.

So I was just hoping to see if, one, that concern that some of these shipments would shift into the fourth quarter actually did not materialize at the end of the quarter. In other words, you don't have that benefit potentially in the fourth quarter. Obviously, we can do the math, but we just want to figure how consumption and shipment dynamics are unfolding and inventory levels.

And then if you think on the innovation, obviously, you have announced a very strong pipeline now. But just wondering how that pipeline compares with when you started the year or as it unfolded and how it sets you for 2026?

Adam Quigley
Interim Chief Financial Officer

Andrea, let me take the question around Q3 and Q4 and some of the retailer shipment timing. I think every year at this time, we're actively watching and monitoring daily what inventory patterns are and what the retailer shipments are. And so as the retailers ramp up for the holiday season and we also ramp up our inventory for the holiday season, that Q3, Q4 timing is often quite tricky.

I will say our sales and operations team did an incredible job to really get as much out as we could with the retailers that we had. And I think one of the items that Mark mentioned earlier in the call was retailers really view us quite favorably right now. And we know we're operating in an uncertain consumer environment and that retailers, we can't speak for them, but they're going to make their own choices and they're going to make their own bets across who they're buying inventory from and when. And I think we've positioned ourselves really well for them to prioritize us because they know that we're going to stand behind the products. They know that we're investing behind the brand and the products that we're launching. And I think they're looking to win in Q4 with us.

Mark Adam Barrocas
President, CEO & Director

Yes. In terms of the innovation, listen, I think we feel very good about the pipeline of what we've developed across lots of different categories. And as I said earlier, I think we're doing a really good job of innovating in the base. And that's something that I really want to reinforce to investors because we have a great healthy base business, which is the foundation of the overall business that we've created. So things like BlendBOSS and things like Crispi Pro and things like improvements to our core vacuum business, those are all, I think, really, really exciting that maybe do not get some of the fanfare out there that they should.

Thank you. I can confirm that does conclude the question-and-answer session here. And that does conclude today's call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect, and please enjoy the rest of your day.
