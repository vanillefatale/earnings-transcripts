[Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Theresa Chen of Barclays.

Theresa Chen
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Looking at the macro outlook, certainly, we're seeing inventories building coupled with relatively high domestic utilization as well as what seems like precarious supply and demand setup given significant capacity slated to come online in Asia balanced against limited closures for the year. And in light of these developments, how do you view the evolution of supply and demand dynamics for light products and crack spreads going forward?

Gary Simmons
Executive VP & COO

Yes, Theresa, this is Gary. Certainly, during November and December, we saw a fairly significant build in total light product inventory. It followed typical seasonal patterns, but the magnitude of the build was much larger than what we typically see. So we kind of went from below the 5-year average on total light product inventory to above the 5-year average. We didn't see anything abnormal in product demand in our system. Gasoline sales in the fourth quarter were flat year-over-year. Distillate sales in our system were actually up 13%. And I would tell you that's probably more related to a change in our customer mix than anything else. But good domestic demand.

Our exports quarter-over-quarter were up. Exports year-over-year were up. So again, good demand in the product market. But really what caused the inventory build is exactly what you alluded to, we just ran very high refinery utilization. So especially in December, where you were at 95.4% utilization, very strong for that time of year. I think some of that was related to the very strong margin environment we had in November. Cooler weather allows you to push utilization rates as well.

The thing that's really interesting to us is almost all that inventory build was in PADD 3. And we've always stated we like our position in PADD 3 because it allows you to clear any link to the export markets. We didn't really build any inventory during the fourth quarter, didn't see any economic incentive to carry inventory or produce summer-grade gasoline. So we're not really sure what caused the inventory build in PADD 3.

Going forward, when you look at 2026, most of the consultant data would show similar supply-demand balances to last year, but they are assuming lower refinery utilization, refinery utilization coming back to normal levels. I think we agree with that. You've already seen utilization drop as we start into turnaround activity. As we wrap up turnarounds, I think you get into warmer weather, which, again, it's hard to push refinery utilization due to some overhead temperature limits.

With the assumption of more normal refinery utilization to us, it looks like demand is outpacing additional supply. Our numbers would indicate about 400,000 barrels a day of net capacity additions. We're showing about 500,000 barrels a day of total light product demand growth. So things look tight in the consultant data. There's also a lot of assumptions in the consultant data. They assume Russian refining capacity comes on, runs normally. They assume a lot of the new capacity that's starting up runs at nameplate assumptions around bio and renewable diesel coming back into the market in a strong way. And then really no refinery rationalization outside of what's already been announced.

So I would say our outlook is a little more bullish than what the consultants are showing just because we believe execution risk remains high on a lot of those assumptions that I just mentioned. Really difficult to get much of a read on the market thus far this year, mainly due to the weather. I can tell you that first couple of weeks in January were fairly soft on domestic demand. That's typically the case. Things have started to recover nicely. Last week, we were back up to around 1 million barrels a day on U.S. wholesale, but then we had the winter storm hit. So last weekend, we saw wholesale liftings that were about 40% of the prior weekend, it's remained soft this week, but gradually recovering. Sales yesterday were about 90% of normal, continue to see good export demand, diesel export arb to Europe is open. Diesel exports into Latin America are economic, good gasoline demand into Latin America. And then we don't see an arb to really send winter-grade gasoline to New York Harbor. So all of those things are constructive.

Theresa Chen
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Super helpful. Thank you, Gary. Looking at the feedstock side of things with the Venezuelan crude being rerouted to the Gulf Coast, how much of this can be absorbed within your footprint over time? And can you also elaborate on how you see this impacting differentials without a meaningful and immediate increase in Venezuelan production itself, how do you see this equilibrating over time? And what are the implications for both Gulf Coast light heavy diffs as well as light heavy diffs in the Mid-Con given the related impact to WCS.

Randy Hawkins

Theresa, this is Randy. I'll kick that off. Obviously, having the Venezuela supply kind of back in the fold for our system is great news. The exports that are coming out of Venezuela tend to be very heavy, high sulfur, high acid and that fits our configuration pretty well. In fact, if you look over the last 10 years, Valero has been the largest purchaser of Venezuelan heavy crude more than any other U.S. refiner. Historically, you look back and we ran as much as 240,000 barrels a day of Venezuelan heavy in our system. However, that was prior to the new coker project at Port Arthur that was installed in 2023. That project has substantially increased our processing capability for heavy crude. So we'd expect our Venezuelan processing capability to be substantially north of that number now.

Kind of looking at differentials, I mean not only Venezuela, but we've had several beneficial factors that have occurred to kind of help move this market weaker. After last year with discounts fairly tight, most of these market moves tend to -- are making differential increasingly favorable for refiners with high complexity refineries, such as ours.

OPEC increases have announced 2.9 million since April of last year. We've seen growing sour crude production in the U.S. Gulf. So it's now over 2 million barrels a day. That's up about 200,000 barrels from a year ago. We've seen a resumption of the Kirkuk exports that started in October. And we continue to see high production -- growing production out of Canada that's been helpful.

One other factor that's been helping discounts is freight rates have been sharply higher. If we look at current rates compared to where we were in the fourth quarter, freight's up about 30%. So when freight goes up since the U.S. barrel must price to clear, it's having to have wider discounts in order to allow those exports to happen. So right now, we're seeing heavy Canadian in the Gulf Coast, trading at about $11 to $11.50 under Brent. That's about $4 cheaper than our Q4 average. And similarly, Mars in the Gulf has been around $5 discount to Brent, that's about $1 kind of cheaper than we were in the fourth quarter. So all looks pretty favorable. I think, for discounts kind of heading into 2026.

The next question is coming from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs.

Neil Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Yes. First question, I guess this would be for you, Homer, would be around return of capital. Last year, you guys were pretty strong versus, I think, what market expected. Just -- we do get the question with the stock having done well. How aggressive you will continue to be around buying back stock and love your perspective on that, especially as you step into the CFO seat.

Homer Bhullar
Senior VP & CFO

Neil, I'll start. Obviously, returning excess free cash flow to our shareholders through share repurchases has been a pretty core tenet of our capital allocation framework, right, for over a decade, and we reduced our share count by over 40% since 2014. So maybe I'll just talk a little bit about the framework. So it all starts with the balance sheet, right? It's in one of the best positions in the industry. If you look at our net debt to cap ratio at 18%, it's actually below our long-term target of 20% to 30%.

Our year-end cash balance was at $4.7 billion, again towards the high end of our target range of $4 billion to $5 billion, so we don't really have any pressing need to pay down debt or build more cash. So then let's move to like the discretionary uses of cash, right? I'm not going to mention sustaining CapEx and dividend, which we obviously consider nondiscretionary. So on the discretionary side, you've got growth projects, you've got acquisitions and share repurchases, right? So starting with growth projects, we're going to be guided by our minimum return threshold, right? We're going to stay disciplined.

On acquisitions, same, we have to see good strategic value and a clear and quantifiable assessment of synergies. So we're not going to just do growth projects or acquisitions just because we have excess cash. So absent those uses of cash, we're going to continue to lean into share repurchases. And if you think about share repurchases, there's always like an underlying ratable part of share repurchases to meet our minimum commitment of 40% to 50%. And then beyond that, we do look for opportunities to be more aggressive around share repurchases, and that's really any given period where we see weakness, particularly if our share price is weak on a relative basis to the broader sector.

And to your point on stock trading near all-time highs, I mean, you go back 10 years when the stock was trading around $50 to $60, we've been getting that question ever since then. And for what it's worth, our return on buybacks is above mid-teens over that 10-year period with where the share price is today. And frankly, I hope we keep getting the same question for the next 10 years because that means the stock is doing well.

Neil Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Yes. That's a great answer, Homer. The follow-up is just we are seeing heavy start to discount, particularly Western Canadian crude. And so I just -- there was a story out there that some of the folks who are marketing the Venezuelan barrels were trying to bid them in pretty tight into the Gulf Coast, maybe even move it into China. I just think from your guys' perspective, you have options for heavies, including Western Canadian down on the Gulf Coast. If you could expand a little bit more on that specifically as you see the go forward for the barrels that are being marketed in, you think they're going to have to compete a little bit wider in order to compete with your alternatives?

Randy Hawkins

Neil, this is Randy. I'll comment a bit on that. We're not going to comment on pricing for deals that we've done. But I'll just say that we're evaluating Venezuelan crude like we always do for all of our alternatives. We've put it into the basket of alternatives, and we will purchase Venezuelan crude if it beats our alternatives. So you've seen all the articles I read them as well. Looking forward, we've already kind of engaged with the 3 authorized sellers of crude and we purchased barrels from all 3. So we anticipate the Venezuelan crude making up a pretty large part of our heavy diet as we move into February and March.

The next question is coming from Manav Gupta of UBS.

Manav Gupta
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

First, wanted to congratulate Brian on the new role of Investor Relations. And then also really wanted to congratulate the incoming CFO for pushing the stock price to an all-time high, very quickly. On a more serious note, Homer, look, even when we go back 4 or 5 years, for the same refining margin, what we are seeing is the cash flow profile of the company is different. You're producing more cash even if the margin was the same 4 or 5 years ago, can you help us understand the dynamics over there? Like what's been behind this transition to generate the -- ability to generate more cash with the same refining margin?

Homer Bhullar
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Manav, so Lane talked about this in the past, but it's really a result of a number of things. And it all starts with being a good operator, having discipline around capital investments and then a strong balance sheet, which ultimately all translate to higher cash flow and higher shareholder returns. So starting with operations, we've obviously worked really hard to manage costs in our reliability over the years, and you can see that with the record throughput and mechanical availability this past year.

And then we've also been very disciplined around growth investments. Obviously, you know our minimum return threshold, which effectively ensures you have a good return when things are good, but also hopefully protects us with a return that's well above our cost of capital even in kind of a downside scenario.

And you can see that if you look at our return on equity or return on invested capital over the last 5 or 10 years, that's in the mid-teens or higher number. And again, keep that -- keep in mind that denominator for that return on equity or return on invested capital includes all capital, right, including sustaining CapEx. And then also generally on capital, we have been trending a little bit lower in recent years, which just frees up more free cash flow for shareholder returns.

Lastly, I mean, the balance sheet obviously plays a strong role in that, both in terms of we've got lower debt and higher cash balance. So at the margin, you have lower interest expense but then higher interest income as well. But really more importantly, just having a strong balance sheet gives you much more flexibility with respect to shareholder returns. And then lastly, obviously, on a per share base, the share repurchases have helped a lot as well.

Manav Gupta
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

All very good points. My quick follow-up here is a very good improvement in renewable diesel. I know there were a few quarters where the industry struggled, you did much better than the industry, but the industry was struggling. Are we finally seeing at the light end of this tunnel where possible RVO and then all those policies will become clear? And do you expect generally a renewable diesel to deliver better earnings in 2026 versus '25, primarily a function of more maybe policy clarity, if you could talk about that.

Eric Fisher
Senior Vice President of Product Supply, Trading & Wholesale

Yes, Manav, this is Eric. You're exactly right. We're still waiting on final policy guidance on the RVO and PTC. And so if you contrast the first half of '25 being the transition to PTC and everyone trying to understand that we were the first and perhaps maybe the only company that has really figured out how to capture the PTC. So the second half of '25 was getting into full PTC capture, getting into full SAF commercialization and between that differentiation, our ability to capture the PTC and the overall margins tightening in renewable diesel allowed us to outcompete a lot of our competitors. And as we have started 2026, there's a lot of capacity off-line. There's a lot of players that are now sitting out waiting for guidance to get finalized before they reenter the market, and that has caused fat prices to really level off and even drop throughout the fourth quarter and into this first quarter.

So what I see in '26 is a policy should be a tailwind. The expectation is it should come out favorably for renewables. We do see that there's a lot of talk -- and tariffs continue to be a pretty strong headwind but we'll see what the Supreme Court comes out with. And so I think you're going to see 2026 starting off more like the second half of '25, and so that would indicate a stronger year in '26 versus '25.

The next question is coming from Douglas Leggate of Wolfe Research.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
Wolfe Research, LLC

I'm sure Brian has already told you about my family connection, but welcome, Brian. Guys, I wonder if I could just ask 2 quick ones. First of all, on all the dynamics of heavy oil in the Gulf Coast, there's obviously a lot of complexities. But across your system, Mexico looks like it's now running a little better, so less imports or less exports rather from there, WCS is TMX. And then, of course, there's Venezuela. And my question really is about your coker utilization and the volume of your heavy runs, where that can get to, not the crude utilization but where you can actually get your throughput to. And my specific question is, 10 years ago, 15 years ago, you were running about 1.3 million barrels a day of advantaged crude, including fuel oil. You've added the coker, you're less than 1 million today. Where can that get to?

Lane Riggs
CEO, President & Chairman

So Doug, it's Lane. I'll answer this one. If you really look at what happened, we did sort of when we added the coker because of the dynamics you're talking about in terms of heavy availability. What we really did is we incremented medium and light crude with some heavy actually ramping up into higher rates to ensure that our coker availability, our coker sort of utilization was where we felt like it needed to be to meet FID. We're also purchasing outside resids. So we're doing all that. I think what you can expect is you get more avails from Venezuela, more avails from Canada, you'll see us actually fill the coker up sooner with that crude diet. And we'll see on an incremental basis where we actually increase crude rates or actually lower them depending on how incremental crude economics because we believe there will be a driver to fill the coker with heavy.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
Wolfe Research, LLC

Lane, is it possible to give a utilization rate on your coker capacity today and where it could get to? Or is that too granular?

Lane Riggs
CEO, President & Chairman

I don't know we've ever really been public with coker utilization. In fact, I don't think we even have it in front of us. So -- but we normally from -- just from a signaling perspective, most of the time, we optimize the crude diet into sort of the way you would do it and then we purchase outside feed or internal resid feed to make sure that, that coker is full most of the time.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
Wolfe Research, LLC

All right. That's helpful, guys. My follow-up is actually on one of Manav's questions about the RVO and RIN prices have obviously spiked here pretty dramatically since the start of the year. I'm trying to understand how should we think -- I don't know if there is such a thing as mid-cycle earnings, but at today's RIN price, obviously, we're up around the -- I think we're at [ $120 ] or something today per gallon. What do you think the mid-cycle earnings capacity of DGDs is or maybe free cash flow, whichever one you prefer to lean on? And I'll leave it there.

Eric Fisher
Senior Vice President of Product Supply, Trading & Wholesale

Yes, that's not really a question that you can easily come up with an answer on about mid-cycle for RIN. What I would say is you've kind of been a new framework with the PTC. So the previous 10 years of DGD was on the blenders tax credit. So everyone gets $1 cash from the government for every gallon that you produce. Now we're into a regime where it is dependent on your CI, it's dependent on your income tax because it's now an income tax credit. So you're into a different -- just an overall different framework.

Now RINs have been underlying this will be a part of this in the past as it will -- as it is going forward. I think as we think about where this all goes what the government has suggested as an obligation range of 5.2 billion to 5.6 billion gallons for '26 and '27 is well above domestic production capability. So if you see that and with the combination of tariffs on foreign feedstocks and the elimination of credits for foreign imports, the entire compliant -- essentially, you're raising the obligation while also making it harder to generate. That all points to a higher D4 RIN price, especially as you draw the bank down, which a 5.2 to 5.6 obligation number would certainly do.

And so what I would say is it's not really trying to think about what a mid-cycle is more just saying that there's a good chance D4 RINs are going to go up.

And so then the next question is, does fat prices just follow that up and keep overall RD margins tight? Or do you see from a competitive standpoint, going back to the PTC, that low CI and the ability to run waste oils over veg oils, is still going to have an advantage in this new framework of PTC. So all of that just really saying 2026 is going to likely look better than 2025 for the segment, and then it particularly looks better for those that can export into advantaged markets into Canada and Europe and the U.K., those that operate just like refining the most efficient capacity in the Gulf Coast, and then those that can run waste oils over veg oils.

The next question is coming from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Lane, I don't know whether you guys will be willing to share. That's a -- as usual, every several years that we have the labor contract being negotiated and Marathon is heading that with the USW. And can you tell us that which of your refinery is currently under that contract? So in other words that if there's -- in case if there's any strike, I'm sure that you guys are well prepared, management will be able to take care of it for a period of time. But which refinery or what percent of your capacity is actually will be impacted?

Second question is that I think that has been answered previously. If we look back in your utilization rate, historically, I think on a full year basis that your maximum may be doing somewhere in the 94%, 95%. Do you believe, given you've been -- it looks like that have been done a phenomenon job in operating your facility better and better. Do you think that now on a maximum full cycle basis that you will be able to do better than that? Or that I mean that the entire curve have been shifted up, what I mean they're comparing to maybe 10 years ago, what 1% or 2%? Is there anything that you can help to quantify it?

Lane Riggs
CEO, President & Chairman

Paul, it's Lane. I'll take a stab at the first one. I just -- yes, so your instincts are correct. We're very -- we're not really going to disclose exactly where -- which one of our sites and everything are under USW and some of the other maybe unions that are out there. What I will say, one of the advantages that Valero has versus our competitors in that space, however you think about it is we're less unionized directionally than a lot of the other people in the space. I don't buy everybody, but directionally, that's true. And on the second one, I guess it's...

Gary Simmons
Executive VP & COO

Yes. So I think, Paul, what I'd tell you is we obviously had a record year in terms of mechanical availability last year. With better mechanical availability, you would expect to see better refinery utilization to try to quantify that would be very difficult.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Gary, do you think that the whole industry is getting better?

Gary Simmons
Executive VP & COO

It's a good question. I think a lot of what you saw in the fourth quarter was very strong margins and moderate temperatures. And so that allows you to kind of push refinery hardware a little bit harder than you normally could. I think it will come back off. I don't think what we saw in December is sustainable, but everyone is certainly trying to drive up mechanical availability as we have.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

And that you're talking about the weather. Do you guys have any noticeable downtime from the winter? That's my last question.

Gary Simmons
Executive VP & COO

Yes, Paul, we really fared the winter storm pretty well. We had a few nuisance-type heater trips, but nothing material. I think most of what we saw was really things external to the refinery, some interruptions in hydrogen steam hitting up against product containment type limits. But if you look at our guidance, I would tell you, there was nothing material that related to the winter storm that's going to impact the quarter.

The next question is coming from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler.

Ryan Todd
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Maybe one on West Coast, if you could just talk a little bit about West Coast refining. A couple of things, maybe profitability was a little weaker in the quarter. Can you maybe talk about what some of the drivers were there? And then, can you maybe walk us through the time line of the coming shutdown of Benicia and how you're thinking about West Coast dynamics for 2026?

Gary Simmons
Executive VP & COO

Yes. I'll start on the first. Yes, our capture rates were a little down on the West Coast, some of that is to do with the fact that gasoline relative to diesel, gasoline was pretty weak relative to diesel. As we've talked about, especially our Benicia refinery has a really strong gasoline yield. And so it tends to lower our capture rates. The other thing that hurt us is there was a retroactive tariff adjustment on one of the pipelines we utilize on the West Coast and all those charges hit during the fourth quarter. So those are the 2 big things that impacted our capture rates in the fourth quarter on the West Coast.

Richard Walsh
Executive VP & General Counsel

And this is Rich Walsh. I'll try to answer on the time line there. In terms of the Benicia idling, we're executing our plan to safely idle it, the refinery operating units that is. And it's a well planned out and phased process. And in February, we -- I'm sure you saw our most recent announcement, we will be idling the process units because they have some mandatory inspection requirements that are kicking in then. And so we'll be pulling those offline.

And -- but we will be continuing to produce fuel as we work down the inventory through this process. And as we've shared with the governor and the CEC, we are going to be importing some gasoline and/or gasoline blend components over the near term. And we remain committed to our contractual obligations out there to meet the supply obligations that we have. So we're working cooperatively with state officials, the CEC and the governor on our plans, and we've kept them fully informed and they're aware of our supplemental supply commitments to the Bay Area. So I think that's pretty much where we are. And then in terms of Wilmington, it's normal operations, and we'll continue to supply the California market out of Wilmington.

Ryan Todd
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Great. And then maybe -- just maybe one follow-up for you, Eric, on the RVO stuff. Any thoughts in terms of what you're hearing on timing or any of the items which are kind of debated out there, whether it's SREs or reallocations or penalties for foreign feeds or products, directionally, what you're hearing on those things?

Eric Fisher
Senior Vice President of Product Supply, Trading & Wholesale

Yes. That's really kind of a government question. I'm going to let Rich touch that.

Richard Walsh
Executive VP & General Counsel

Yes. I mean, Look, EPA has got a big challenge in dealing with the RVO right now and the SREs in this -- I think the administration is starting to recognize how now that all of this is getting caught up with these SREs. They've really gotten out of hand. If you look at EPA, they sort of defaulted to this outdated DOE process at the government accounting office has already said, was a flawed process in both EPA and DOE had acknowledged that previously. And this matrix is so out of date, it doesn't even account for the shale revolution in the domestic production, which is completely transforming the U.S. energy market. So it's a really flawed SRE basis that's out there.

And in terms of solutions, I mean, I think there is a legislative proposal out there that's a compromise that's supported by API, by ag interest, by retail trades and most refiners that would allow a process to go forward that would kind of help correct all this and get us kind of realigned and supporting the RFS. But there are a small number of conglomerate so-called small refiners that are out there that are having windfall on these SREs and they're kind of holding it up. So that's where we think this stuff is going to have to be worked out. And it's a challenge for the agency that kind of gotten into a fix with overissuing these SREs.

The next question is coming from Paul Sankey of Sankey Research.

Paul Sankey
Sankey Research LLC

Glad to hear Brian, that you got the job because of your close family relationship to Doug Leggate, but I joke. Just on demand and supply at the moment, obviously, we're seeing oil through $70. Is that -- would you say that's related to the sanctions and shadow fleet being shut down effectively or more shut down than it has been. I'm just wondering it's a big surprise I think to all of us. There's obviously the demand side of the equation. And I was just wondering what your perspective is on U.S. oil demand right now in the storm because we're seeing some big numbers from some of the Northeastern generators, I mean, 300,000-plus type daily use of oil to generate power. You didn't seem to really highlight that in your very complete comments so far. I just wondered if you're seeing a big impact from the storm in terms of the demand side of the equation, which might help to explain why we're at $70. So the overall question is how come we've gone through $70 here at a time seasonally of weak oil prices.

Randy Hawkins

Yes, Paul, I'll just touch on the flat price. I mean I think what we're seeing right now with the geopolitical wrangling going on in Iran, I think has put quite a bit of a geopolitical risk factor on top of flat price plus you had the winter storm take off some oil production in the shale patch in addition to the continued issues with the CPC and Tengiz over in Kazakhstan that had quite a bit of oil offline. So I think all those are leading to some short-term tightness plus the geopolitical factors that's kind of running up oil here in the short term?

Gary Simmons
Executive VP & COO

Yes. In terms of heating oil demand, I think a lot of that is just where we have a strong wholesale presence, we're not really strong in the heating oil markets. In markets like Boston, where we do have a presence, we have seen a significant uplift in diesel demand as a result of heating oil. And then the rest of it for us, a strong incentive to shift to New York Harbor, which is again tied to heating oil demand.

Paul Sankey
Sankey Research LLC

Great. And if I could ask a follow-up. Lane, is there a way that you could see more investment as you shut down California? I'm wondering how your exposure to California is going to change if you're going to kind of effectively exit that market or if you have access to it through other means? And secondly, whether or not you would consider perhaps with more heavy oil coming back on the market with the decline of potential certainly decline of U.S. light sweet production whether there might be more CapEx to be undertaken?

Lane Riggs
CEO, President & Chairman

Paul, this is Lane. I don't think you'll see our CapEx increase with respect to the West Coast. As a matter of fact, I'd have to go back and look how long. We've sort of -- we've -- obviously, what we've done out there is to maintain our sustaining capital for all these years with respect to the West Coast because we didn't see a market that we were going to grow the capacity to produce into it. So what you're actually going to see is as we shut Benicia down, our sustaining CapEx should fall. I'm going to pick a number, somewhere around $150 million-ish, so our sustaining capital actually fall.

With respect to how we see California, it's still a very -- it's a challenge to operate out there. We'll continue to operate Wilmington. It's a good asset and a good market. It has its challenges with respect to regulatory capital at the end of the decade, and that's when we'll sort of make our decision on how we'll -- how our presence in the West Coast will with -- how it will be.

Paul Sankey
Sankey Research LLC

And anything on incremental spending on a heavier slate going forward potentially, Lane?

Lane Riggs
CEO, President & Chairman

No, not on the West Coast. Meaning the entire footprint -- Yes. We'll definitely look at that in terms of our strategic cap. We are looking at that. We have things that we have in our gated process. We don't necessarily -- our tendency as a company is to talk about projects as we FID and not as we are studying them. But we have a pretty good position as it is. So we want to make sure that we don't hurt that position, but clearly, as we -- there's more avails in the heavy oil market and we hit these constraints again, we'll study. We'll see what it would take to do -- it will probably still fit into the small CapEx. We're not going to do a great coker expansion or anything like that, that's not the foreseeable future.

The next question is coming from Sam Margolin of Wells Fargo.

Sam Margolin
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

On revisiting CapEx, growth CapEx is pretty moderated. I think you've explained why. Just drilling into it, how much is inflation a factor with the gated process and returns? And if it is a big factor, what do you think that means for sort of buy versus build decision-making to the extent that you're interested in growth?

Lane Riggs
CEO, President & Chairman

Sam, I will back up and explain the kind of our strategic CapEx. If you really go back for a long time, and we feel like we have the capacity to strategically develop about $1.5 billion of strategic CapEx. When we went into COVID, we sort of lowered that number to about $0.5 billion, really emphasizing at the time renewables, the renewable side of the business.

So if you kind of -- if you look at the trend of where we've been for like the past 5 years or 6 years or something like that, our half of the joint venture where we're spending about $250 million-ish of CapEx with respect to R&D, but with all the policy uncertainty, starting last year and on an ongoing basis until we get some more clarity on how all that will work, you'll -- that's falling, right?

Our refining CapEx -- strategic CapEx is fairly stable, and it is in that sort of 300-ish to -- $300-ish million kind of number. And that is -- I'm not going to -- with respect to inflation, what I will say about inflation and gated process is it does make these projects more difficult to do because the cost of building has gone up. I mean our -- as an example, our Alky costs, I don't know, $350 million, $400 million, and now they're up -- we costed one out not too long ago, it's more like $600 million. So when you -- it is -- you have to think about forward price set and do you believe the forward price that is going to accommodate the inflationary cost of standing up units. And obviously, we are always interested in existing assets. We look at them through a lens of are there other arbitrages with our current system either through sort of, I would call, processing arbitrage or trading arbitrage. That's how we like to think of these things. And we're obviously -- we always look at those and through -- and particularly through that lens.

Got it. Okay. And then just revisiting heavy crude for a second. I know there's competitive reasons why you might not want to give an exact number of what the headroom is for incremental barrels. But maybe we could frame it this way. On crude valuation, just like while TMX has been ramping and availability has been low, do you have just kind of a ballpark number off the top of your head of how much you think heavy crude globally has sort of been overvalued from a refinery economics perspective and where it could normalize to, whether that's freight costs or some other method that you use?

Randy Hawkins

Sam, this is Randy. Probably difficult to kind of give a value. I just will maybe talking back to 2025 when differentials on the sours were all pretty narrow. And we got to a point where we were indifferent on running sweet crude versus sour for most of the year, especially through Q2 and Q3. I think where we're at today, it's firmly planted. We're going to buy as much on the heavy and medium side as we can to fill up the cokers and downstream units.

The next question is coming from Joe Laetsch of Morgan Stanley.

Joseph Laetsch
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. Eric, can you talk a bit about the ethanol segment? The segment continues to perform well from both the volume and capture standpoint. Can you unpack some of the drivers here? And then as part of that, I was hoping you could talk about how you think about the potential impact and probability of nationwide E15?

Eric Fisher
Senior Vice President of Product Supply, Trading & Wholesale

Sure. Yes. Ethanol has had another good year and continues to, as Lane said, break throughput records as we've kind of grown capacity -- capacity creep for the last couple of years and have plans to continue to creep capacity in the ethanol segment. The corn crop has been good the last 2 years. So we see essentially cheap feedstock as one of the big drivers. And then I think overall, it's easy to see with the way export demand has grown that the world is figuring out that ethanol is a very cheap source of octane. And so we've seen a lot of growth in ethanol exports, there's also continued growth in ethanol as a low-carbon solution. So we see a lot of programs that are now allowing first-gen ethanol into low-carbon programs. So between those 2 things, you've seen export demand grows. So the ethanol segment continues to be very competitive and flow a lot of cash.

I think in terms of E15, all of our ethanol plants are registered to sell E15. That's -- we still see very slow customer acceptance of that, but it is slowly growing. I think that's one of those that if and when that happens, we're positioned to take advantage of that. And it's just a question of how this RVO policy is going to work out. So Rich alluded to, this is all wrapped up in the entire SRE conversation and this idea that what part of renewables is going to -- what part is renewables going to play in the domestic slate is what we're waiting for clarification on. I don't know, Rich, if you had other comments about E15?

Richard Walsh
Executive VP & General Counsel

No. I mean I do think it's -- the national E15 waiver is caught up with this SRE issue, and you can't have anything that's going to undermine the RFS, like these SREs are doing. And so I think you're going to see ag and most of refinery aligned on how to go forward with [indiscernible] and a solution for SRE over authorization. And so those will have to be...

Joseph Laetsch
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

That's helpful. And then shifting to the refining side. I was hoping to get your perspective on the fuel oil market here. Cracks weakened recently, which I think is driven by the prospects of more Venezuela crude, but I was hoping to get your thoughts on the recent dynamics and outlook here for fuel oil as it relates to coker economics.

Randy Hawkins

Yes. This is Randy again. I would say, yes, things look really weak right now. I think we're hit 79% on high-sulfur fuel oil this morning, if I look at the paper. I think it's what you mentioned before, more heavy crude in the market. We're also seeing some of the Venezuelan fuel get pointed to the U.S., at least get offered this way which are barrels that normally didn't get shown into the U.S. market. We're also seeing a little bit higher runs out of Mexico, which they tend to make fuel incrementally. So there's more barrels that are getting pointed this way as well.

So all that's kind of pushing freight costs are high. So there's typically a movement from the west to the east on fuel oil. So the higher freight goes, the West just needs to discount more.

The next question is coming from Phillip Jungwirth of BMO Capital Markets.

Phillip Jungwirth
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

As far as Russia, how are you seeing the EU refinery loophole sanctions impacting diesel markets? And could there be a greater call on U.S. Gulf Coast barrels and tougher question to answer, but it's been acquired a month as far as drone strikes on Russian refineries. Just how are you thinking about the fundamental versus geopolitical tightness in diesel cracks currently?

Gary Simmons
Executive VP & COO

Yes, this is Gary. I think overall, you are seeing EU shy away from Russian diesel barrels, thus far, we've seen that being able to rebalance throughout other parts of the world. I think the big area we saw some of those barrels were going to South America, we've seen those South American markets return to the U.S. Gulf Coast, which has been supportive of the U.S. Gulf Coast market. I don't know we have seen a fairly quiet month in terms of drone attacks on Russia. What happens there going forward. I really don't have any insight.

Phillip Jungwirth
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. Great. And then this might be a short answer, but you've always said you'll stay out of the Citgo auction. But just given the regime changes in Venezuela, is there any reason you might revisit the stance depending on what happens with the process here?

Lane Riggs
CEO, President & Chairman

Yes. This is Lane. It's still -- I mean, if anything, it's added a degree of uncertainty to the process, I think, again. So we're still sort of -- we chose to stay out of it because of the uncertainty of the process, the length of it all, just all the difficulty with respect to how that would all work. And I don't know that our change with respect to Venezuela has made that clearer. I would say, like we always do, we're obviously interested in any assets that become open or there gets to be more certainty around the process that might change the way we think of it.

The next question is coming from Jean Ann Salisbury of Bank of America.

Jean Ann Salisbury
BofA Securities, Research Division

Capture in the North Atlantic has outperformed in recent quarters. Is this driven by closure-related tightness in Europe? And do you view it as a structural shift?

Gary Simmons
Executive VP & COO

Yes. I think a lot of it has been. From our Pembroke refinery, our highest netback barrels are the ones that we can sell domestically. And as people have chosen to exit that market, we've seen our wholesale volumes grow in the U.K. significantly, and it certainly improves the capture rate when that happens.

Jean Ann Salisbury
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. And then as a follow-up, both refined products pipeline open seasons were extended, and I believe one now offers a path to multiple California markets now. Do you still prefer, as you kind of said on previous calls, to move product waterborne, thinking that, that's a better solution here?

Gary Simmons
Executive VP & COO

Yes. So overall, there's a lot of volatility in the California market. And so we hate to be committed to a pipeline that has a shipping into closed arbs. We like the optimization opportunities from waterborne supply. You can supply the barrels from anywhere in the world. The one thing I would clarify is we have a significant commitment to supply the market in Phoenix and to the extent one of these pipeline projects offers us a more efficient way to get to the Phoenix market, we would certainly entertain that.

The next question is coming from Matthew Blair of Tudor, Pickering, Holt.

Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, LLC, Research Division

You touched on the 45Z for your renewable diesel segment. But are you going to be recording 45Z credits in your ethanol segment in 2026 due to removal of the indirect land use change? And if so, do you have approximate EBITDA benefit it might be. We're estimating somewhere between like $50 million and $100 million.

Eric Fisher
Senior Vice President of Product Supply, Trading & Wholesale

Yes, this is Eric. We are looking at that very closely. So what I'd say is, given our experience with PTC through DGD, we have set the ethanol segment up to capture PTC from a prevailing wage and qualified sales standpoint. So really, we're just waiting on final guidance from the PTC to be able to answer your question directly. But what I would say is we are poised to capture whatever the PTC is going to give us. And you could -- what I will add is it works in $0.10 increments. So if you qualify, you'll get $0.10 or $0.20 a gallon for whatever they ultimately define as qualified sales. So you can speculate on how that's all going to work. But really, yes, we are poised to capture PTC in the ethanol segment. We're just waiting on finalization of guidance.

Matthew Blair
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, LLC, Research Division

And one follow-up on the Venezuela discussion. You mentioned you're already running more Venezuelan crude in the first quarter. What barrels are you pushing out to do that? Are you shifting to an overall heavier crude slate for pushing out lights and mediums? Or are you pushing out other heavies?

Randy Hawkins

Yes, this is Randy. It's kind of a mix of everything. I mean depending on the location, it may be some incremental fuel oil cargoes. It may be some Latin America heavy, and it could be Canadian heavy. So it's kind of a bit of a mix. But I would say, as mentioned before, we are pushing to maximize heavy crude processing in the system going forward with the better differentials.

The next question is coming from Jason Gabelman of TD Cowen.

Jason Gabelman
TD Cowen, Research Division

I wanted to ask another one on the crude quality diffs, given they've widened out quite a bit. And I know you kind of mentioned a bunch of reasons why that is. But if we kind of look back a few years prior to COVID, it seems like there was more kind of sour availability back then than there is now. But at the same time, differentials look wider today than they were prior to COVID. So I guess the question is, do you think that the levels we're at today are sustainable? Are there reasons why the differential should be wider now than they were prior to COVID?

Randy Hawkins

Yes. This is Randy, again. I mean I don't know that I have a firm answer on where -- what we think market should be. I think the things that I mentioned before, are kind of chief reasons, and I don't see those really going away as we head through the year. Probably the one thing on the freight side that is kind of pressuring differentials down in the prompt as freight rates have went up significantly. That's kind of resulted in more enforcement on some of these shadow fleet vessels and that could be with us as we head through the rest of the year.

Jason Gabelman
TD Cowen, Research Division

Got it. Great. And my quick follow-up is just on 2026 throughput. And it seems like sustaining CapEx is down a couple of hundred million dollars versus what you've done in the past couple of years. So is that an indication that mechanical availability should be higher and given your track record of squeezing out more barrels out of the system, should we expect kind of throughput excluding the shutdown of Benicia to continue to improve?

Lane Riggs
CEO, President & Chairman

It's Lane. I would say you can attribute most of it. There's timing, obviously, timing year-over-year differences. But a big part of it is we -- is Benicia. We have one less refinery to do sustaining capital on.
