[Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Andy Barish with Jefferies.

Andrew Barish
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Last quarter, you kind of stack rank some of the choppiness in same-store sales from the steak lap to a little bit of consumer balances to the honeymoon. Can you kind of just let us know on the honeymoon side of things, if that's changed materially? And I'm assuming most of the choppiness you're seeing now is macro-related, but anything geographically you want to point out would be helpful.

Tricia Tolivar
Chief Financial Officer

Andy, thanks for the question. So certainly, the honeymoon impact is very similar to what we experienced last quarter, no change there. We're not seeing anything geographically to call out. So it's more around the macro environment and the pressure on the consumer and certainly lapping the strong same-restaurant sales results that we had in the third quarter of the prior year. So we've noted it on the call, but on 2-year stack basis, we, in fact, accelerated our same-restaurant sales by 350 basis points to 20%.

Our next question comes from Brian Mullan with Piper Sandler.

Brian Mullan
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Just a question on the salmon test. Brett, in the prepared remarks, it sounds like it's going well. Just wondering if you could elaborate a bit on what you're seeing in test. Anything interesting from a daypart perspective between lunch and dinner or maybe just a guest perspective, age, gender, income just -- and also how it's going with the operations?

Brett Schulman
Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Brian, for the question. We did know we have TurboChef ovens in every restaurant now, which is the equipment we use to roast the salmon. So it's a very easy cook procedure and prep and whole procedure. And we've been very encouraged by the results. We have seen it drive incremental occasions and its appeal has been broad-based from a consumer standpoint as well as a daypart standpoint. So it is a unique new menu items to add to the variety of our proteins. It's our first seafood item and excited at its potential. And if things continue to progress on the current track, as we noted, and -- as I noted in the prepared remarks, we expect to launch it in late spring in 2026.

Our next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird.

David Tarantino
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Brett, I had a question about the operations. So I know you made a change in leadership there during the third quarter. And I was wondering if you could just address that change and why that happened? And then I guess you mentioned also tonight doubling down on guest experience and operations. So wondering if you could elaborate on whether you're addressing specific issues or whether that's more of an opportunistic statement as you think about where the business is today?

Brett Schulman
Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director

Yes, David, over the course of our 15-year journey, one of the things that's been instrumental in leading to our success is always being proactive and staying in front of the business and making sure we're bringing on the capabilities that we need for the next chapter of our journey and where we're going, not just where we've been and where we are. And so that true transition was in that spirit. And as it relates to the operational opportunities, this is the most intense discount environment since the Great Recession.

And our value proposition, we believe, is much more holistic than a price point. And one of the best things that we can do is deliver exceptional guest experiences. That's foundational to driving traffic over the long term and driving a competitive advantage in concert with our unique differentiated Mediterranean cuisine. And so we're just doubling down on that. It's been core to who we are throughout our journey, and we want to make sure that we're putting our best foot forward in a time when consumers are becoming increasingly discerning about where they're spending their dollars and that we also have the breadth and depth of pipeline to continue to support the new restaurant openings that are opening at record levels and opening them with operational integrity.

Our next question comes from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.

Eric Gonzalez
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

You talked about having a strong pipeline of traffic-driving initiatives for the next year. Maybe you could expand on that a bit. It sounds like you've got at least one protein on deck with salmon in the spring, but I'm curious if you have anything else exciting to call out so maybe pita chips size, beverages or desserts that might be interesting and worth noting.

Brett Schulman
Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thanks for the question. I think the pita chip piece would certainly be relevant next year sooner than beverages and desserts. Those are definitely category opportunities for us over the long term, but our pita chip platform for innovation has been very successful, and we continue to see opportunities to excite guests through that platform as well as the salmon launch, and then we will be expanding our catering test later in '26 to a second market. We're currently testing catering in Houston. I wouldn't expect the chain-wide launch, but later in '26, we plan to expand it to a second market in concert with Houston to continue to test and learn and position ourselves for a broader launch.

And then lastly, I'd say, on the marketing front, we have been very efficient and lean in our marketing spend over time, and we continue to test and learn and understand how we can show up in those channels effectively, especially as we communicate our value proposition and our message in a heavily discounting environment. And so next year, whether through collaborations or some of the other marketing partnerships that we have opportunities to forge, that's another area that we have not -- or another lever that we haven't pulled in a meaningful way to date.

Our next question comes from Andrew Charles with TD Cowen.

Andrew Charles
TD Cowen, Research Division

Brett, I appreciate all the context for the upcoming drivers. Two in particular, just in the current backdrop, the opportunities to accelerate investments in the near term and marketing, are there opportunities with the growing scale of the brand to really just create more brand awareness, now you've seen some nice gains last year as well as improving speed of service. And I would be very curious to know what the clearest action items are going to be for the incoming COO?

Brett Schulman
Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director

Yes. Certainly, speed of service, we've noted in the past, we know it's an opportunity. We're mindful of striking the right balance where we're not rushing people through the line too fast when it's their first time experiencing Mediterranean food or their first time interacting with CAVA let alone eating Mediterranean food. But we see clear opportunities to continue to improve on that front. There will always be operational opportunities. We hold ourselves to a high standard. And we want to make sure that we're delivering CAVA hospitality to the level and degree that we aspire to across every restaurant and having that speed of service consistently across the country.

So we think there's opportunities there. And then on the marketing front, as we gain scale in these markets, we'll continue to test more upper funnel activity that we have the ability to amortize and leverage it across a wider restaurant base. But from a new COO perspective, it's continuing to deepen and broaden out the people development pipeline. I noted we talked about the AGM role. That's in that spirit of not only helping give a stronger management complement across all shifts during the week across all 7 days, but also having more role-ready leaders in place.

Again, being proactive, staying in front and thinking about what do we need to put in place for just -- not for today but for tomorrow to make sure that as we scale to 1,000 restaurants by 2032, that all those things are already in place at that time, and we will be working on other things as we go beyond that milestone goal. So the focus will be on the people development side as well as continuing to elevate our speed of service without having people feel to rush through that line.

Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.

Sharon Zackfia
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Brett, you mentioned younger guests kind of in the prepared comments, and I don't know if that was a broader statement of the industry or if you're seeing something in particular with younger cohorts. And I'm also interested in kind of what you're learning about how you can lean into loyalty just given kind of this more volatile consumer climate.

Brett Schulman
Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director

Yes, Sharon, really, for us, we're a bit idiosyncratic in that our costs accelerated in the back half of last year when many industry comps were decelerating. So we're lapping tougher hurdles when most are having easier compares. So we don't want to overstate the challenges of the consumer, but you can look at the data. They're clearly out there, whether it's student loan repayment, consumer sentiment, just the inflationary pressures all around them, whether it's health care cost, housing costs, right? Gen Z unemployment twice the national average. When we look at the data, it's more that the younger cohort that 25 to 35 that Tricia noted in comments is that they don't have the steam that they had last year in the way that they were visiting or their frequency of visiting.

It's not necessarily they're so challenged with us. It's just that they don't have the vigor or the frequency of occasions that they did last year. And that's why it's incumbent upon us to continue to double down on our experience and our value proposition and make sure we're communicating that effectively. We're not oblivious to the commentary about the $20 launch. Well, the reality is you can get a chicken fillet at CAVA with all the toppings included, three different spreads, greens and grains for $10.65 to our highest price of $12.95 in New York City. So that's a sub-$13 bowl in the most expensive market, not a $20 lunch. And that's an opportunity for us to continue to communicate that, but it's fresh food. It's not freeze on a fryer food or ultra processed food. And when you step back and you look at the 2-year comp of 20%, and you look at the almost 67% revenue growth on a 2-year basis, we continue to gain significant market share.

And again, I know the Technomic data. It's very interesting. The industry has lost 7% in transactions since 2019. We've grown transactions in the mid-20s since 2019. We've taken half the price of industry peers food away from 34%, we've taken in aggregate, less than 17% in price. So we are focused on the long term. We say it's a marathon, not a sprint. And we want to continue and enhance our value proposition each and every year make our food more accessible to guests.

Now on the loyalty front, we are very excited about what we've seen in our loyalty program. We noted we've seen an increase of 36% in members in our loyalty program. We added this new tier status. And we've seen the ability to really create greater value for our guests and influence behavior in a positive way for their visits and for the business and expose them to new items. So for example, on chicken shawarma, on our loyalty pool, people who have tried chicken shawarma are coming more frequently than users who have not tried it. So the ability to have that one-to-one line of communication drive that innovation, drive that newness, drive excitement, drive trial is a powerful first-party data tool that we look to continue to leverage in the coming quarters.

Our next question comes from Jacob Aiken-Phillips with Melius Research.

Jacob Aiken-Phillips
Melius Research LLC

I just wanted to ask again on the honeymoon dynamic. So the last quarter, you described -- at least some of it as coming from maybe people driving further distance or just initial trial and new trade areas. But is that dynamic like something that lasted longer than the 3 months, 6 months or the initial stores that were affecting you last period doing better on a year-over-year basis? Just trying to understand the dynamic a bit better.

Tricia Tolivar
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So we are seeing the initial stores impacted are doing better on a year-over-year basis. And in fact, in looking at the restaurants in 2024 that have been opened for a period of time beyond 18 periods or 18 months, we're seeing a return to positive same-restaurant sales. So we don't believe this is reflective of a structural challenge. We don't find it concentrate in a certain geography or in a certain format or type of restaurant. We're continuing to monitor and we'll give you updates as we move forward. But likely given the performance of our 2025 vintage, we'll likely see a similar pattern in 2026.

Our next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.

John Ivankoe
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Thank you for opening the unit in Brickell. It's absolutely beautiful Brett and team, so thank you for that. So the question -- I'm going to make a question out of this. So this is a market where we know there's going to be a lot of demand growth, but the buildings haven't been built yet a lot of them. There's absolutely a lot of supply growth in the market and there's a lot of markets that are kind of like that around the country. New York City certainly is one, and I think there's a number of others as well where the supply growth is pretty obvious, just see walking down the street or the see on the app or to see on various promotions, what have you.

So the question, Brett, we spent a lot of time talking on the demand side, but can you talk about kind of the effect of supply growth that you've kind of seen in various markets. Now I'm not asking you to is like, hey, are they going to last? It's just whether they've opened and maybe competed with you on the margin, and it's just something that we just kind of have to wait out as the market will inevitably settle?

Brett Schulman
Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director

Yes, John, thanks for the Brickell comment. It's a beautiful restaurant, super phenomenal. Excited to have more open. We just opened Aventura in South Florida. It's interesting. I feel like it's less supply intense than in our younger earlier days. If you remember, kind of 2013 to 2016, there were a lot of fast casual concepts emerging and fighting for real estate. So it's more challenging. I mean, I think real estate is easier for us to get. And then from a competition standpoint, look, the restaurant industry, as I noted, has transactions down 7% since 2019, which means it's a share shift gain, which means you've got to be a better competitive alternative to the 3 or 4 or however many restaurants around you and be differentiated.

And to us, that's our Mediterranean cuisine. This on-trend cuisine that is unique and that it meets the moment of a moderate consumers increasingly diverse pallet seeking bolder, more adventurous flavors while not wanting to sacrifice on health and wellness. And then delivering that, as I noted earlier, are doubling down on operational integrity with exceptional hospitality, not just average operations, exceptional hospitality, we have seen over our 15-year journey is a recipe for success. When we do that, and we do it consistently. These comps go up. It doesn't matter who opens next door to us. We continue to grow market share and that's what we're focused on.

Our next question comes from Chris O'Cull with Stifel.

Christopher O'Cull
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Brett, I was wondering if the company has done any work to assess the value perception among non-CAVA users in more mature markets. I'm just wondering what the perception of the brand might be and what's keeping them from visiting the restaurants?

Brett Schulman
Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director

Yes, our value perception is strong. We do biannual brand health surveys. Many of the analysts on this call have put out value surveys where, I don't want to play favorites or names, but there is a lot of good research that you all put out that is ranked us very strong in our value proposition, if not towards the top of the publicly traded industry set. So we see that corroborated, whether it's anecdotally, whether it's qualitative or quantitative. We see our value proposition continue to be recognized by consumers, whether they come to CAVA or whether they're not as aware of CAVA, whether it's our internal studies or some of these third-party org analyst studies. So I think it's also a reflection of the way we think about value.

The relevance of our cuisine and measuring diet, the quality of the ingredients we're serving, the fresh food, fresh grilled proteins, fresh produce, not freeze to fryer or ultra process food, the convenience in which you can access it. And most importantly, at the end, I talk about the experience we deliver when you engage with the brand, and then you match that with the fact that over the long term, our long-term perspective and how we work every year to mitigate price less than 17% compared to 34% in industry aggregate average. We have underpriced inflation. We have underpriced peers that have enhanced that relative value proposition each and every year.

Our next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America.

Sara Senatore
BofA Securities, Research Division

I wanted to ask about -- you mentioned technology and KDS, and you'll be rolling out more broadly. What are you seeing in terms of, again, perception -- consumer perception? Are you seeing increased frequency or speed of service that's translating into higher frequency. I know experience matters a lot, but sometimes it can be hard to detect throughput when demand slows. So just as I think about technology as a potential driver, any kind of reads on what that means for throughput and guest frequency?

Brett Schulman
Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director

Yes, certainly, Sara, on the off-premise channels, whether it's delivery, third-party delivery or native delivery or digital order pickup, technology plays a key role. The integrations, the time our times on the third-party marketplace, how quickly we can get our food to consumers, making sure those integrations are aligned and then the team has the labor deployment and set up, so we can open our throttles. We manage, we build our own digital order platform. So we can control those throttles and we can open up those throttles as the team enhances and improves their productivity to deliver greater throughput and then the new kitchen display screen system really help improve order accuracy. We know it's our single biggest opportunity area for customer experience is making sure every digital order is accurate and that it has ample amount of food in the bowl.

And that is something that the kitchen display screen system has really been a tool to help improve that and help ease of production for our operators and help deliver greater accuracy for guests. And we see that voice of the guest score improve, and we see comps follow that. Like that has been true in -- since our very earliest days, whether it's the digital order line or the in-restaurant line, when the customer experience scores improve, the comps follow. And so we want to continue to make sure we're putting our best foot forward in that light and then using technology to enhance the human experience, not replace it. You take some of that complexity out of our team members' mind share or equip them with the tools and capabilities to deliver that exceptional guest experience. Even another thing, just having that order status update notification and making sure the algorithm is updating our guests if we're running a little late or if we're running a few minutes early, so that they're walking in ideally when their goal is being put on the shelf or at the window and one of our pickup by card locations.

Our next question comes from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein.

Danilo Gargiulo
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Brett, when you talk about hospitalities, you seem to suggest a broader opportunity than speed of service alone. So what do you think operations are falling short of your expectations relative to where you are going, not necessarily where you have been and where you are today? And what are some of the specific levers that you expect in the new CEO to deploy? And if I may, Tricia, you're expecting some of these investment in people to maybe translating into similar restaurant level margins compared to today? Or with sales leverage, should we still expect a growing restaurant level margin under the new operations?

Brett Schulman
Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thanks, Danilo. We have strong restaurant operations today. We have always been in a forward-looking posture, and we have aspirations to be thought of in an elite group of restaurant operators delivering exceptional service, not just average service, not just good service, exceptional service because it is like all my co-founders, sons of Greek immigrants, when you go to that part of the world, the hospitality, you feel the welcoming nature you feel. We want you to feel that every time you walk into every restaurant, no matter how big we get. And so that is our aspiration, and that is the work we are committed to every day to elevate to that level. And we have it in restaurants.

We have opportunities in other restaurants. And I think in moments where there's cyclical pressures on the consumer, it matters more than ever to make sure that it's consistent across all restaurants and take good to great. And that is something that we think is just another opportunity to drive additional traffic and drive additional market share growth from the significant gains we've had in recent years.

Tricia Tolivar
Chief Financial Officer

What that means from the restaurant level margin standpoint and how we're thinking about it. It's certainly a same-restaurant sales increase, restaurant-level margins will expand. But we're also very mindful of where we are in our journey and the investments that we think are necessary to put back in the business to make sure we're continuing to build a long-term durable brand that's going to consistently deliver on that guest experience and hospitality that Brett talked about.

Brett Schulman
Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director

Yes, if we see opportunities to invest further in labor, we will. It's just a belief that -- a philosophical belief we have that has gotten us to where we are today that we are going to continue to look at opportunities to make sure that any restaurant level margin expansion is sustainable and durable over the long term. And in the short term, that might mean targeted investments, if that's what we think is the right thing to do for the business.

Our next question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS.

Dennis Geiger
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Just another one on the newer stores and the performance in year 2, if I could. Tricia, specifically, you gave some good color a couple of minutes ago, I think, and I want to make sure I heard it right. Just as far as you're still seeing those new stores enter the base, I assume as a negative, just like last quarter, but that 24 class, those stores open 18 months, they're flipping to positive. I assume not as strong as what you've seen in prior classes, but positive after 18 months. So just wanted to confirm that. And the question really is if -- as you look ahead, any better sense on what '26 may look like with this new store dynamic as you've now seen a couple of quarters of the Honeymoon dynamic and other levers maybe you can pull to sort of maintain that growth even after big year one opens?

Tricia Tolivar
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, I appreciate it, Dan. So you heard it right, we're seeing the trends as you articulated them. And certainly, there are restaurants that perform above those expectations. So we're not -- but in general, yes, that is correct. And then in '26, we believe the '25 cohort of restaurants will perform similarly to what we saw with the '24 cohort in 2025. And things to do to try to make sure that we can open these restaurants as successfully as possible and capture as much of the honeymoon halo as we can is really taking our general managers and exposing them to high volumes as well and bringing them into other markets like New York to experience what these peaks are like, which is atypical and something that we hadn't experienced prior to this year, so that they're better able to manage the demand and then maintain more of those consumers as we go forward.

Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.

Jeffrey Bernstein
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Just looking at the most recent third quarter results. I'm just curious how much of the comp shortfall maybe versus your internal expectation heading into 3Q, do you attribute to the escalating macro headwinds versus perhaps some internal missteps or challenges and kind of thinking about as you look back, anything you would do differently if the challenging environment persists as we look into 2026?

Tricia Tolivar
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, the macro environment is certainly what put pressure on the results in Q3. I wouldn't -- there isn't anything that's structural about the business or any missteps that are significant that we would have adjusted for which we have done differently. It's really about how we look at how we performed in light of the 2-year stack that we were facing. So when you're coming up on a comp in the quarter last year of 18%, coming out just under 2% is not an unreasonable expectation, given that tough compare and the macro environment that we're in. We talked about 2-year stack and how they accelerated. And the 3-year stack at the beginning of the year, we thought would be in the mid-30s and we're just under that at 34%. And in this type of environment, that was not unexpected.

Brett Schulman
Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director

And again, Jeffrey, when we're in this heavy discounting environment, we're not going to get into that heavy discounting to combat any cyclical headwinds. That's why we talked about doubling down on exceptional operations and great guest experiences. That's where restaurant traffic starts. And that's always an opportunity for us and always will be, but it's incumbent upon us in these more challenging macro environments to double down on it because we're not fast food. We're not QSR. That's not our value proposition to our guests. Our value proposition as I spoke to before, the quality of our food, the relevance of the cuisine, the experience you get when you engage with us and you come into our dining rooms and you order on our digital channels and the accuracy we deliver. So we want to make sure we're doing everything we had in that spirit to deliver for our guests in this time when they're feeling pressures all around you.

Your next question comes from Jon Tower with Citigroup.

Jon Tower
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Two, if I may. First, Brett, you've mentioned multiple times on the call, the brand's pricing versus CPI over time since 2019. So I guess my impression is that as we're looking at 2026, you guys are probably not going to do much by way of taking price for next year. And I'm just curious if that's the right assumption to make for the brand? And then my next question is just on the last year discussion and specifically the builds for 2026. To avoid maybe the same issue hitting the store base with respect to honeymoon. Are you guys doing anything specifically where you're opening the stores in 2026, such that 2027, you're not going to running into the same issues with Honeymoons or is that not even part of the discussion?

Tricia Tolivar
Chief Financial Officer

So I'll start with price. So you're right, Jon, as we think about it, we've always been very thoughtful. Brett talked about this earlier on not passing a significant price on to our guests, so we don't plan to do that in 2026. So our expectation is our price increase will be very modest and less than what we did in 2025. And then as you're thinking about opening new restaurants in 2026, there's not a significant change contemplated and how we're opening them, just being thoughtful around what that means to the business and keep in mind our comp trends in Q1 of 2025 with a strong comp at 10.8%.

That will factor in the cadence of comps next year. But when we look at our real estate strategy, just wanting to make sure that we're being balanced and thoughtful in how we're bringing new restaurants in, particularly in new markets and how we're pacing those openings to perhaps try to balance out that honeymoon phenomenon that we've been experiencing. But I'll tell you, we're seeing it all over. So it's not just in new markets. We're just -- the brand is resonating very well and driving strong demand that's bringing many more guests than we originally expected, which drives a stronger cash on cash return sooner, which is great for the business overall.

Our next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.

Brian Harbour
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

The change to store margin guidance is that really just reflective of the sales environment? Or is there anything that's different about inflation, anything that we should factor in as we go to '26. And then I guess just also what's pressuring preopening expense?

Tricia Tolivar
Chief Financial Officer

When we look at restaurant level margin, it really reflects the experience we had in Q3. And frankly, in the quarter itself, we have continued to have higher repair and maintenance expense than what we were anticipating. We have been talking to everyone and seeing that over the past year and had thought that it would come down a little bit. And so what the guidance reflects is the actual results in Q3 and a continuation of that from another operating expense perspective into Q4 as we identify opportunities to look at those repair and maintenance expenses and optimize them.

So being more thoughtful around equipment and how do we make adjustments, but wanting to maintain the integrity in the physical spaces and making sure we're providing a great guest experience at the same time. There isn't anything significant around input costs or labor costs. It's more of that under operating expense line.

And then when you talked about preopening costs, what we're planning with preopening is they were in the quarter itself. There were many more restaurants under construction than what was in the prior year. But overall, we are seeing an increase in preopening costs per restaurant driven by a number of factors, and it's largely due to us investing in a better opening experience. So when I mentioned earlier, taking general managers out of the market where the restaurant is going to open and bring them into higher volume markets, that has extra costs associated with it, which we think is important to make investment in, so the general managers are better prepared and there's a better guest experience overall.

Operator

Our next question comes from Logan Reich with RBC Capital Markets.

Logan Reich
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Just on the Q4 comp, I recognize you guys gave the full year guide. It implies a relatively wide range on Q4. So just any sort of directional commentary you could provide on Q4 same-store sales outlook.

Tricia Tolivar
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So certainly, given the higher laps going up against the 21.2% same-restaurant sales in the prior year, coupled with the consumer headwinds, we wanted to take a very judicious approach in setting guidance, and it's been a bit choppy. And so what we're seeing today is a bit better than the midpoint of the range, but we wanted to be thoughtful and create a wide range because of the uncertainty that being faced with consumers today. And so how long will the shutdown continue? And what will that mean? And it's certainly a factor of one that's difficult to predict.

Operator

Our next question comes from Nick Setyan with Mizuho.

Nick Setyan

Historically, you've talked about the diversity of your COGS basket has been a little bit of a moat that allows you to under price inflation. What beef now in the equation, would you mind just updating us in terms of the composition of the COGS basket? And then two, just on the AGM investment, should we think about that as an incremental cost in labor in 2026? Any comment there would be helpful.

Tricia Tolivar
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So on the diversity of the cost basket, there isn't a material change in that mix overall. So 25% typically in proteins, 25% produce, 25% grocery and 25% everything else. So adding beef has not changed it materially in the overall cost from an input cost standpoint. And then when we're looking at AGMs, I appreciate you bringing that up. We've reimagined as the General Manager and training role and elevated it for those who are ready to an assistant general manager role. So it's not an incremental head count per se, but it is at a higher overall compensation rates. And so there'll be some modest impact to overall labor as we go into 2026.

Our next question comes from Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James.

Brian Vaccaro
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Most of mine have been asked, but I thought I'd follow up on recent trends. And just given your footprint in the DMV market, I'm curious if you're seeing any outsized softness in that region during the government shutdown or more broadly to what degree you think that could be having an impact on your business?

Brett Schulman
Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director

Yes, Brian, we did not initially see any impact. And in the most recent weeks as paycheck at going out to government workers, we have seen some softness creep in, but I wouldn't say it's acute or anything severe at this point.

Operator

That appears to be our last question. I will now turn the conference back to Brett Schulman, Co-Founder and CEO, for any additional remarks.

Brett Schulman
Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director

Thanks for joining us today. Before we wrap, I want to take a moment to share my gratitude for our entire team. Last month, I spent time in the field visiting our restaurants in the Midwest and Southeast. Seeing the energy of our teams, the pride they take in delivering great food and hospitality and the excitement of our guests is a powerful reminder of what fuels our success. This fall has been a period of continued growth, welcoming new guests, strengthening our operations and investing in the people who bring our mission to life every day.

As we head to another holiday season, we're grateful for the dedication of our team members and the loyalty of our guests. We remain energized by the opportunities ahead. Thank you for your time and support. We look forward to connecting again in the new year.
