[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.

Obviously, outstanding growth in Europe and Asia Pacific, especially Asia Pacific and Japan there. As we think about that growth here that's happening, I guess, can you talk about perhaps how much of it is market growth versus your ability to take market share? And then second, how sustainable are some of these growth rates that we're seeing going forward?

Patrick Zammit
CEO, President & Director

Okay. So in APJ, we -- for sure, we've experienced very nice high double-digit growth -- as you know, our share in the region is relatively low. So we are investing significantly in the region to gain share and grow our market. So when you look at the results, for sure, we gained significant share. We are also positioned in countries, especially India, where, as you know, the growth of the market is significantly above the average of the region. And the team is focused on product segments, vendors and customer segments, which should make the growth sustainable for the long run. So very, very pleased, very proud of the team and very confident for the future.

The only thing I would add is that it's not only the growth in sales, we are also experiencing an overproportional growth in operating income in the region as the team is investing, but also keeping a good cost discipline.

Keith Housum
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

Great. And how about for Europe? Because Europe obviously was better than we would expect considering the macro conditions we have there.

Patrick Zammit
CEO, President & Director

So just -- so we got some market data. Europe, the European market grew, let's say, mid-single digit, so slightly better even than North America. But for sure, we had outstanding performance. We continue to gain significant share in the region. We have a strategy which is very well executed. Again, we are going after technologies, vendors and customer segments where we can enjoy higher growth than the market, and that's what you are seeing in the results.

Your next question comes from the line of Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America.

Ruplu Bhattacharya
BofA Securities, Research Division

Patrick, you reported strong 15% growth in billings for 4Q and are guiding 12% billings growth for 1Q. How are you handicapping any end market destruction -- demand destruction from higher component costs like DRAM and NAND? And one for David. Can you just update us on the CapEx spend for this year as well as any investments planned for Hyve for 2026?

Patrick Zammit
CEO, President & Director

Yes. So thanks a lot for the question. So again, the guidance for Q1 reflects what we see from the regions, from the BUs. So I can confirm that the memory price have increased dramatically. And what we are seeing already is an increase in ASP on a series of product families, especially PCs, servers, storage. So the ASP increase is, on one hand, a tailwind in the short term. What will be interesting to see is what will be the impact on the volume going forward. But again, specifically for Q1, the guidance reflects the result of the bottom-up exercise with the regions and the forecast is done by technology, by country. So...

David Jordan
CFO & EVP

And Ruplu, the only thing I would add is when you think about total CapEx for TD SYNNEX, we're probably planning for a similar level of CapEx in '26 relative to '25, and that would include the investments needed to support Hyve's continued growth.

Ruplu Bhattacharya
BofA Securities, Research Division

Can I just clarify, have you actually seen any demand destruction from higher component costs? Or -- and is that factored into your guidance?

Patrick Zammit
CEO, President & Director

So specifically, I haven't seen it. And again, what is reflected in the guidance is the outcome of our bottom-up exercise.

Your next question comes from the line of Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.

Erik Woodring
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Patrick, I'm going to stay on the same line of questioning there is Ruplu, which is just can you maybe ask it a different way. Can you maybe help us understand what you're seeing in terms of any potential pull forward in either the November quarter or the January quarter just with customers wanting to get ahead of future pricing increases for any of those kind of memory-exposed products you just mentioned, PC, servers, storage, smartphones. And just how you might think more broadly, I know you're not guiding to fiscal '26, but just how you think that this dynamic could have an impact on either revenue or profitability seasonality for the year?

Patrick Zammit
CEO, President & Director

Okay. So -- so let me start with the brought forward. So it's difficult to assess, but I'm very pretty confident that we haven't had any, I would say, material brought forward in the last quarter. Now again, what's going -- so the Q1 guidance reflects what the countries are seeing in their region and again, for PCs, servers and storage. If I look at the overall year, so the tailwind for us is clearly the ASP increase, as you know, I mean, when the vendors increase their prices, we usually pass it through to the market. So no concerns on the margin quality.

On the demand tailwind related to the ASP increase. And then what's going to be interesting to watch is what will be the impact on the volume. And as you know, the elasticity will be different by product category. And probably the category which is going to be the most sensitive is PCs. But we have a very, very low position on consumer PCs. We primarily focus on commercial PC.

So I'm relatively confident that here, the elasticity should be relatively low. So I continue to be relatively optimistic about the prospects of the PC market. Let's not forget that the refresh is not over. There is -- I mean, it started a little bit later than expected. So we should continue to benefit from it, I mean, in the next quarter.

And then when you look at storage and server, I think here, again, the elasticity related to the price increase should be relatively low. So again, on the demand, I think the demand is going to be driven by other considerations, the need for customers to embrace AI, upgrade their servers. I mean there's a server refresh happening as we speak, and it's not over. So again, I think on the demand, relatively -- I should say, cautiously optimistic and then the ASP increase should help.

Your next question comes from the line of David Vogt with UBS.

David Vogt
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Maybe 1.5 for David. So David, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, free cash flow cumulatively for '25 and '26 is going to be consistent with the long-term framework of 95% of net income. Given kind of the mix of business going into fiscal '26, it sounds like netted down is going to be a bigger portion of that based on the guide, at least for Q1. Can you talk through kind of the mix of the revenue that drives that netted down effect? And then what sounds like a decline in free cash flow, even adjusting for the $200 million of payments in Q4 that was pulled forward in '26 versus '25?

David Jordan
CFO & EVP

Sure. David, when we -- in our prepared remarks, we said we expect cumulative free cash flow across '25 and '26 to be within the 95% conversion rate. Here's the way to think about it. Historically, our business consumes cash in the first half and generates cash in the second half. What you saw in Q4 is we had a really, really strong cash flow quarter. And so some of that will normalize as we go into Q1. And so we still feel really good about generating cash for the full year, but we do expect an outflow in Q1 that will ultimately be recouped as we work through the balance of the year. And it's not as much mix driven per se as it's just the additional cash that we generated in Q1 that will be normalized -- or sorry, that we generated in Q4 that will be normalized in Q1.

Your next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James.

Adam Tindle
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

I want to just acknowledge, Patrick, the strong return on capital, primarily great working capital management. But if I look at the margin side of things, it does look like some of that is being a little bit suppressed, and you talked about investments in Hyve. I wanted to ask about that. This has been an ongoing theme. I wonder if you could maybe just recap some of the prior investment decisions that you made in Hyve and the outcomes that lead you to invest further in Hyve, including any potential further new customers, for example? And for David, as we kind of look at this in the model, if you could maybe help us quantify or break out the investments in Hyve. Is it going to increase throughout the year? Are we sort of at the right run rate? What does this look like throughout fiscal '26?

David Jordan
CFO & EVP

So maybe I can start and Patrick, chime in. So in the prepared remarks, we talked about Hyve grew meaningfully both billings and profit. And so I wouldn't impute that there's a margin issue. In terms of investments in Hyve, we continue to invest in Hyve. And so Patrick talked about, we've invested in leadership. We've invested in the engineering team. We've invested in some additional capabilities within the sites. We have enough capacity to support our current demand, and we'll continue to make investments to ensure Hyve can truly be an end-to-end go-to-market player for Tier 1 hyperscalers and others. And so we feel very good about how the business is performing, the investments we've made and the prospects going forward.

Your next question comes from the line of David Paige with RBC Capital Markets.

David Paige Papadogonas
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Congrats on some really nice results here. Just a quick follow-up on Hyve, the 50% growth. Is that -- is that evenly split between ODM/CM or both the customers? Or maybe just a little bit more details around the growth there?

Patrick Zammit
CEO, President & Director

Yes. So we had -- so as you know, we have our ODM/CM business. That one grew very nicely in line, if not slightly better than the pace of the market. And then we had a very strong also quarter with, let's call it, supply chain [indiscernible] by division. As you know, this is a more lumpy opportunistic business as a service we render. So it's highly dependent on what the customers are asking for. And in Q4, we had a very strong quarter and better than expected. So that's how I would summarize the sales growth for the quarter for Hyve.

Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Cardoso with JPMorgan.

Joseph Cardoso
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Maybe another follow-up on the Hyve business. I just wanted to touch on like the progress that you're making with Hyve relative to capturing additional share with your existing large customers there and perhaps what you're seeing from a portfolio perspective or kind of the products that you're shipping there towards mix moving more towards AI servers, networking racks, storage racks and the opportunity to onboard potentially a new large customer beyond the two that you have today?

Patrick Zammit
CEO, President & Director

So again, I mean, we mentioned it in the prior calls, we continue to invest to expand the capabilities and capacity of Hyve. And so we are very active in bidding on new programs with our existing customers and potential new customers. I would say that thanks to the investments we've made, especially in engineering and some of the differentiators of Hyve in the market, I mean, we are seeing -- we are making very good progress on winning some new programs and potentially new customers.

Now I would say that those programs take some time to ramp. So again, when you look back at our Q1 guidance, it reflects what we have as forecast for the next quarter. But going forward, yes, I would say we continue to make good progress and are confident about the prospects.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of [ Austin Baker ] with Loop Capital.

Unknown Analyst

Just really quick, I guess, I would love to understand how margins -- you view margins for Hyve kind of going forward? Are they improving, normalizing as volume scales? And then lastly, how do you feel about the visibility for Hyve programs today versus maybe this time last year?

David Jordan
CFO & EVP

So I can take that one. We feel pretty good about the overall margin profile of TD SYNNEX. When you think about what we laid out at Investor Day was a couple of things. We want to grow operating profit faster than billings. And so we're constantly looking for ways, both within Hyve and within our distribution business to focus where we can make additional margin. And so again, we feel very good about that business. Patrick?

Patrick Zammit
CEO, President & Director

Yes, I would just add that when I look at the pipeline and I compare it to where we were last year, I think we are in a very healthy position. And again, that's what is reflected in our Q1 guidance.

Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Colicchio with Barrington Research.

Vincent Colicchio
Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division

Yes, Patrick, another good quarter on PCs. Just could you give us an update on your thinking in terms of what inning we're in here?

Patrick Zammit
CEO, President & Director

Yes. thanks a lot. Yes. So a solid again Q4 for PCs, broad-based, primarily driven from commercial. So going forward, as I mentioned, I think that the refresh is not over. So that tailwind should continue again in 2026. We have also the weight of AI PCs, we have a slightly higher ASP. That should continue to be -- so there's still a lot of potential for upgrading the PCs and make them AI compatible in the market. So that should be a tailwind. We talked about the memory price increase impacting the ASP of the PCs that should be, again, a tailwind. And then you have the uncertainty related to the price on the demand. But again, the fact that we are primarily focused on the commercial PCs, I mean, I think we are in a slightly better position than if we would have a high weight of consumer PCs.

So I would say for next year, I continue to be confident about the prospects of the PC market. And again, back to the guidance for Q1, I mean, the various assumptions have been taken into account and are reflected in the guidance.

Vincent Colicchio
Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division

And did AI PCs perform incrementally better this quarter?

Patrick Zammit
CEO, President & Director

Yes, it continues to -- the weight of AI PC continues to nicely increase. So that's a positive.

Your next question comes from the line of David Vogt with UBS.

David Vogt
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I just wanted to ask a follow-up, David, on the netted down impact, it looks like there's a big tick up in Q1. That's what I was trying to understand also. Is it mix driven? That's going to be a bigger headwind to your revenue conversion? Kind of can you talk about what's going on there from a netted down effect in the guide?

David Jordan
CFO & EVP

Yes. And sorry, I missed that part of your question. That's my fault. Gross to net increased in Q4, and we've got an increase into Q1. There's a couple of dynamics. One, strategic technologies continues to become a bigger portion of our business. A lot of that business is software, which, as you know, is netted. Additionally, within Hyve, there are a number of programs that are also net. And as the mix changes, that does influence that metric. And so if you think about how we set Q1, that's probably a realistic assumption of kind of the run rate gross to net that we expect for FY '26. Hopefully, that helps.

David Vogt
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And that would suggest that software and Hyve continues to grow as a portion of the overall billings pie. Is that a reasonable takeaway?

David Jordan
CFO & EVP

Exactly right. You're right.

Operator

There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Patrick for closing remarks.

Patrick Zammit
CEO, President & Director

Our strategy is designed to ensure that every step forward strengthens our business and supports greater long-term value creation. With our reach, our people, our unique capabilities and our momentum, we are confident in our ability to continue to succeed. Thank you, and have a great day.
