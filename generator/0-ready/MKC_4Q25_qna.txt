[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.

Andrew Lazar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Maybe to start, your '26 outlook is predicated on continued volume momentum. I was hoping you could talk a bit more about the key drivers underpinning your view. And in particular, maybe you can speak to expectations in consumer Americas, just given recent scanner trends have decelerated a bit. I'm assuming on elasticity, but perhaps you can clarify that.

Brendan Foley
President, CEO & Chairman

Sure. Well, a couple of thoughts just I think, in terms of top line. I think our guide for '26 reflects obviously, both segments and factors in, obviously, the uncertainty environment. But when we look at kind of the range that we're providing, I think, everyone, consumer drives sort of the mid- to high end of that range. And then Flavor Solutions is probably the low to the mid end of that range. Overall, we expect pricing to contribute more to our growth rate than it did in 2025, but we also expect to maintain volume growth for the year with volume growth in both segments.

I might just speak maybe to each segment just to give a little bit more color on that. On Consumer, we expect to continue delivering volume growth. It will have higher pricing, I think, compared to, let's say, the last year. We've driven volume over the last 1.5 years, and it has been driven by a lot of our actions and plans and a number of things that obviously we've talked about in the past.

And as I look to '26, a lot of those levers really remain in place. We'll continue to increase our A&P with really strong messaging that resonates. We'll continue to benefit from the innovation that we launched in '25. And those are things like the U.S. Cholula expansion or McCormick innovation like finishing salts or the type of innovation that we've launched in EMEA behind air fryer seasonings.

And I think one of the positive things, now it got launched in sort of towards the tail end of '25 and really started to hit the shelf, but this U.S. Gourmet relaunch, McCormick Gourmet we really think is driving a lot of positive velocities right now, and we like what we're seeing on shelf. And so that we'll get a full 3 quarters of the year on that innovation. And the whole price gap management plan also still remains in our base as it did in '25. Incremental to this, we're expanding distribution across our core categories. We'll continue to launch new innovation.

And we'll also continue to renovate parts of the portfolio. And one of the ones I'm also excited about is we're going to be relaunching our entire blends and seasonings line, and that's really quite exciting. So we like that, that's another renovation that's going to be coming out in '26. And then we're just going to continue to sort of focus on these high-growth channels that we're seeing a lot of success in. And so those are the things that are really driving, I think, an underpin and underwrite the consumer growth.

In Flavor Solutions, we expect to do better than we did in '25. We know '25 was impacted by large CPG customer volumes and being soft as well as in branded foodservice. But we do expect improvement, particularly as we continue to grow with those high-growth innovators and private label customers. We're acknowledging that we are lapping a difficult '25, so expect to do better. But it's difficult to predict the level and pace of that improvement. So I still expect some lumpiness in this business as we've experienced in the past.

But the things that give me, I think, more optimism, if you will, is just I'm encouraged by the scope of our innovation pipeline in that part of our business. It's really healthy across a lot of our customer segments. The reformulation projects are increasing, and we've talked about that before, particularly with large CPG customers. And we're partnering with a lot of emerging brands and private label players to sort of really work on flavor there. And it's an exciting categories like protein-based beverages or fiber-based snacks or these are the types of health and wellness trends that we're seeing getting a lot of activity that gives us some reason for optimism.

And our win rate on health and wellness briefs remains strong. So we have, I think, a realistically positive outlook. But we're also remembering what happened in '25 and not counting on all of that to sort of necessarily rebound back really strongly, but we do think it's going to be positive improvement over the year, and it will be volume growth in both segments.

Andrew Lazar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

That's really helpful. And then just a very quick one for Marcos. Just anything to keep in mind on sort of the cadence of EPS growth as we think through the 4 quarters ahead? Just things discrete to keep in mind, whether it's year-over-year issues or things of that nature.

Marcos Gabriel
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So in terms of the EPS, EPS should follow the operating profit over the quarter. So we'll see operating profit fluctuating over the next few quarters. OP growth will be in Q1 will not reflect the full quarter of McCormick de Mexico. So we'll be slightly below guidance. So if you think about it that way, earnings per share will follow that fluctuations of OP. And we should see a Q1 that will be in line, I would say, with mid- to high end of our guidance range, but then it will build up as we progress over the next few quarters.

Operator

The next question is from the line of Peter Galbo with Bank of America.

Peter Galbo
BofA Securities, Research Division

Marcos, I just -- I wanted to ask a bit on the gross margin, in particular, just given some of the nuance of what happened in the quarter, I think it came in obviously below even your expectations. You've talked a bit about the core inflation components maybe being stickier even though we've had some tariff relief and the outlook for '26 kind of implies gross margin expansion. I think you said recovery. I didn't know if that meant full recovery of '25 into '26. But maybe you can put some more parameters just around how you all are thinking about the gross margin expansion for '26 relative to '25, again, in light of kind of it coming in light of your expectations in the fourth quarter.

Marcos Gabriel
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Yes, sure. Let me just explain the 2025 Q4 results, and then I'll go into 2026. So at a high level, if you take a step back, the external environment continued to create the volatility in terms of our commodity costs. And we continue to focus on the elements within our control. We delivered CCI, enhanced CCI even to offset the additional tariffs impact that we saw in the year. We executed on pricing in line with our plans, and we continue to grow volume in the Consumer business in Q4 despite all the pricing actions that we've taken.

More specifically to the drivers of the gross margin, there's 2 main drivers. One is the indirect consequences of the tariff-related market pressures that we've been talking about over the last couple of quarters, and it actually accelerated in Q4 relative to Q3, which means that it was more than we expected, meaning that we saw more inflation coming through our P&L through the balance of the year.

And then the second point is the direct impact of tariffs, which is about recognizing more of those tariff inventory in our P&L than we originally planned. So we had -- it's a bit of the product mix in Q4 that had tariffs on it, and those got sold through it, and we saw the impact of that additional cost hitting our P&L in Q4. So the combination of the 2 elements is the broader commodity cost is impacting our gross margin plus the impact of tariffs were what changed versus our expectations as we came in Q4.

But also, I think it's important to mention, Peter, in this time of volatility, we are focused on managing the P&L holistically, not only the gross margin line. And that's where we drove a lot of SG&A savings. We had done a lot of -- made a lot of progress in terms of SG&A over the last few quarters. Q4 was also a quarter in which we focused on streamlining SG&A, while increasing investments to drive growth and marketing and digital investments. So managing the P&L holistically and getting to the OP number that was in line with our expectations, meaning SG&A offsetting the gross margin piece.

But obviously, the gross margin is something that we want to recover. Our expectations going into 2026 is that we are expecting to recover the margin compression that we saw of 60 basis points in 2025. And we provided a qualitative guidance in terms of gross margin as it is a bit difficult to be precise at this time. Given the uncertainty that we're facing in the market and the macroeconomics, it is a little bit difficult to be precise in terms of gross margin. So we provided that view. But at the end of the day, the focus will be in recovering the margin compression that we saw in 2025.

Peter Galbo
BofA Securities, Research Division

Great. Okay. And Brendan, maybe if I could ask just more directly on Slide 19, where you kind of have the bridge on base business to the guidance. The ERP, I know has kind of been discussed in the past now and maybe you put a more concrete number around it. But I want to make sure I understood you clearly that you're accelerating the spend or some of the projects into '26, but then those costs are actually expected to remain in the base, so we don't really expect maybe not even any relief on that in '27. Maybe you can just clarify specifically around the ERP and how we should think about the phasing of projects in '26 and then how to think about it for '27 and beyond.

Brendan Foley
President, CEO & Chairman

Sure, Peter. Peter, first, let me provide some -- just some broad perspective on sort of what we were communicating, I think, throughout the script, but also on Slide 19. And then I'll ask Marcos to speak more specifically to how to think about ERP beyond '26 overall.

Broadly, as we kind of thought about the year for 2026, our top priority was to really think about how we maintain sales momentum, that being a top priority in terms of having a very healthy top line. And we're balancing volume and price. And so -- and still achieving sort of healthy sales growth and still invest in the business also at the same time. But in 2025 and 2026, we certainly saw a lot more costs come into our P&L, whether it be through inflation or tariffs or in this case, as we go to '26, building back incentive compensation. And we're offsetting that with targeted pricing, productivity initiatives, cost savings initiatives, but we can't fully offset everything.

And so those are the elements that you see in that bridge, which were -- which are tax and ERP. But I would say that the fundamentals and the health of our business are doing really well. And we just need to work through this dynamic environment in terms of cost. Now in ERP, we decided that as this program is going well, and we are seeing success in a number of our go-lives already to date, as we assess sort of the next one, it just felt prudent for us to minimize the number of waves that we would have to go through.

Marcos, do you want to add on top of that?

Marcos Gabriel
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So we have been very successful in deploying our ERP implementation over the last couple of years. There's a lot of work, as you can imagine. We've taken a very integrated approach in terms of how we deploy the ERP, not only the ERP implementation team, but it is them working together with the business as well as the technology teams with strong support from our external partners. So that is going very well.

And these programs, you learn, you adapt and you evolve. And one of the things that we were considering over the last 3 to 4 months is really about the number of waves within the next deployment phase that we have, whether we would actually compress the waves to minimize risks. And that happens because as you shorten the periods between -- of dual operations between legacy systems and new systems, that minimize data reconciliation interface risks. So that is the key element of compressing the phases, which is you eliminate that interfaces between the 2 systems for a longer period of time.

So by doing that, we believe we are further minimizing risk. But as we do that, we bring forward the time line of development and preparedness into 2026 as this last go-live will take effect in early 2027. So as you do that, you shift costs into 2026, which is different than we had originally planned. Overall, costs for the program remain the same, but it's just a shift in timing of expenses between '27 and '26 due to this change in the approach that we're taking. In 2027, we should see that cost moderating, and then we should see further moderation down into 2028.

Our next question is from the line of Tom Palmer with JPMorgan.

Thomas Palmer
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I wanted to follow up on Pete's question and clarify on the unexpected inflation you noted in the fourth quarter, really with implications as we think about '26. I think you typically carry more than a quarter's worth of inventory on your balance sheet, and you did give the guidance a month into the quarter.

So I'm trying to think through to what extent this added inflationary pressure that maybe had some impact in 4Q might be even more of a consideration as we start out 2026. And kind of in that context, any help on thinking through that mid-single-digit inflation and the cadence of it in the coming year?

Marcos Gabriel
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

So we -- Tom, thanks for the question. So we exited the year at mid-single-digit inflation. If you think about Q4 versus the prior year, it was the highest quarter of inflation that we saw coming into our P&L. And that is a combination of tariffs, but also commodity costs more broadly. As you know, we have a broad basket of commodities. We source from 80 countries, 17,000 ingredients. We have a broad basket, and we saw inflation in the core commodity piece, but also tariffs coming in as well as packaging. We saw packaging as well up in Q4.

So we are exiting at a high cost with a high cost base. As we go into 2026, despite the moderation of tariffs, we'll still see a middle -- mid-single-digit inflation hitting the P&L, and that's our expectations into 2026. It could improve, but if it does improve, we will be later in the year. Right now, we're estimating that it's going to continue to be at the same run rate of Q4 into 2026.

Thomas Palmer
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then on the Consumer segment, you noted the expectation for volume impact from price elasticity but recovery subsequently. What drives the outsized price elasticity in the first quarter? And is there anything maybe related to shipment timing when we think about 4Q that relates back to that?

Brendan Foley
President, CEO & Chairman

Sure. As we think about the consumer business and as we go into Q1 and then we think about the rest of the year, we do expect an impact from elasticities in the first quarter. And I think one of the things that underpins that assumption is really that we have some pricing that we put in place targeted in surgical in 2025, but we also have additional pricing to come on beginning in February, which is a reflection of this inflation that we've been referring to as well as the -- to some degree, partly offsetting tariffs.

And so we expect some of that elasticity impact to really hit more in Q1 overall. And I wouldn't be surprised if we see volumes either flat to slightly negative in Q1 as a result of that. However, we do expect to sort of then improve upon that as we go throughout the rest of the year. And that there's a transition period that we're going through right now in Q1 where we're seeing more pricing coming into the shelf just as you try to offset these costs. But then we also have other programs in order to sort of recognize the reduction in tariffs and everything else that really starts to kind of find its way to, I think, our consumption profile starting in Q2 and going through the rest of the year.

Our next question is from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein.

Alexia Howard
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

Can I just ask about the sort of -- you've talked about the confidence that you have in the long-term objectives. On paper, you have a number of tailwinds. You're very on trend with consumer dynamics, interest in health and wellness and cooking from scratch, et cetera. The tariffs seem to be easing, reformulation seems to be picking up. And yet, this seems -- I think we're now on year 5 where the earnings expectations are below your long-term algorithm.

So I'm just trying to sort of square that away and thinking about what you said at the Investor Day in September, I think, in 2024 about the outlook for 2028. When might we expect to get back on algorithm? And are those 2028 goals still realistic from here? And then I have a follow-up.

Brendan Foley
President, CEO & Chairman

Sure. Well, Alexia, let me address the first one then, and thank you for the question. If you reflect back on the targets that we shared at Investor Day, that reflected, obviously, as we called out then, our organic growth ambitions. And many of those targets were established before the onset of much of this uncertainty that we've been seeing from a global trade standpoint over the last, let's say, year. And also, it was established before our acquisition of McCormick de Mexico.

Given everything that's kind of continued to sort of develop since Investor Day, we are aligning our commentary to the long-term objectives, which include organic growth and also accretive M&A. And I think from a sales standpoint, we really feel pretty good about being able to hit those targets by 2028 from a top line perspective. But we're also working very hard right now to offset the impact of what has been substantial incremental costs coming into our P&L over the course of 2025 and also as we look ahead to '26. And so a lot of our focus right now is on additional efforts to address these as quickly as we can.

And then our plan at CAGNY is to provide more color on how we look at the entire set of targets that we laid out to make sure that we have illustrated sort of any adjustments in our pathway with regard to those targets set out at Investor Day. I'd just come back to from a top line perspective, we feel really quite good and quite confident of our ability to hit those. But we got to work through right now on a short-term basis, just really the amount of incremental cost activity that we're seeing in our P&L. And we have to -- we'll provide you more perspective on how we look at that at CAGNY.

Alexia Howard
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

Great. And a quick follow-up. On the reformulation activity, you've talked, I think, for much of the last year about how that's picking up, particularly with private label and with some of your larger CPG clients. Are you still in an investment phase on that? Because obviously, you have to go through the process of actually figuring out how the innovation -- the reformulation will work before you really get that revenue stream in the door once the product is launched. Is that expected to sort of pick up through the course of 2026?

Brendan Foley
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. If I think I understand the context of your question, Alexia, and let me know if I didn't get it right. It's about -- from a development perspective, how are we looking at reformulation activity in '26. But also, I think maybe your question also had to do with as you think about the commercialization of that development, how might we think about that in '26.

So if I look at sort of both ends of that question, from a development perspective, I do expect the development activity to continue to pick up. We've definitely seen that as we went through the course, especially the back half of '25, and we expect to see more of that come through in '26. And it is a reasonably sort of, as we talked about before, a big tick up in our activity, and I expect that to continue to increase overall.

From a commercialization perspective, sort of, i.e., when it hits the market, I think that's a bit more delayed. I think late '26 is probably an early indicator when we start to expect to see that, but definitely more in '27 would be my expectation, particularly as you think about maybe sort of large CPG customer type activity. At the same time, there's a lot of emerging brand activity going on, and they tend to move to shelf a little bit faster.

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen.

Robert Moskow
TD Cowen, Research Division

Brendan, I think Andrew Lazar asked about the Nielsen tracking data for Spices and Seasonings in the U.S. and some weakening sales growth, shares are down both on -- in our data, both in terms of volume and value in the last 12 weeks. And I was hoping you could be a little more specific as to whether that reflects what you're seeing or not and whether there's any implications as to what the sell-through was from your holiday shipments in fourth quarter?

Brendan Foley
President, CEO & Chairman

Sure. We had -- well, there's a number of different variables in your question. So I'm going to try and make sure I address them all, Rob. First of all, I'm going to maybe hit the last point first, which is if I think about overall, our inventory in the channel, meaning the comparison between our sales and our consumption in the fourth quarter, it is exactly -- it's really where we thought we think it should be. And we don't see any anomalies at this point that would make us think that we have to speak to any differences that are unusual as we think about sort of the seasonality of our business. So that component feels very much in line overall.

When I think about just overall the performance of the fourth quarter, we saw a really very good holiday performance, especially when you look at our business in the Americas. Specifically, we were certainly delivered very much on what we expect would happen, both from a price and a volume standpoint from a sales perspective. But as we think about consumption, we believe that we had reasonably good consumption performance. I will say that there was a period there -- so many things happen and change, obviously, in the news, but there was a period there where we saw broadly in the market a bit of a slowdown for probably a couple of weeks related to sort of the news regarding SNAP funding, et cetera. And there was a little bit of a contraction period that we saw there broadly in grocery in terms of total results. And so a little bit of a dip.

But then things started to come back as we got closer to the holiday season, and we saw consumers really kind of purchase more closely to the holiday, which is reflective of sort of that budget sort of control behavior or that value-seeking behavior. And so we saw certainly that type of profile, if you will, in the holiday consumption, et cetera. As we go into Q1, we still have to wait and see what that post-holiday consumption looks like in terms of do consumers kind of maintain that level or do they moderate a little bit after broadly what was a successful holiday season.

But also keep in mind that we expect some price elasticity impact in there, too, as we talked about. And we certainly see that coming through a little bit. The price elasticities are operating as expected. So that is nothing that has, at this point in time, leave us to think that we didn't really have a good handle on what that might be.

And as we go through Q1, as I mentioned on a previous question, we expect maybe a little bit more variability in terms of price elasticity impact because there is a little bit more pricing coming to shelf as we offset these costs that we're talking about. And we are taking a very targeted surgical approach in our pricing. I mentioned a lot of things there, but I think I'm trying to get at the spirit of your question. Let me know if I did not.

Robert Moskow
TD Cowen, Research Division

I think it's fine.

Our next question is from the line of Max Gumport with BNP Paribas.

Max Andrew Gumport
BNP Paribas, Research Division

First, just a housekeeping one on tariffs. So gross annualized tariff exposure has fallen from $140 million as of last quarter to $70 million today. You also said you expect to book $50 million of incremental tariffs in FY '26. So my simple reading would suggest that this means you expect to book $70 million [indiscernible] this would imply you only booked $20 million of gross tariffs in '25. However, I know last quarter, you said you expected to book $70 million of gross tariffs in '25. And it sounds like if anything, it came in higher than that number. So I was hoping you could just give us a bit of clarity and tell us what was the final gross and net tariff number that you booked in FY '25?

Marcos Gabriel
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Sure, Max. I appreciate this can create a bit of confusion giving so many numbers from last year into 2026. So let me try to clarify that. So in 2025, first, starting with our last call was a gross impact of $70 million, and we mitigated $50 million out of the $70 million last year to a net impact of $20 million in 2025. Going into 2026, the annualized number now is $70 million, coincidentally the same. As we have already absorbed $20 million in the base, the incremental gross year-on-year impact is $50 million. So that's our call, the $50 million.

And if you look on Slide 19, that is the 5% of incremental tariff impact that we're seeing now '26 versus '25, and we plan to offset most of it as we go into 2026 with the same strategy that we had before, supply chain savings, procurement initiatives as well as some surgical pricing that will take place next year.

Max Andrew Gumport
BNP Paribas, Research Division

Okay. It also looks like on that slide that you're referencing that you're offsetting all the tariffs. So if the net impact was $20 million in '25, it looks like the net impact was going to 0 in year-over-year terms in '26. Is that fair?

Marcos Gabriel
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

Yes, that's fair.

Max Andrew Gumport
BNP Paribas, Research Division

Okay. And then just actually one other housekeeping one. Just with regard to your response to Andrew on cadence for EPS throughout the year, it sounded like you were saying EPS cadence will follow operating profit cadence. And then I thought you said that operating profit starts off slightly below the guidance in 1Q because you don't have a full quarter of Mexico, which makes sense. And then it also sounded like you said that 1Q EPS is at the mid- to high end of the guidance range. So if that's true, why is that?

And then I think you said it even then builds further from there, which might you'd be towards the high end of guidance for the full year. So I'm assuming I misheard you that 1Q EPS is at the mid- to high end of guidance and maybe it's below to mid-end, but just hoping for more clarity there.

Marcos Gabriel
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

So yes. So it's a little bit of -- between OP and EPS. So OP will be soft because of the, Max, McCormick de Mexico not being included fully in the base. However, EPS will be at the mid- to high in Q1, and then it will normalize towards the range throughout the year, as we said. So it's a Q1, a bit of a different equation between OP and EPS, but then it gets more aligned to the OP flow between Q2 and Q4.

Our final question is from the line of Scott Marks with Jefferies.

Scott Marks
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I wanted to just ask a little bit just if we kind of take a step back and look around the world, I know you've made comments about some different regions today. Just wondering if you can share maybe a little bit more detail in terms of how you're thinking about different parts of the world. What is encouraging to you right now? Where do you see some challenges maybe? And just any thoughts you have on kind of growth profiles in '26 in some of the different regions?

Brendan Foley
President, CEO & Chairman

Certainly. And what I might do is not speak to the Americas first because it feels like we sort of tended to focus a little bit more on that and some of the questions that we got. I'll start with Asia Pacific. And in fact, Marcos and I were just in China 2 weeks ago. So we've been in the region, and we'll go back out to the region here in a couple of weeks. And my outlook on Asia overall is I'll focus a little bit more on China and then the rest of the -- that region.

When we look at '25, we got that gradual growth that we were projecting that we would get. And so we feel pretty good about sort of the performance broadly in China. And we still see continued gradual improvement in that marketplace as we look at 2026. The parts of our business that are performing well there are broadly -- we feel are going to continue throughout the year. We see strength in our retail grocery business there, certainly good trends driven by increased distribution and stronger marketing across that business.

We also see strength in the business that we have in the middle of China, which really focuses a lot on more Chinese cuisine in terms of foodservice and catering and a little bit on retail shelves. And that business has been strengthening as we take a look at going from '24 to '25 and then '25 to '26. And our QSR business there is also doing really well, and we see just a lot of strong consumption happening in that channel. The only part of that business that's been soft is really our foodservice business, which tends to serve the higher-end restaurants, more Western cuisine, and that's been soft just due to a lot of different conditions in that marketplace.

But overall, we expect China to be doing reasonably well in terms of slight gradual growth again in 2026. And in the rest of that region, we continue to see pretty good growth in Australia and in Southeast Asia. And we're still going to continue to build our plan for India, as we've talked about before.

If I look to EMEA, we continue to see like the U.S. and the Americas, continued strength in our consumer business. It will be volume growth with some pricing, and that's consistent with what we saw in 2025 and obviously led by continued sort of all the things that we talk about, stronger brand marketing, increased distribution. And also even in those high-growth channels like e-commerce, we see a lot of growth there right now overall in our EMEA consumer business.

When I look at Flavor Solutions there, I do feel like we're going to have a stronger year than we did in 2025 because we just feel like the stabilization of that QSR marketplace starts to really show a little bit more improvement. I'm not counting on a lot, but I am counting on it being better than 2025, and that gives us some optimism in terms of that part of our -- that segment in EMEA.

And then coming back to the Americas, we just feel again, a reasonable amount of optimism as you see in our guidance for sales, both on the consumer business and also Flavor Solutions for the reasons that I mentioned on an earlier question. I just don't want to repeat all that, obviously, because it would be redundant, but we feel some really strength there. And then lastly, I'll wrap it up with Latin America and obviously, our -- the McCormick de Mexico business, and we anticipate having a good year there, too, largely being driven by obviously that being the consumer segment.
