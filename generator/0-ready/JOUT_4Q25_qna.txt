Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Anthony Lebiedzinski from Sidoti.

Certainly great to see the strong year-over-year sales gain in the fourth quarter along with the gross margin improvements. So as we think about the fourth quarter revenue gain, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it was mostly volume driven. Just wondering if you have seen this momentum continue into early fiscal '26.

Helen Johnson-Leipold
Chairman & CEO

We were really excited about what happened in the third and fourth quarter. And we just -- every month, things grew and the markets looked better than they have. And we don't give too much forward-looking statements. But I would say, so far, at least it's just very early in the year, but there's -- the market momentum is continuing as far as we can see. But there's no -- we're not ready to say the market has turned the corner. This is our sell-in period, and time will tell, but the season -- hopefully, it will be a very good season. So right now, knock on wood, things look pretty good.

That's great to hear. Okay. So it sounds like you are seeing some green shoots, I guess. I know you've put in a lot of focus on product innovation, and I know you highlighted a few products that did very well for you. Just wondering about the pipeline coming up for '26. I know you don't want to share specifics given competitive reasons, but anything you can just talk at a high level as far as new product pipeline for next year?

Helen Johnson-Leipold
Chairman & CEO

Well, we did -- yes, in diving, we talked about our new buoyancy compensator. And we've still got momentum in fishing from the launches that we had this past year. And launches are over more than 1 year. So we feel good about the momentum. We're focused on building the pipeline across every business. And again, Jetboil had positive results for their innovation, and that will continue into this season. So innovation is our key priority, and we will always focus on that. And it's critical during the time when it's so competitive out there and consumers are a little bit price sensitive. It's all about innovation. So that is a key focus. And we feel good about that -- it's one of our key priorities.

Got you. Okay. And then as it relates to the tariffs, I know, Dave, you touched on this a little bit, but I think you guys did take some pricing actions a little bit in July, I think more so in October. If you could just comment on the extent of that and what's been the reception from the retail partners that you work with?

David Johnson
CFO & VP

Yes. We did take pricing where it made sense. We were very strategic about what we wanted to do there. And so far, it's been okay. I mean the retailers understand our trade partners understand it. It hasn't affected the business right now. And as Helen alluded to, we're preseason right now. So it will be up to the consumer when those [indiscernible] to the shelves and make their decisions. But so far, so good.

Anthony Lebiedzinski
Sidoti & Company, LLC

Okay. That's good to hear. And then with the work that you've done on improving your operational efficiencies and enhancing your manufacturing processes, is there a way you can perhaps put a number on that in terms of how much it helps your gross margin? And do you think there are more opportunities to further expand on that?

David Johnson
CFO & VP

Yes. I mean we felt really good about the progress we made this year, and it was over 1 point of gross margin that we drove to the bottom line through the efforts. And we've got a full portfolio of cost savings initiatives going into fiscal '26. So we're going to continue the efforts, it's across the board. And that will be critical, again, to help manage the tariff situation and help manage the competitive environment.

Anthony Lebiedzinski
Sidoti & Company, LLC

Got you. Got it. All right. And then I guess lastly for me, I know the tax rate was impacted by the deferred tax valuation. But just kind of going forward here, how do we think about the effective tax rate for fiscal '26?

David Johnson
CFO & VP

Yes. I mean with the reserve in place, we would expect the tax rate going forward to be normal in a more normal range. So mid- to high 20s, something like that. So yes, going forward, we would expect that.
