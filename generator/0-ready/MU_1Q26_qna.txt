Question-and-Answer Session

Satya Kumar
Corporate VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Operator, can you queue up the questions?

Operator

Yes, sir. And I show our first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.

Timothy Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Sanjay, I wanted to ask you about customer LTAs. I know we're hearing about D5 that's being bundled with HBM and in some cases, even NAND. So can you just talk about these LTAs? I know it sounds like these are stretching out through '26 and in some cases, even into '27. I've even heard of some stuff into '28. So can you talk about the nature of these LTAs? And then I had a follow-up as well.

Sanjay Mehrotra
CEO, President & Chairman

These are multiyear contracts that we are in discussions with several of our key customers. And these contracts, of course, involve DRAM as well as NAND. And with respect to terms, of course, these contracts that we are under discussions for are very different from prior LTAs. They have specific commitments in them and much stronger contract structure. And beyond that, I can't be giving you specifics at this point. Of course, in the future, if and when appropriate we'll be sharing further details.

Timothy Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And then, Mark, I wanted to ask you about CapEx. So you took it up to $20 billion net, but it still seems, I mean, you're not guiding all fiscal '26 revenue. So we don't really know what the capital intensity number is, but it seems like it's like 25% to 30%, which is a little below your 35% metric that you usually think of. So is that because you're constrained because of fab space? And can you just talk about does that sort of like roll into fiscal '27 where we would see CapEx up more near that 35% range?

Operator

And I show our next question in the queue comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald.

Christopher Muse
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

Yes, yes. They didn't answer the prior question. Operator?

Operator

Yes, sir.

Christopher Muse
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

Can you turn it back to management so they can answer the prior question?

Operator

Sure. Management's line is open, please proceed. I believe the speakers' lines are muted at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, please continue to stand by. Your call will resume momentarily.

Mark Murphy
Executive VP & CFO

Operator, can you hear us?

Operator

Yes, we can now. You are unmuted, sir. Please proceed.

Mark Murphy
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. Not sure what happened there. We were on mute here. So I just want to make sure that you heard Sanjay's response, correct?

Timothy Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

We did not.

Mark Murphy
Executive VP & CFO

You did not hear Sanjay's response? Okay. Thanks, Tim. So Sanjay...

Timothy Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

We heard, I heard Sanjay's response to the first question, but I didn't hear your response, Mark, to my question on CapEx and on capital intensive.

Mark Murphy
Executive VP & CFO

Okay, Tim. So you're right, Tim. We're not providing a full year revenue guide. We did indicate that our CapEx was going up in calendar -- in fiscal '26. Anyhow, a substantial part of that CapEx is to support DRAM and specifically HBM and the 1-gamma and 1-gamma ramp. I would say that from '25 to '26, the plan is roughly to double the brick-and-mortar construction CapEx and at this time, we would expect '27 CapEx to be up and -- but I want to emphasize that Micron is going to remain disciplined on CapEx growth to support bit demand and bit supply and that supply will be in line with demand.

As your question of capital intensity, our capital intensity, of course, is dropping as the market conditions remain very constructive. And of course, we are working to be very efficient with our capital spend.

Operator

And I show our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald.

Christopher Muse
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

I guess, Mark, to follow up on the prior question around CapEx and the relative growth seems very conservative in the backdrop that we're in. And it feels like that you're just sitting here without cleanroom space. And it also doesn't sound like you're meaningfully pulling in cleanroom. So can you talk about the philosophy there? And I guess what I'm taking away from your commentary is that you're being very conservative and judicious with adding capacity here.

Mark Murphy
Executive VP & CFO

Well, I would say that we've been indicating issues with supply for several quarters that we were working inventories down, that node transitions were going to be the principal source of supply growth in fiscal '26 and that's exactly what's happening. And we know that cleanroom space takes time and the HBM growth, which has only picked up with AI-driven demand has further pressured supply.

So there's no near-term solution. As we said in the prepared remarks, the entire industry, we expect to be short to demand and we're no different in that case. But we are moving quickly to do our best to provide customer supply. And we have pulled in tools. We have accelerated construction in Idaho. We are doing everything we can within our existing footprint and near-term capacity expansions to deliver supply. And so we provided a bit growth number for '26 and that is supply constrained.

Sanjay Mehrotra
CEO, President & Chairman

And I'll just add that, of course, we are continuing to make the investments in technology transitions in our existing footprint. And as we highlighted that 1-gamma node will be a majority driver of our supply growth in '26. And of course, you have seen us make investments not only in technology transitions, but also in greenfield capacity, but also enabling greater technology production capability in our existing cleanrooms in Japan, and we are making the necessary investments there as well.

So of course, we remain disciplined, but we are very much focused and trying to work hard towards increasing our supply there and pleased with our plans for Idaho 1, Idaho 2 and, of course, New York as well. And of course, in the short term, very much focused on maximizing production efficiencies, maximizing our production output from the existing footprint as well. But yes, I mean, demand fundamentals are pretty strong driven by AI, from data center to edge with the buildout of our customers and supply is significantly short. And I would say that in the medium term, we are only able to meet about 50% to 2/3 of our demand from several key customers. So we remain extremely focused on trying to increase the supply here and making the necessary investments.

Christopher Muse
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

Very helpful. And then I guess as a follow-up for gross margins. Obviously, the guide is quite stellar. But curious as you go through calendar '26, how should we think about cost down across both DRAM and NAND? And as you transition from 3E to 4, is there anything that we should keep in mind or we should think about it, contemplate in our models where there might be higher costs temporarily giving yields or whatnot?

Mark Murphy
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So our -- C.J., our cost execution has been very good across both DRAM and NAND. Of course, we're getting some volume leverage, but spend control has been very good. Yields have been good. We do have some start-up costs coming in for the new fabs, new construction across the network. That starts to come in second half of '26 and into '27. But at these -- the size of the business at these levels, it's a relatively small impact on margin. We're not going to provide cost guidance for the rest of the year as it depends on many factors, including mix. But to our earlier question, I can say that we talked about ramping 1-gamma DRAM and G9 NAND at length for supply in '26. And those ramps are proceeding well and will be a tailwind to our cost as these nodes ramp.

Sanjay Mehrotra
CEO, President & Chairman

And regarding your question on HBM3E and HBM4, as we have said, we'll be beginning to ramp production of HBM4 in CQ2 time frame in line with our customer demands. And of course, our HBM4 is progressing extremely well. Very pleased with our product, industry-leading product with the highest performance of over 11 gigabits per second. And so I mean that's the highest performance. And we are very pleased with its overall yield ramp, and we expect our HBM4 to be expecting -- having a faster yield ramp than our HBM3E. And of course, our mix of HBM3E and HBM4 during '26 will be very much based on our overall customer demand. And we will have both of these products with a strong profile in our '26 revenue.

Operator

Our next question in the queue comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.

Harlan Sur
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great job on the quarterly execution. Just over the past 3 to 4 months as we track the different ASIC AI XPU programs. There's been a significant upward revision on ASIC XPU volume shipments next year. You have Google TPU, AWS Trainium and so on, right? And all of these XPUs still going to be using HBM3E. Have you -- has the team seen this near-term positive dynamic in your order book for 3E? And given that you're fully contracted for calendar '26, like what -- and what appears to be growing upside to next year's view. How is the Micron team going to try and manage this upside dynamic in 3E alongside a strong HBM4 demand profile?

Sanjay Mehrotra
CEO, President & Chairman

So as I mentioned, Harlan, earlier that, of course, 2026, we'll have a mix of HBM3E and HBM4. And we have shared with you in the past that we are engaged with multiple customers with the entire ecosystem here of HBM customers and very much engaged with them, and they will all contribute to our strong year-over-year growth in revenue in '26. And of course, that will be made up of both HBM3E and HBM4. So as I said, I mean, we will continue to manage the mix of 2 based on customer requirements. I can tell you that 2026 supply on HBM will be tight, non-HBM DRAM will be tight as well. So we are continuing to see, as we have highlighted in our prepared remarks, tightening supply environment. And of course, we see strong year-over-year growth in '26 for our HBM. We today upped our revenue forecast for HBM. We highlighted that by 2028, we expect it to be $100 billion TAM, and that's 2 years ahead of our prior outlook.

So of course, HBM is on a good trajectory. And what I can also tell you is that customers as their architectures are evolving, as their platforms are evolving and these are customers across the ecosystem. Of course, they are requiring more and more HBM. I mean the value of memory in terms of ability to deliver the AI capabilities and the functionality and the performance, memory is critical and more HBM is required, and that's across the various AI platforms in the industry.

Harlan Sur
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I appreciate that, Sanjay. And then after 2 to 3 quarters of enterprise SSD sort of muted trends, I believe the team saw a strong acceleration in the business, right? According to some of the third-party research estimates, I think your enterprise SSD business grew like 25% sequentially in the most recent quarter, right? So you're the #3 market share leader amongst 8 or 9 competitors, right? Very strong share position. Given, I would assume, increasing demand trends here, expanding lead times, is the Micron team also entering into long-term supply agreements with your eSSD customers? And then secondarily, I mean, SSD demand, is it more tied to expansion in inferencing workloads as customers aggressively move to monetization? In other words, is storage intensity higher on inferencing versus training workloads?

Sanjay Mehrotra
CEO, President & Chairman

So with respect to enterprise SSDs, really very proud of our engineering and business teams and of course, our sales teams in terms of our customer engagement and the strong momentum and the share gains that we have with our enterprise SSD. Of course, our enterprise SSDs are a big part, an important part, let me say, of our data center strengthening mix. Of course, DRAM is continuing to increase in mix towards data center, but data center SSDs are an important part of our overall revenue mix. And we expect to continue to focus on share gains with our strong SSD road map, customer engagement and great quality that we provide to the customers.

And as I mentioned, that our multiyear contract that we are in discussions with, with our several key customers, our SSDs, our data center SSDs are also part of that. And let me tell you that these multiyear contracts are not just about data center customers. They also are about multiple customers across our market segments here.

And in terms of your questions on is the SSD requirement growing with inferencing versus training? What I can tell you is that in the data center AI applications, I mean, as the generative AI moves to more and more video, of course, that drives greater our demand for more SSDs as well. So I mean, the rapid evolution of AI from training to inferencing and a rapid evolution of AI models and applications, they are all driving greater growth of enterprise SSDs, yes, fueled by GenAI.

Operator

And I show our next question comes from the line of Tom O'Malley from Barclays.

Thomas O'Malley
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Sanjay, you've been helpful in the past about kind of talking about Micron's ramp in HBM and then also the ramp of the total market. You gave some new color on HBM with the $35 billion moving at a 40% CAGR. But Micron specifically, I was curious if you could give us any color on percentage of the DRAM business today that's HBM from a dollars perspective. And then on share as you move into next year, obviously, there's a large competitor that is looking to become more competitive at 3E. We haven't heard anything on 4 yet. How do you feel about your competitive positioning into next year? And do you think that you're going to make any strategic decisions differently based on the public certification of their memory in the next couple of months?

Sanjay Mehrotra
CEO, President & Chairman

We feel very good about our competitive position. We feel very, very good about our product and our HBM4 product that we have highlighted as industry-leading performance over 11 gigabit per second, the best specifications in the industry with our performance. And of course, we feel very good about the power consumption in our products as well. In the past, we have shared with you that how our HBM3E is 30% lower power than any of the competitors in the industry, and we are maintaining that momentum of low power, which you know in data center applications is very important.

So we are maintaining our performance in power and of course, our strong capacity position with HBM4 road map as well. So we feel very good about our competitive position, about our road map and our road map going beyond HBM4 for the future years, beyond '26 as well. And we are very proud of our team's ability to execute successfully over the course of last several quarters in terms of ramping up production capabilities of HBM3E and we shared with you that in CQ3, we reached our share of HBM3E to be in line with our -- I mean, our HBM share to be in line with our DRAM share. And we have always highlighted that as we have reached that share, we will, particularly in the tight supply environment, we'll be managing the mix of our HBM as well as our non-HBM, all of it is in high demand. And HBM as well as non-HBM has strong profitability.

So looking at our strategic customer relationships as well as our overall profitability goals and growth objectives, we'll continue to manage that mix between HBM and non-HBM, but of course, HBM is growing, and we have highlighted that how we expect the TAM to be $100 billion by 2028, a couple of years ahead of our prior projection. And of course, we will grow our HBM as well, 2026 will see a strong year-over-year growth in our HBM. And this is a tight supply environment, as I mentioned, that the gap between the demand and supply for all of DRAM, including HBM is really highest that we have ever seen, and I quantified it earlier as well. So in this environment, of course, working closely with our customers, we are continuing to manage our mix of the product here. As we focus on also continuing to increase supply to better address our customers' demand requirements.

Thomas O'Malley
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Perfect. And just as a follow-up, you've said historically kind of the $8 billion run rate. If you look at November and February, you're taking up the total TAM, but any color specifically on HBM contribution in the November quarter and what you're expecting in the guide?

Sanjay Mehrotra
CEO, President & Chairman

We are not really providing those specifics here in terms of the breakout. I mean we highlighted that in FQ1, our HBM revenue was a record, we did highlight that. And beyond that, we are really not going to be providing the specifics in terms of revenue. And just would tell you again that year-over-year in '26, we'll be seeing strong growth in our HBM revenue. And again, our product is very well positioned. So I mean, that's a very good place to be in, in terms of managing the overall mix of the business.

Operator

And I show our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Cowen.

Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan
TD Cowen, Research Division

Congrats on the phenomenal results and guidance. My first question is for Mark. I know you spoke about the sustainability for the next year. I'm kind of curious how to think about gross margins beyond the February quarter, like into May, is it going to improve or sustain at these levels? How to think about the gross margins? And I have follow-up for Sanjay.

Mark Murphy
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Krish. For -- we're not guiding margins beyond Q2. We did guide a record Q2, as you know, 68%, 11 points sequential improvement, 7 points better than the previous record. We did indicate that we would -- our business would strengthen through the year. And so we do believe margins can be up. We do believe that they will be up for DRAM and NAND. Now keep in mind that at these high gross margin levels, mathematically, we get less in gross margin percent for the same increase in price. So yes, we would expect gross margins to expand beyond fiscal Q2, but we would expect that growth to be more gradual than what we've seen in the last couple of quarters or the first quarter and the second quarter guide.

Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan
TD Cowen, Research Division

Got it. That's super helpful...

Mark Murphy
Executive VP & CFO

And Krish, just one last thing. We have indicated that strengthened through the year because we believe this constructive market environment will remain so through the year, these favorable market conditions. But we also -- we're executing very well on cost. And as Sanjay mentioned earlier, we're deploying the bits to the valuable part of the market and where we can serve our customers best.

Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan
TD Cowen, Research Division

Got it. Super helpful, Mark. And Sanjay, just as a follow-up to the earlier question. I understand you don't want to like put some boundary conditions, but a year ago, you totally nailed it when you said you're going to get like HBM market share close to your DRAM market share, the DDR market share. So when you talk about like a 2028 CAGR of 40%, $100 billion TAM, how do you think about Micron's HBM market share in that realm? Should we assume it's going to be the low 20%, that spectrum or is going to be lower?

Sanjay Mehrotra
CEO, President & Chairman

So Krish, again, we are not really going to be specifying the share. As we have said, we will be managing the mix of the business between HBM as well as our non-HBM. It's like any other product in our portfolio that when you have a strong product road map across the portfolio, then of course, we manage the mix across our portfolio with all the strategic reasons and customer relationships in mind. So Krish, we are not really going to break that down. And all I would say is that in this current industry environment, which we see as durable industry fundamentals in the foreseeable future. We are in a very good position with all the tailwinds of our product portfolio and, of course, the increasing value of memory across the board, of course, HBM, but also non-HBM in data center and other markets we will just remain very focused on managing the mix of our business and of course, managing for the best in the mid-term as well as keeping in mind the longer term.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely from Citi.

Christopher Danely
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

So I just want to dig in on these long-term customer contracts you guys are negotiating. Can you give us any more sense of when you think you'll be able to sign these and then maybe just talk about what the holdup is? Is it just the unprecedented length or size? And given that the AI companies are asking for so much of your capacity, are you able to get them to more or less contribute to the building of a new fab?

Sanjay Mehrotra
CEO, President & Chairman

So we will not really get into the specifics around our contract discussions with our customers. But again, I will highlight a couple of important factors that customers are concerned about long-term access to adequate memory in the environment that we are heading into. And that's leading to constructive dialogues with several key customers and across our multiple markets in terms of their supply as well as other important specific commitments related to our -- these longer-term agreements.

Not getting into the specifics, but as I highlighted, our contract structures that we are discussing are not like anything before. They are far stronger contract structures with specific commitments. And of course, different from prior contracts is that those used to be like 1-year contracts, and these are multiyear in nature as well. And as we look at addressing the customer discussions, of course, we have to look at our overall supply. And I have mentioned to you that in the mid-term, medium term, we are only able to meet half to 2/3 of the demand from our several key customers. So all of that, as we are managing our customer relationships and keeping our strategic objectives in mind, all of that has to be taken into account as we manage our contract discussions. But really not getting into the specifics here.

Christopher Danely
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

That's still very helpful, Sanjay. And for my follow-up, just a question on HBM and the pricing there. So given that the demand is so strong, I think you said you're sold out for '26. Are you guys locked in to a set price? Or can you let that price more or less float a little bit given how strong demand is like DDR5 does, for example?

Sanjay Mehrotra
CEO, President & Chairman

We are really pleased with our product position and our ability to work with our customers as we highlighted, in our prepared remarks that our HBM for 2026 is sold out in terms of volume and our negotiations with customers have been completed for calendar year 2026 for volume as well as pricing. And as we have always highlighted that our HBM has strong profitability. And of course, very much focused on ROI and our non-HBM business also clearly has healthy profitability as reflected in the results that we produced as well as in the guidance that we have provided here.

Christopher Danely
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Great. Congrats again on the results.

Sanjay Mehrotra
CEO, President & Chairman

Thank you.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities.

Vivek Arya
BofA Securities, Research Division

Sanjay, I'm curious, at what point does increasing memory price impact demand for electronics? If you set aside the data center and the AI market, do you see some elasticity? Do you see any impact on demand as you look into 2026 for more consumer and kind of traditional enterprise products? How does that shape where memory pricing can go next year?

Sanjay Mehrotra
CEO, President & Chairman

We have highlighted in our prepared remarks that in some of the consumer markets, I mean, some of the unit demand may get impacted, given semiconductor prices here, given memory prices here. And of course, some of the customers may have, for example, in smartphone and PCs, they may have some mix adjustments in their portfolio as well to address available supply to them. But these are accounted for in our forecast that we have. And so I mean, some of the possible impact on unit demand and some of the customer mix changes have been accounted for in our forecast. And we, of course, even then we see a very, very tight supply environment here in the large gap between the demand and supply.

However, I will highlight to you that AI experience across from data center to edge, including in these edge devices like smartphones and PCs and other devices, AI experience really more memory is essential. So without sufficient memory, that AI experience, the functionality, the capability does get impacted in these edge devices as well. So I mean the punchline here is that AI across the board from data center to edge is driving increase in content and increasing requirement for memory as the customers look ahead at their road maps. And that's why customers are, of course, working with us with respect to access to supply for their long-term multiyear plans here as well.

Operator

Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session and today's conference call. At this time, I would like to end today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now all disconnect.
