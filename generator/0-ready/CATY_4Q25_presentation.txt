CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Georgia, and good afternoon. This afternoon, we reported a net income of $90.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2025, a 16.5% increase from $77.7 million in Q3. Diluted earnings per share increased by 18.3% to $1.33 in Q4, up from $1.13 in Q3. For the full year 2025, our net income was $315.1 million, a 10.1% increase from net income of $286 million in 2024. In Q4, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock for $51.9 million at an average cost of $47.15 per share under our June 2025, $150 million stock buyback program.

There is $12 million remaining under our June 2025, $150 million buyback program, which we expect to complete in early February. We plan to announce a new buyback program after approvals are received. Total gross loans grew by $42 million, driven primarily by increases of $18 million in CRE loans and $17 million in residential loans. We expect loan growth in 2026 to be between 3.5% and 4.5%. Slide 7 of our earnings presentation shows the percentage of loans in each major loan portfolio are either at a fixed rate or hybrid rate. Aggregate fixed rate and hybrid loans account for 60% of the portfolio, excluding fixed to float interest rate swaps, which represent 3.1% of total loans.

Fixed rate loans make up 30% of total loans and hybrid in fixed rate period account for 30% of total loans. We expect these fixed rate loans to support our loan yields as market rates are expected to decline. We continue to monitor our CRE portfolio.

Turning to Slide 9. The average loan-to-value of our CRE loans remained steady at 49%. Our retail property loan portfolio represents 24% of our total CRE loan portfolio or 12% of total loans. As shown on Slide 10 of the $2.5 billion in retail property loans, 90% are secured by retail store, neighborhood, mixed use or strip centers, only 9% are secured by shopping centers.

Turning to Slide 11. Office private loans represent 13% of our total CRE loan portfolio or 7% of our total loans. Of the $1.4 billion in office loans, 30% secured by a pure office, only 3% are in central business districts. Another 42% are collateralized by office retail stores, office mixed use and medical office properties, with the remainder 28% secured by office condos. For Q4, we reported net charge-offs of $5.4 million as compared to $15.6 million in the prior quarter. Nonaccrual loans were 0.6% of total loans as of December 31, 2025, down $53.3 million to $112.4 million compared to the prior quarter. The decrease in nonaccrual loans during the fourth quarter of 2025 included the sale of a $15.8 million CRE loan at par and a $10.8 million CRE loan brought current and restored to accrual status.

Turning to Slide 13. Classified loans decreased from $420 million to $391 million for Q4. Special mention loans increased from $455 million to $535 million in Q4. The bank downgraded 5 loan relationships totaling $92 million to a special mention that have not met certain debt covenants and have exhibited short-term financial issues for closer tracking. The bank believes that these credits will resolve within the next 12 months by either credit upgrades or partial or full payoff. We recorded $17.2 million in provisions for credit losses in Q4 compared to $28.7 million in Q3. The ALLL to gross loan ratio increased to 0.97% from 0.93%. And excluding our residential loan portfolio, the total reserve to loan ratio would be 1.22%.

Total deposits increased by $373 million or 7.6% on a annualized basis during Q4, driven primarily by $366 million increases in core deposits and $7 million in time deposits. The growth in core deposits reflected seasonal factors in targeted marketing activities. For 2026, we expect deposit growth to range between 4% and 5%.

As of December 31, 2025, total uninsured deposits were $9.3 billion, net of $0.9 billion in collateralized deposits, representing 44.6% of total deposits. The bank has $7.5 billion of unused borrowing capacity from Federal Home Loan Bank, $1.3 billion from Federal Reserve Bank and $1.6 billion in unpledged securities. Altogether, these available liquidity sources provide more than 100% of the uninsured and uncollateralized deposits as of December 31, 2025.

I will now turn the floor over to our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Heng Chen, to discuss the quarterly financial results in more detail.

Heng Chen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Thank you, Chang, and good afternoon, everyone. For Q4 2025, net income increased $12.8 million or 16.5% to $90.5 million from $77.7 million for Q3, primarily due to $11.5 million lower in provision for credit losses, $5.4 million higher in net interest income and $6.8 million higher in noninterest income, partially offset by a $4 million increase in noninterest expenses and $6.8 million higher in provision for income taxes.

The net interest margin increased to 3.36% in Q4 from 3.31% in the prior quarter. The increase in net interest income was driven by a lower cost of funds. We anticipate further benefits to the NIM from declining deposit costs supported by the fixed rate proportion of our loan portfolio. Based on the Fed fund futures, we project 2 rate cuts in 2026, one in June and a second cut in September and anticipate that the net interest margin for 2026 to range between 3.4% and 3.5%. In Q4, interest recoveries and prepayment penalties added 5 basis points to the net interest margin compared to adding 4 basis points to the net interest margin in Q3.

Q4 noninterest income increased $6.8 million to $27.8 million compared to $21 million in Q3, mainly reflecting a $6.4 million change in mark-to-market unrealized gain on equity securities in Q4. Noninterest expense increased by $4.1 million from $88.1 million in Q3 to $92.2 million in Q4, primarily due to a $4.3 million higher bonus accrual in Q4 as a result of the above budget financial performance for 2025. We expect core noninterest expense, excluding tax credit and a core deposit intangible amortization to increase between 3.5% and 4.5% in 2026.

The effective tax rate for Q4 2025 was 20.33% as compared to 17.18% for Q3. We expect effective tax rate between 20.5% and 21.5% for 2026. As of December 31, 2025, our Tier 1 leverage capital ratio increased slightly to 10.91% as compared to 10.88% in Q3. Our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios increased to 13.27% from 13.15% in Q3 and our total risk-based capital ratio increased to 14.93% from 14.76% in Q3.

CEO, President & Director
