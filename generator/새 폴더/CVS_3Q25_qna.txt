Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.

Lisa Gill
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I really want to start with some of the comments you made on the PBM side. So first, the $240 million that you talked about, as we shift more towards transparency, towards TrueCost, should we anticipate -- and again, this kind of goes to Brian's comments around '26 as well, should we anticipate as we see shifts in these contracts that we're going to continue to see headwinds as we make that initial shift? So that would be the first part of the question.

Secondly, how do we think about future PBM economics around a TrueCost model, not only for you as the PBM, but we also get questions around the plan sponsor. So as we know, many plan sponsors use rebates to offset premiums, et cetera, so how does that future look on the plan sponsor side as well as your economics on the PBM side?

J. Joyner
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Lisa, great question and something that obviously we're prepared to address both today as well as where we see the marketplace evolving. But let me first start with, I think if you look at the headwinds that we're seeing specifically within the PBM, this does reinforce the strength of a diversified company. So this is the third consecutive quarter where we both exceeded and raised guidance. It highlights the focus and the commitment that we've made around building trust and credibility. So I think that is what I want to make sure is known that there's performance again across the broader enterprise.

A couple of things as it relates to the PBM and specifically to your question about the future. Over the course of my 30-year career, Caremark has consistently driven innovation and been able to adapt to the changing market. The drive is not just changing the way in which our teams are working, but we've talked over the last couple of years about changing the PBM model. And part of this is the TrueCost transition to what I believe will be the pricing model of the future. So I remain confident that Caremark will deliver both on the strong earnings and cash flow for the foreseeable future. And I think it's going to be reinforced in what we've said about the selling season. Even in light of some of the challenges around the industry, we delivered $6 billion of new wins and had a high retention rate in the 90s.

So I'm going to let Brian speak to some of the financials and some of the pressures, then I'll have Prem speak more broadly to the last question about where this is going from a PBM model. Brian?

Brian Newman
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, David. And Lisa, thanks for the question. I think if we take a step back, I think it's actually important to provide some context on the historical industry practices. Historically, the norm in the industry was to use an aggregate market basket-based approach to structure guarantees. And I think as we highlighted in our prepared remarks, throughout the year, we've observed a combination in mix of drugs, in utilization patterns that differed from our prior forecast. And given the market basket structure underlying the client guarantees, those dynamics are putting pressure on the contracts David actually mentioned in his prepared remarks.

So we've been closely monitoring the trends. And I think we realize -- while we realize the impact that the market basket had on guarantees on a subset of our contracts, we actually believe we had a credible and achievable pathway to mitigate the rapidly emerging challenges. So as we closed the quarter, we realized the mitigations that we had identified. They didn't materialize as quickly or have the impact we had initially anticipated. And that's really the driver as a result that drove us to modestly miss our expectations in the third quarter. So we've also revised our expectations for the full year. That's captured in the guide I gave. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it will have an impact on the near-term growth outlook as we recontract over the next couple of years.

Prem, maybe you can talk more about the value Caremark delivers and the evolving model.

Prem Shah
Executive VP & Group President

Yes. Lisa, thanks for the question. And just to answer directly on the future PBM economics, as you know, the PBM industry has been and will continue to be an extremely competitive space where we deliver tremendous value to our customers and deploy that value to them. If you think about our -- from my perspective, what Caremark has done over the course of the last many decades is we continue to focus on our clients' biggest problems, which is high cost of branded drugs. As we've said, 10% of drugs drive 88% of our pharmacy costs in this country. And we're going to continue to lead and be a leader in this space.

You saw this 18 months ago, we launched Cordavis. We went after the largest specialty drug in the country. We delivered our clients over $1 billion in savings and we've interchanged and moved all the product to a lower cost, 81% lower WACC price than the originator, and we delivered $1 billion of savings. You saw it earlier this year with our addressing GLP-1s. GLP-1s are approximately 15% of our clients' cost. We were able to narrow our formulary in the weight loss category and our clients benefited from lower cost. And I would argue, the market benefited from the fact that we moved against one of the products. And we saw the list -- or sorry, we saw the net prices of the entire category come down. This is what PBMs do every single day. They create this competition. This is what they've done for the last 3 decades and will continue to do that.

As it relates to the value and how the economics kind of pass through from us and our clients and how that plays out in the marketplace, at the end of the day, the problem in this country still is health care is unaffordable. And what you're describing is really kind of the spread of which is a member out-of-pocket or a planned premium. And from our perspective, what we're doing with TrueCost, which we launched 2 years ago, was very deliberate, and it was driving greater transparency and making sure that consumers and clients had the benefit of that transparency while, again, maintaining our ability to create the competition and lower the net cost of drugs.

As David said in his prepared remarks, we have over 25 million customers and consumers that are in our point-of-sale rebate program. Aetna has launched point-of-sale rebates as far back as 2019. So this is something that we have been really focused on where we get the consumers the lowest possible price at the counter because we know medicines in this country help lower the cost of overall health care expenditures and it's critically important.

And lastly, I'll say, as all the things have been happening with the administration, we're excited to play an active role in making medicine more affordable in this country. We think we will continue to play that role. And we love the fact that they are going after the inequity across countries that you've seen and the price disparities that exist. So more to come, but I would say the PBM business continues to be a very competitive space, continues to have durable margins and continue to be a very necessary component of how we deliver care and lower cost in this country.

J. Joyner
President, CEO & Director

And maybe just one final comment. I think it's important to note that we saw this trend several years back, which is part of what we're trying to do within retail moving to CostVantage and where the PBM was driving towards TrueCost. So we saw where the marketplace is going. We led the market. We're in the middle of that transition to the model of the future. And again, I think the near-term headwinds is not an implication on the long-term viability of the PBM model. Thanks, Lisa.

Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

I wanted to ask about the PCW business. It looks like 3Q was ahead of your expectations and you have about 3% growth assumed for the fourth quarter. I was hoping you could share some of the drivers around your confidence in that fourth quarter growth, particularly the headwind from vaccine -- lower vaccine volumes to OI and then the benefit of the 600-store file buy you got from Rite Aid for the fourth quarter and how that EBIT impacts into 2026.

J. Joyner
President, CEO & Director

All right. Thanks, Justin. I appreciate the question on PCW. So Prem, do you want to talk specifically about the growth rate?

Prem Shah
Executive VP & Group President

Yes. Justin, thanks for the question. And as you recall from a few analyst days ago, we were very deliberate with our strategy and purposeful with how we were going to kind of get this business back to something better than minus 5%. But -- so a couple of things. One, I'm incredibly proud of the leadership team and the strong execution that we've delivered. We have the right strategy and we're focused on it, and it's a foundation of just health care engagement. It's one of the things we really believe. So we have over 9,000 community pharmacy destinations where we know we can service patients and members in a much better way to create differentiated services. At this point, I'm proud to say we are the best running pharmacy in the country. And it's operating nationally at scale. It has extremely strong consumer engagement and really good clinical expertise that we're delivering into the marketplace. And it's a very, very strong deliverer of trust for our consumers and we can then continue to create value in other parts of our enterprise.

When you think about what's driving that, first, from a business perspective, we were very deliberate in our investments in technology and taking care of our colleagues. We have over 200,000 colleagues in 9,000 of these stores that continue to deliver best-in-class service. And then secondly, we were focused on how we can engage and better engage consumers in a differentiated way. So all in all, it's going really well.

As it relates to the quarter, we delivered a strong quarter despite some of the persistent reimbursement pressures that we faced. If you look at the script growth, we had top line growth about 11.7%. And our pharmacy market share is now at 28.9%. Rite Aid was one of the drivers that was in that as we kind of moved that business into our operating model. But just remember, the strong foundation, the strong service enabled us to really be able to do that in a much more effective way.

And then if you think about the immunization piece, we continue to be a trusted choice and a convenient option for those choosing to get vaccinated. The market demand is down year-over-year, but we've been able to offset that with a market share growth in our channel. We've seen approximately 400 basis points of market share growth inside of CVS.

Secondly, if you think about our front store, we still have strong momentum. We're posting another positive comp for the second quarter in a row and improved from last year. We grew our customer base 2.6% versus last year. We increased trips 2.7% versus last year. And our retail market share on the front store has gained by 2 basis points versus last year. So we're continuing to focus on delivering the value being where consumers want us to be in the front store by driving loyalty and improving our value proposition. And I'd just say, all in all, we're incredibly proud of the results, incredibly proud of the leadership team and the focus that we have here, but we still have work to do to stabilize this business over time. And Brian, I'll hand it over to you for a couple more comments.

Brian Newman
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. No, just, Justin, in terms of the outlook, the strong performance Prem talked about in the quarter, we lifted our guide for the segment and it's now sitting at a growth of 3% for the year. And I'd remind you, that's an 8% swing from our initial expectations of down 5%. So we're seeing that business improve, and we'll talk more about it come December 9 at Investor Day.

J. Joyner
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Maybe just closing out on the PCW conversation, this is a business that we've been investing in over the last several years. I think some of this has come to fruition in terms of the investments we've made in becoming best-in-class. So we've talked about this in the opening comments that the 9,000 stores is our front door to the enterprise. And when this business runs well, it does become the force multiplier to improving health and our focus on serving the community. So really excited about the performance, and we'll share obviously more, as Brian said, on Investor Day about the future direction of this business.

Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.

We'll take our next question from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore.

Elizabeth Anderson
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I believe you can hear me. I had a question in terms of the 100 basis points of provider liabilities that you called out. Can you give us a little bit more detail on exactly what those are? And is this a onetime item? Do we expect this to continue for a couple of quarters? Just any additional color there would be helpful because, obviously, with that, it shows that your MBR was much more in line than maybe it looked like from the first glance.

J. Joyner
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Elizabeth, thanks for the question. And you're correct in that assumption. So Brian, do you want to speak to the...

Brian Newman
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. The -- I guess I'd lift it up from an HCB perspective, Elizabeth. We're really pleased with the performance in the third quarter. As you think specifically about the third quarter MBR, some of the noise I called out in my prepared remarks, we had about 100 basis points of impact, 2 things, provider liabilities. Those are from -- dating as far back as 2018 for kind of a 3-, 4-year period. And then a combination of that, that was roughly 50 basis points of the 100. And then worsening expectations for the individual exchange risk adjustment. We got the latest Wakely data that informed that. So those 2 factors really took a 92.8% as we printed. And if you back that up to get to a 91.8% roughly, it would say that the core outperformance on the MBR in the quarter was driven on an adjusted basis by individual MA. So that's how we think about the two drivers specifically to your question.

Operator

We'll now take our question from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.

Stephen Baxter
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Sorry for the difficulties there. Just to kind of come back to that point a little bit. I think with the first couple of quarters of the year, you sized in each quarter that, I guess, on a continuing basis, there was around $500 million core upside that you weren't taking through into the guidance. Wondering if there's an equivalent amount, if you think about kind of excluding the items that you called out around the exchanges and around the out-of-period settlements that you'd cite for Q3? And I guess how do we reconcile that versus the raise that you made? And I guess just one clarification as we're getting a lot of questions on it. This mid-teens EPS growth that you're framing for 2026, is that after taking the $0.45 out of the baseline? Or is that off of this year's guidance as you currently revised it?

Brian Newman
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. To take your last question, Stephen, you take the midpoint of the guide, which is $6.60, back off the $0.45 and then you can grow mid-teens off of that. And the way we got to the $0.45, I think going into the quarter, we had about a combination of net both positives and negatives. If you take some of the out-of-period risk adjustments and revenue adjustments net of the upside, we'd be about $900 million coming out of the first half of the year. You take the $150 million of the provider settlements, that's how we get to $750 million roughly or the $0.45 as we adjusted, which I just walked you through.

Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with Leerink Partners.

Michael Cherny
Leerink Partners LLC, Research Division

I know Lisa had asked about the PBM headwinds that you had been discussing. I want to talk a little bit more about the PBM tailwinds. Beyond Cordavis, what are you seeing broadly from a specialty growth perspective? And can you talk about some of the strategic advancements you're making to continue to benefit from what has obviously been an extremely strong overall market growth?

Brian Newman
Executive VP & CFO

Prem, do you want to take that?

Prem Shah
Executive VP & Group President

Sure. Thanks for the question, Michael. Just a couple of things. So from a tailwind perspective, as we've said, we see a tremendous opportunity to continue to lower cost for our customers. And as you know, when we can lower cost for our customers, the PBM industry typically benefits from that as well.

So a couple of things. One is if you think about the biosimilar pipeline, it still remains. There's $100 billion of biosimilars going -- biosimilar by the end of this decade or early 2030, 2031 time frame. So we continue to look at ways in which we can enable and drive down costs for our customers as it relates to biosimilars. We believe that there still is our ability to benefit from other specialty drugs as well in the generic pipeline that are going generic that will be an opportunity for us to deliver value for our customers.

And let me just take a couple of seconds to talk about our CVS Specialty Pharmacy business. It continues to be a leading asset in the specialty pharmacy arena. It's a leader and a key overall performance driver of Caremark, and we expect it will continue to be helping to support the members that they serve. Remember, these 1% or 2% of the population that utilize specialty pharmacy benefits typically drive 50%, 60% of all of health care expenditure. And so our business continues to perform really well. And we have a strong track record of continuing to gain access of new limited distribution drugs in that space. We continue to build technology that makes it seamless to transition patients from branded products to biosimilars.

And lastly, our operating platforms, a tremendous amount of credit goes to our leadership in this business is driving to a much more tech-driven AI native platform that's driving and really taking a lot of the work out a lot of operations and something that was one of the most complex parts of health care, which is effectively trying to drive these medications into the patients' homes. And so we continue really proud of those points as it relates to that.

We also see opportunities in the PBM for what I would say is efficiencies and optimization over time, where we see the opportunity to leverage technology and other things to also play a role. And lastly, I think the PBM sales season is great evidence that we continue to focus on our customers. We're winning net new customers and delivering the value that they're asking for us. So we had over $6 billion of net new sales for 2026. So continue to be excited about this industry. It remains to be highly competitive as it always has been. And we continue to remain to be a leader in driving that competition and driving affordability for our customers and creating innovative solutions that they can deliver into the marketplace. So...

J. Joyner
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Prem. Maybe just one additional comment on the PBM because there's obviously emerging models that we're seeing around the DTC. So 2 things I would point out. One is we were the first large provider to join the NovoCare program for GLP-1s. So that's again our push into lowering the cost of these obesity products in the direct-to-consumer market. And then the most recent announcement we made with the administration with respect to the IVF therapy, again, our specialty pharmacy playing essential or critical role in the rollout of that program as we serve consumers and our customers.

Our next question comes from Eric Percher with Nephron Research.

Eric Percher
Nephron Research LLC

I'd like to return to Caremark and ask you to clarify the extent to which you're seeing pressure from adoption of TrueCost versus change in mix. If it's TrueCost, how much of that was CVS? I'd expect you were ahead of that versus others or independents that you're enabling. And then if more change in mix, are you seeing that changes to GLP-1 formulary or biosimilar private label is having an impact on rebate guarantees?

Prem Shah
Executive VP & Group President

Yes, Eric. Thanks for the question. First off, let me be clear, this is not from TrueCost. The TrueCost model is not what's driving this. As you know, in the legacy PBM models, in the PBM marketplace, we predict and try to drive rebate guarantees, which is a way in which we derive the value for our customers. In that case, we had probably 3 primary drivers of some of the pressure.

One, the slower growth of GLP-1s that we're seeing in the back half, primarily driven from we expected a little bit more of the compounding volumes to come back into the benefit, which we're not seeing. Secondly, we had a couple of products on the autoimmune category not related to Cordavis, but drivers of a couple of products that we're driving that. So one is in the autoimmune category and one is in the HIV category. So this is not from TrueCost. It is something we're working with our clients actively adjusting our guarantees appropriately as we move forward, but create a little bit of pressure in the short term.

Our next question comes from Andrew Mok with Barclays.

Andrew Mok
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I wanted to ask about the recontracting efforts at Oak Street and understand the room for improvement there. So first, can you share the pretax operating losses of that business today? And to the extent you had problematic external membership this year, did you see the needed changes made to benefits for the 2026 plan year? And if not, can you help us understand what contracting changes you're making, including how much risk is shifting back to your Medicare Advantage partners?

Brian Newman
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks very much. I'll let Prem talk to the business and the evolution. We don't share the pretax loss, but I think we've been very focused on the Oak Street business. Once again, the impairment we took was at the HCD level. But we took a look at clinic growth and really by slowing the clinic growth, the terminal values, what drove the impairment charge. And we believe we're getting the Oak Street business in particular on the path to profitability.

Prem, do you want to give a little color on the business?

Prem Shah
Executive VP & Group President

Yes, sure. And thanks for the question. First off, just to be really clear, the performance in this quarter was in line with our expectations that we kind of -- as we adjusted the guidance from prior. So performance is in line. If you think about value-based care, and David mentioned this in the prepared remarks, it's still a critical component of our strategy. We recognize the significant impact it can have on the health care system, the importance to patients on experience and outcomes and costs. So there's 3 or 4 things that we're really focused on in Oak Street Health.

Let me just talk specifically to the payer contracts. One, we won't comment on any specific contracts, but we're focused on ensuring that we have alignment with our payers on ensuring the sustainability of these agreements and having fair and equitable terms for the value that we provide. So we're continuing to work on that with our payers and continue to drive that forward. But the 2 other areas I think that are really critical is we are really proud of our clinical model that we have. We continue to enhance our technology and our operations to drive an enhanced model in which we'll ultimately lower cost and improve quality of our members.

And lastly, on the center footprint, listen, at the end of the day, the world has changed in value-based care. So we're being very prudent and we've slowed the number of clinic growth that we had. And we're focused on growing membership inside of our clinics. And so from our perspective, those things are all the components that are driving. And we expect the Oak Street business to improve year-over-year. And lastly, as it relates to V28, it's in line with our expectations of the impact of that as we think about that business.

Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.

George Hill
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

David and Brian, my question is kind of focused on the retail pharmacy business. And you talked about how 2026 is going to show an improvement from the long-term guide. I guess I would ask if you can comment, how far are we away from like the long-term guidance of down 5% not being the case anymore? And given the PBMs are paying pharmacies more money and CostVantage is taking root across different payer segments, does earnings growth starts to look more like script growth in that segment? I'll stop there.

J. Joyner
President, CEO & Director

Yes. When we -- thanks, George, for the question. Maybe just high level, when we announced CostVantage, that was a long-term goal, which we are the largest purchaser in the country today. We believe we have the best cost of goods in the market. And as we perform better, the payers will get the benefit of that. And so that is, we are now going into year 2 of that in '26. So as we get to Investor Day, we'll have more clarity about how that business will be performing. But ultimately, we do see better alignment with the payers in terms of how the actual cost of goods align with the actual reimbursement for the services we're providing.

And so, Prem, do you want to give any other color?

Prem Shah
Executive VP & Group President

Yes. So George, remember, those 3 primary headwinds in the retail business, if you go back when we started CostVantage -- sorry, 3 tailwinds that were offsetting one big headwind, which was reimbursement pressure. So the 3 tailwinds were we would always drive incremental volume into our stores, right, script growth. We would have productivity initiatives that drove and lowered the cost of our cost basis of delivering those scripts. And lastly, there was cost of goods improvement. And all that netted out to a somewhat tailwind -- or a headwind that we're trying to cover.

If you think about what CostVantage was doing and, as we mentioned, it was going to take a multiyear journey to get us to a place in which reimbursement erosion equaled our cost of goods improvement. We're making good progress towards that, but we still have reimbursement pressure in the underlying business that we continue to focus on. So just from a CostVantage perspective, as we said at the beginning, 2025 was a transitional year. We're proud that we moved all of our commercial and third-party discount card programs into our CostVantage program. We're making good progress in Medicare on transitioning to cost-based pricing models across our full look of business. We're more than 60% complete and targeting 100% of our eligible book by the start of 2026.

If you compare our Medicare negotiations to our commercial negotiations, we're ahead of where we were last year. So we feel pretty good about where we are. And lastly, if you think about the impact of CostVantage, at this point, it's performing in line with our expectations. As I said, it's going to be a multiyear journey to get that back. And we're addressing one of the major pain points that existed in retail pharmacy, which was cross-subsidization of branded and generic drugs.

J. Joyner
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And George, maybe one final comment. Your thesis is right, which is our growth should be tied to script growth. And as we get CostVantage rollout across our payers, that will become part of the growth.

The second part is the services we're going to provide inside the pharmacy. So if you look at the stars performance within Aetna, a lot of this was driven because of the collective enterprise effort and the services and the specific programs that have been delivered and launched within retail to engage and drive better performance around adherence and the other quality measures. So that is the next frontier, and this is how we're going to collectively drive the value across the enterprise.

Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS.

Kevin Caliendo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I want to ask a little bit about what's embedded in your '26 comments for the Health Care Benefits around MA margin expansion. Can you get to be profitable next year? And also enrollment, I know enrollment is not over yet, but your sense of where your enrollment goes in individual MA next year.

Brian Newman
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks for the question. As we think about the guide, which we'll really get into in December at Investor Day, but in HCB, which you asked about, I would say we expect another year of meaningful margin improvement. It will include progress in MA. I think that reflects our disciplined approach to the plan design and footprint. We have repricing opportunities in group with, I think, about half the book repricing as of January. As you think more broadly about HCB, we'd expect a tailwind from our exit of the IFP business next year. And while we're seeing good progress in Medicaid in terms of rate advocacy discussions, we are taking a cautious outlook in light of the broader pressures that are across the industry.

Steve, do you want to provide a little bit more color?

Steven Nelson
Executive VP & President of Aetna

Sure. Thanks. Look, when we entered this year from the Aetna perspective and all of CVS together, we're focused on a couple of objectives. One is to return the business to target margins; second, to regain leadership position overall in the industry. And within those objectives, we rallied around 3 very specific priorities: to be exceptional to fundamentals, make sure that we are distinctive and we could offer distinct capabilities to our customers and build a really strong culture with top talent. And so we've been executing with discipline and rigor and urgency around those 3 priorities.

And as you can see by the performance, and as Brian highlighted and David in his opening remarks, the plan is working. And so we are really encouraged by the progress across all of our businesses at Aetna. And we believe this momentum will carry into not only the fourth quarter, but 2026. So we're going to lean into that momentum. Having said that, we're obviously respectful of the high trend environment, and it's a first year of a multiyear recovery. So really encouraged by the progress.

And maybe I'll just -- a couple of comments on Medicare and open enrollment as you asked. Look, obviously, early days, but it's going according to our expectations in line with those objectives of returning and continuing on the path to returning to target margins on this business. We made really great progress. It actually is a little bit ahead in terms of favorability, in terms of trends and the individual Medicare Advantage business in the third quarter. And so we're going to take that momentum. And the early signs in AEP is that we're on track to continue that momentum and keep the business on track to returning to target margin.

With respect to just sort of overall competitive positioning, we like our position. Again, early days. We do have the ability and we've developed capabilities as we did last year during the AEP to continue to make adjustments and be nimble as we need to dial up and down products, geographies, other kinds of mechanisms that we have just to make sure that we continue on track in a really disciplined and rational approach. So so far, so good. And I would just say, we expect to exit AEP roughly flat in our individual Medicare Advantage membership. So very encouraged so far, early signs. Look forward to providing more color at our Investor Day.

J. Joyner
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Steve, great quarter, and congrats to you and your team.

So this will conclude the earnings call for this quarter. So before I end the call, I just want to thank our dedicated colleagues across CVS Health for the work you do every day. The trust we earn comes directly from the commitment to caring for our customers. I'm very encouraged about the progress we continue to make and look forward to providing you additional updates at our Investor Day on December 9. Thank you for joining the call.
