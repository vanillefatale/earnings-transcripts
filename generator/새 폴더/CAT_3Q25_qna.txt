[Operator Instructions]

Your first question comes from the line of Kyle Menges from Citi.

Kyle Menges
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

It sounds like backlog growth was driven by power gen, and you alluded to orders for data center prime power applications as well. So could you just talk to the emerging data center prime power opportunity? How much latent capacity you think you have at Solar to meet this demand? And what you think you could actually deliver in the next year, given we've heard some big numbers getting thrown around by some of your customers? And then also just curious what that data center prime power backlog is looking like today.

Joseph Creed
CEO & Director

Kyle, this is Joe. So we're definitely really excited about the prime power opportunity with data centers and more broadly, just the demand for power that data centers and broader trends in the industry are putting on to the grid. We're going to see a lot more of this, I believe. Prime Power is a great opportunity for us because it creates services opportunity as we move forward as well. So definitely, you saw the Joule announcement that's in our reset. Part of our capacity addition there will go to serve some of that. And with Solar, we're seeing a lot of ordering activity, and it's really healthy, as you suggest. It's not just power generation.

Power generation is seeing more activity, but oil and gas has been really strong, too, because we're moving a lot of natural gas, and I think that trend is going to continue. So definitely a really positive outlook at Solar turbines. We're able to keep up with the orders that we're seeing right now. Lead times are starting to get a little more extended at Solar. They're not to the extent of those super large class turbines that more utility scale, but they are starting to get extended. And I would say the way we're thinking it's shaping up in our backlog, the larger turbines, the Titan 250, Titan 350 are longer lead times than the smaller ones where we're able to react a little faster and have a little more.

As it comes to capacity and things, we are always evaluating capacity. That would be a great thing when we need it. We're prepared to act when we feel like we need it, but we're in -- we feel like we're able to meet the orders that are coming in right now.

We'll move next to Angel Castillo at Morgan Stanley.

Angel Castillo Malpica
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Congrats on the strong quarter here. Just kind of following up on that E&T conversation. Obviously, growth here remains quite robust. I wanted to touch a little bit more on the kind of price realization and margins for the segment. Those have remained a little bit more stable, and I think you talked about 140 basis point kind of headwind from tariffs. And maybe just to kind of expand on that topic a little bit more, just two quick questions.

One, is there anything else kind of capping prices and margins for E&T as a whole? I don't know if it's mix first-fit versus services or anything else that you would note? And then related to that, for Power Gen in particular, should we be assuming something kind of greater than the 30% type of incremental margins you typically see in E&T given the strong pricing and volume trends there for the next 2 years? Or how would you kind of characterize that contribution to margins from power gen?

Joseph Creed
CEO & Director

I'll make a comment and I'll let Andrew maybe talk about the margins. But we're definitely each of our businesses and segments in a little bit of a different position. In the machine part of the business, we're in an unconstrained environment. We were constrained before, and we returned to a much more normal competitive pricing environment. In E&T, as you know, we're putting capacity in. Demand is really strong. And so we've been able to take pretty regular price increases, and we expect that trend to continue.

Tariffs as well are not evenly spread across there. So we're a very heavy North America footprint in E&T. And so when you look at the margins, they've hung in there a little bit better than maybe a couple of the other segments. So pricing across our businesses, we take into account many different things, and E&T is definitely in a better position just given where that business is in the cycle and where we are from a demand standpoint and the outlook moving forward.

Andrew R. Bonfield
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And on margins, I mean, if you look this quarter, I think it was very impressive that E&T was actually able to manage flat margins despite the impact of tariffs and actually would have grown substantially without that. And I think that gives you an idea of the strength of the pull-through that is occurring.

Just to remind you that if you look at our margin targets as a whole, and we manage margins at the enterprise basis, obviously, our focus is always on our absolute OPACC dollars and growing OPACC. So if there's a volume opportunity, which may not be necessarily as margin accretive, that doesn't mean necessarily we will pass on it because absolute OPACC dollars actually drives total shareholder return in our mind. But if you look at our margin targets, that requires a pull-through over 30% across the whole of the range when you look at where they are. So that gives you an idea of what we would be expecting from all our businesses when we're looking at margin accretion.

We'll go next to David Raso at Evercore ISI.

David Raso
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Yes, building on that, I mean, given the backlog, retail activity, lower rates, secular growth, I mean, the revenues, the expectations on the Street for '26 are going to go higher. The real debate is going to be the incremental margin. And building on what you just discussed, not looking for '26 guidance, but just some puts and takes thinking about 2026 at a high level.

Obviously, I was intrigued by the price realization comment about being flat in the fourth quarter. Be curious, in particular, when you think about that going to '26, especially for construction. Also the capacity expansions out there, the efficiency of that capacity coming on? Should we think of some potential headwinds adding be a turbine or even more recip capacity or maybe you can do it more efficiently, the sales mix, geographic, let alone product? And maybe lastly, of course, Andrew, anything else to consider puts and takes that we're not thinking about incentive comp, even things below the line tax rate. It's just that's going to be the debate, right, the margins, the incremental. So anything you want to answer from those, I'd really appreciate it.

Andrew R. Bonfield
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, David, I think you -- I think your question actually covers about the whole of 2026 guidance. So I think, as you know, we will talk a little bit more about that when we get to January when we update you. We're still in that planning process. So it's still very early. I mean, obviously, just stepping back, though, obviously, demand across the business is strong with the backlog that positions us well. Obviously, as you look out, we are now lapping the impact of price. That's why we don't expect price to have an impact on the fourth quarter. So that's obviously a positive, which we don't have that headwind.

Tariffs will still obviously be a headwind as we move into 2026. And you asked about the tax rate. And as I indicated in my comments, this year, we did see an increase in the tax rate. That's just due to the changes in the way the legislation works from the capitalization of R&D in particular, to the immediate expensing. That obviously is cash benefit to us, but booked tax negative. That obviously goes away. And then you'll start seeing some of the benefits of some of the foreign tax adjustments that were made in the legislation, which will be a positive for the tax rate as we move forward. But we'll give you more details. And hopefully, we'll give you a little bit more color on our expectations as we talk in Investor Day as well next week.

Operator

And we'll move next to Tami Zakaria at JPMorgan.

Tami Zakaria
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Curious about your thoughts on what drove the acceleration in sales to end users in the quarter in every segment in every region, except APAC. It seemed like some light switch got turned on. Did you anticipate this acceleration maybe because you had product launches or dealer incentives planned? So my question is, are you gaining share or the end markets have just been getting better on all sides?

Joseph Creed
CEO & Director

Thanks, Tami. We're definitely pleased with the momentum we have in all three of our segments and seeing positive SKUs and momentum continue. Definitely in E&T, as we mentioned in here, right, we're trying to get out as much product as we can, particularly on large engines. So we were able to get out a little more product in the third quarter through the factory, and I'm happy with the way the capacity expansion is coming on. Many of you were able to see that earlier this year in Lafayette.

But as we're bringing that capacity online, we continue to work with our supply base and the team there to get out as many units as we can. So that's creating some positive momentum there. I think -- and when you get to RI, some timing in some of the SKUs as to when some of the things get commissioned. And just remember that we've got great momentum in orders and the way that business is going. But from quarter-to-quarter, things can move from one quarter to the next.

And we continue to see just great pickup, particularly in North America on our merchandising programs with CI. So we mentioned the industry dynamics are a little softer, and we're continuing to perform and able to make strides. And I think what we have in place is working and generating great momentum. And that gives us -- obviously, the backlog going up as well gives us good momentum heading into the fourth quarter and into next year. So we're just really happy with the way the business is performing right now.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Mig Dobre at Baird.

Mircea Dobre
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I'd like to go back to Construction, if we can. So it's interesting that sales to end users are accelerating. I am curious how much of this do you think is simply a function of the various incentives that you put through rather than just the end market getting better. It sounds like your dealers are looking to add more fleet to their rental operations. So maybe you can talk a little bit about that.

But perhaps the bigger picture, as we think about '26, if demand does look to get better, this segment has been absorbing the brunt of these tariff headwinds. How do you think about the puts and takes next year? Do you think that you have the ability to manage these tariffs on the cost side? Or should we be thinking that trends here are solid enough to where you can actually start pushing some price to be able to offset some of these very real cost headwinds that you've experienced in '25?

Joseph Creed
CEO & Director

Well, there's a couple of different questions there. I'll start maybe on the demand side. I think the performance of the business has been better than the general industry, and I believe that's due to the strategy we have in place and the merchandising programs that are out there.

As we finish the year this year, as you point out, I think we'll be in a great shape on dealer inventory. So heading into next year, we'll see what happens, but we've got great momentum, and we're hopeful that, that continues into next year, and we'll talk to you more about that in our fourth quarter earnings call.

As it comes to pricing, keep in mind, the fourth quarter, we said is flat at the enterprise level. So we're lapping the impact of these programs that are put in place. the way we're thinking about pricing is sort of our normal annual process, and we're heading into that time period now. Each of our segments, as I mentioned before, E&T is in a much different place than RI and is a much different place than CI. And then different regions of the world are also in very different positions competitively.

So we take a lot of factors into the consideration. Cost inflation is one of them, but also market conditions, competitive situation. As Andrew said, our goal is to grow OPACC dollars. So any volume impacts to these decisions, we'll obviously take that into account as well.

When it comes to tariffs, we've been able to really put some mitigating actions in, I would say, on the margins. They're the no regrets actions, same thing we talked to you about last time, short-term cost reductions, more belt tightening type of things. We've made limited sourcing changes where we have the ability to move sources without investments in our supply chain, but that's fairly limited.

We work on certifying more USMCA compliant products. But when it comes to longer-term actions, we've sort of talked about this before. We're a global business with a very complicated supply chain. We are heavily U.S.-based. It's our largest footprint here. We have over 50,000 employees, 65 locations in 25 states. We're a net exporter. We've increased exports 75% over the last 9 to 10 years. At the same time, our hourly workforce has grown 29%, but we have a broad and diverse portfolio that's very global and the supply chain is complicated.

If we're going to make longer-term adjustments to really offset tariffs in that way, it will require investments to do that, and they will take time because we'll have to certify components. We have to buy tooling, we have to validate them and test them. And so for us to make those types of decisions, we really need to have a greater level of predictability and stability in the situation.

As we know, trade deals are still being negotiated, and we're watching that very closely, and we have a lot of scenarios at play. We'll use everything in our toolkit when the time is right to react to the tariffs or to mitigate the tariffs. But I'm confident we'll manage it over time. It's just right now, if we do something that requires investment, I don't want to have to spend that money and then turn around and spend money to reverse it. So we're trying to take a measured approach. But we have great momentum heading into 2026 and as we finish this year, and we're really happy with the way the business is performing. So we'll continue to update you as we move forward.

Next, we'll go to Rob Wertheimer at Melius Research.

Robert Wertheimer
Melius Research LLC

I wanted to ask, I guess, around the shape of demand in resources, which you've touched on a couple of times. And is the order strength largely in gold, which obviously is going nuts and copper? Or is it a little bit more broad-based? And then if you had any comments, we've seen a couple of industry, including Cat investments in technology, software autonomy. Is there any upshift or change in customer orders on autonomy and/or advanced powertrains or anything else notable changing there?

Andrew R. Bonfield
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So I mean, obviously, order rates have remained pretty strong. As you would expect, where order rates are principally is around large mining trucks. That is the area of strength. From a commodity perspective, I would say to you rather than any commodity is strong, obviously, gold prices and copper prices are high. It's coal, which is probably a little bit of the drag, as you would expect and particularly in Indonesia.

With regards to autonomy, we continue to see greater acceptance by our customers of the need for autonomous solutions. And I think we'll be talking to you a little bit more about RPM and also about where we think the industry is headed next week, Rob. So if you don't mind, I'm sure Denise will be giving you guys an update, and you'll be able to ask more questions there about some of the things within RI in particular.

Operator

And next, we'll go to Kristen Owen at Oppenheimer.

Kristen Owen
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Two that are related to the backlog. Just first, can you comment on the contribution of CI and RI to the sequential backlog growth? And you made some comments on the year-over-year, but if you could hit the sequential backlog growth. And then second, when you talk about backlog or even revenue growth in oil and gas, would that include any turbine sales used for those prime power data center applications? Or should we anticipate that those will be allocated to the power gen backlog commentary?

Joseph Creed
CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Kristen. So the consecutive sequential growth in the backlog primarily came from E&T, and that was largely power generation and oil and gas contributing to that. As you did mention, year-over-year, we saw RI and CI up. So we're following a little bit of a seasonal pattern in those while still growing the backlog order activity across all three segments has been really strong in the quarter, and we're really happy with the momentum we have.

When it comes to Solar and where those sales go and where you see them in the backlog and sales to users, if it's a data center application, it goes in power generation. If it's traditional offshore oil platforms or gas transmission, then it would be in oil and gas. So that's how you should look at where those end up in the numbers.

Operator

We'll move to our next question from Michael Feniger at Bank of America.

Michael Feniger
BofA Securities, Research Division

Joe, just in 2010, there was a filing that CAT had out that put turbines at $3.3 billion of revenue. That was 15 years ago. Is that business closer to like $7 billion today? Is that $7 billion too low, too high? And just the fact that some areas of oil and gas CapEx like offshore has been weak, is that why you have some capacity to meet the orders on power gen? Does that change at all to meet this demand when you open the order book for Titan 350? When does that kind of plan happen? And does that change the equation at all as you guys kind of think about capacity going forward?

Andrew R. Bonfield
Chief Financial Officer

So with regards to revenues, we are not going to disclose Solar revenues. Obviously, you are referring to a period a very long time ago. We split the business into oil and gas applications and power generation and where it's mixed up with reciprocating engines for obvious reasons. But Solar is a very strong business. It's a very good business for us, as you know, and one that we will continue to support very strongly.

With regards to capacity, both actually, oil and gas applications are doing pretty well as well. So there's a lot of pipeline orders, particularly around gas transmission. And so that doesn't -- so there's not necessarily weakness, which allows us to continue to meet other demand. It's really about prioritization. And as Joe said, we will discuss and make capacity decisions when we're ready and when we see the need to do that, we'll notify you accordingly.

Joseph Creed
CEO & Director

Yes. Just I mean, as you're thinking about this a long time ago going back 15 years to 2010, the world in oil and gas is much different now as well, right? So you would have had a lot more offshore power in the Solar, oil and gas business. And now post shale, we are moving a lot of natural gas, and that's where we are very, very strong is in the gas transmission side. So I think the business is different now.

We continue to grow services and services footprint. It's the first business where we really leaned in on the digital front with long-term service agreements. And that's obviously, with Jim's background, helped shaped our strategy that's made us successful here in the last few years. So we're excited about the business. We're seeing a lot more demand in power generation.

We -- when we announced the Titan 350 and put that program through, we obviously had room to produce those units. So we're excited that we're getting good uptake on them even sooner than we had thought when we started the program a few years ago.

Operator

We'll move next to Jamie Cook at Truist Securities.

Jamie Cook
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Congrats on a nice quarter. I guess two quick ones for me. Joe, I guess what struck me about the quarter is just the backlog growth that you saw. I mean, to what degree do you think the Street should continue to expect backlog to grow? Because on one side, you have these projects like Joule, there could be more of those coming online.

The other side of it is you have the law of large numbers and potentially capacity coming online. So just the ability to grow the backlog because it just provides such earnings visibility, and my second follow-up is just understanding what you're saying on tariffs, by segment, et cetera. But should the Street expect the fourth quarter to be the peak of tariff cost headwinds? Can it get better from here as we think about 2026?

Joseph Creed
CEO & Director

Yes. So when we look at -- you want to take the last one first.

Andrew R. Bonfield
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So with regards to tariffs, I mean, obviously, it really does the timing of mitigation actions, as Joe mentioned, will really be determined by the greater degree of certainty that we get out there. Obviously, all factors are on the table, and that will include potential for price. But obviously, that will -- we'll make those decisions as we would normally do within our normal time frame.

With regards to -- obviously, the $650 million to $800 million is based on most of the -- all the tariffs that will be in effect on November 1. So there is one month for some of the tariffs, the 232s. Obviously, the other factors which impact tariffs are the degree of imports in any quarter. But that would be the sort of run rate on an unmitigated basis that you would expect to see.

Joseph Creed
CEO & Director

Yes. And Jamie, it's a good question on the backlog. And I think you expressed it well, right? There's a nuance to it. We continue to see significant demand, particularly in E&T. We're seeing more. I think we're at the early stages of the prime power opportunities. So we're excited to have more of those come online. We talk to our large data center customers, both hyperscalers and colos, frequently, monthly, mostly even to manage that forecast.

So we have great confidence in the pipeline that's out there, and that's why we're putting the capacity in, and we continue to raise the capacity. So I think it kind of depends on the circumstance. We like the fact that the backlog is going up. I'd like to maybe if the reason the backlog goes up a little less is that I'm able to get out more and more product and keep up, I think that's a good thing.

So we think it's positive. I would expect us to continue to see momentum in there. But we are getting pretty extended on some of our products in E&T, and I'd like to try to at least get that stabilized or brought back in if we can.

Alex Kapper
Vice President of Investor Relations

Audra, we have time for one more question.

Operator

Today's final question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies.

Stephen Volkmann
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. Joe, you mentioned services a few times with respect to Solar. And I know for most of Cat equipment, a lot of that services revenue accrues to the dealer, but I think Solar is a little bit different. Can you just talk about how that's different and how the services business kind of impacts Cat directly rather than the dealers?

Joseph Creed
CEO & Director

Yes. It's -- as you stated, Solar is a direct business model for us. So in Cat branded products, obviously, the dealers service the equipment in the field. We sell them parts and support them with some other ancillary services. But when it comes to Solar, we have our own field technicians, our own group. So those units, as you know, run continuously. And so we pride ourselves as having tremendous customer service here, and that's why customers like us. So as you point out, as Solar sales pick up, even in the power gen space, it's all prime power. That's a great services growth opportunity for us.

And I would say even in the Caterpillar side, projects like Joule, and that will come in a few years' time, not as much in the early years, the more prime power opportunities we're able to satisfy with our customers, the greater service opportunity for us down the road in a few years' time. So we're continuing to build that momentum in services.

And you'll get a little chance, those of you who are coming to Investor Day next week. If you're able to stick around and go to the Solar plant in DeSoto, you'll be able to ask a lot more questions and get a better understanding of that.

So with that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. We always appreciate your questions and the interest in our results. We've had a great quarter. I'm really proud of our team for the solid performance. And so we're really excited to see you all next week at Investor Day, and I look forward to sharing more about our bright future and the attractive growth opportunities ahead.

With that, I'll turn it back over to Alex.

Alex Kapper
