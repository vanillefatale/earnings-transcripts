Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from John Hodulik of UBS.

John Hodulik
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Great. And good to talk to you again, Dan. Dan, can you expand on your vision of the company and what you expect to accomplish, say, over the first 100 days? And specifically, if possible, can you touch on or provide more details in terms of how you expect to turn consumer volumes?

Daniel Schulman
Director & CEO

Nice to hear from you, John, and good to work with you again. Look, let me take just a quick step back. I'm extremely excited about Verizon's potential. We are building off tremendous assets. We've got an excellent network. We have got an iconic brand. You've got tens and tens of millions of loyal customers. We have a really talented team, but it's clear we need to enter a new chapter. The existing status quo is not acceptable for us. And I wouldn't be here if I wasn't fully confident in our ability to pivot.

The vision has 3 pillars basically to it. The first pillar is about shifting from being a technology centric to being a customer-centric company. This is about delighting our customers. This is about growing through retention basically. My aspiration is I want us to have the lowest churn rate in the industry. And when you talk about growing through retention, it is about creating the best value propositions segmented by the various segments in the market looking at all elements of our marketing mix quite thoughtfully and looking at creating the best customer experience possible. This is the full reboot of what Verizon means in the marketplace.

And this is not about onetime noneconomic promotional activities. That's not how you're going to win over the medium and long term in this marketplace. It's about being thoughtful across all elements of the value proposition and marketing mix and winning responsibly. And that's kind of what we intend to do, and we are well underway throughout the organization in making that shift. But I don't want to underestimate or underplay how big a shift that is for us, but it is the way that we win over the long term. Second pillar that happens simultaneously with delighting customers because we want to drive shareholder return simultaneously. I want to deliver sustainable revenue growth, accelerated bottom line adjusted EPS growth.

And as I mentioned in my script, the dividend is sacrosanct to us. We are going to examine every element of our OpEx and our CapEx, and we are going to fully fund all of our initiatives with OpEx savings and drop them to the bottom line so that we can accelerate EPS growth as well. And finally, the third pillar kind of supports all of this is a full review of our CapEx spend and our capital allocation. You can expect us to continue to invest heavily in growth areas with the path to profitability, whether that be completing our network, expanding our network, fiber aspirations, other opportunities as they become available to us in the ecosystem. We have a tremendous amount of financial flexibility on the balance sheet. We're going to do a hard look at portfolio rationalization and divest and exit legacy businesses where we don't see a clear path to profitability.

As Tony mentioned, we'll continue to pay down debt. We'll continue to be steadfastly committed to our dividend. And we will review, frankly, other opportunities to return capital to shareholders. And so I think just to summarize, we want to win responsibly in the market. We're going to do that through, let's call it, kind of growth through retention, looking at all elements of how we delight customers and at the same time drive shareholder returns. We think we can do both, and we're committed to that.

The next question comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.

Benjamin Swinburne
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Dan, thanks for all the helpful commentary in your prepared remarks. I had 2 questions sort of tied back to your comments. You made the point, Dan, that you think the reliance on price increases has been misguided or were not productive and not sustainable, I think it was your phrase. I think there's a view in the market that Verizon's back book is overpriced relative to sort of where the consumer is. And I'm curious if you agree with that probably oversimplified generalization? And more specifically, how do you drive share for Verizon higher in -- particularly in consumer without going through sort of a painful kind of back book repricing exercise, which I'm hearing from your financial commentary about accelerating earnings growth and free cash flow that you're not expecting.

And then I just was curious, you guys were very clear on your balance sheet and leverage targets. But would you be open to flexing the leverage higher if the right opportunities presented themselves. There's a lot of spectrum in the market, more coming from the FCC down the road, you have this Tillman agreement. So just curious if you could talk a little bit about the potential to take leverage higher, at least temporarily if the opportunities were there.

Daniel Schulman
Director & CEO

Ben, thank you for all of your questions. I hope I remember a couple of them at least. Look, I think my view on our approach into the market is to be quite thoughtful and financially disciplined. I think that we need to look at the reasons why customers are leaving us. And there are basically 4 that customers there are more, but these are the top 4 are price increases that we've done that customers run into some friction in the experience with us and we need to fix that. There's a value perception. I think I call it a value perception, not pricing. Because the value is all about price to value. And I feel we offer good value and -- but there's a value perception. And then there's obviously competitive intensity. There are a lot of offers in the industry.

Our game plan is going to address all of those pain points for our customers. We want to have the best-in-class experience. I want to leverage things like convergence. I want to create segmented and targeted value props and offers. I want to think carefully across all of the marketing mix. The are marketing 4 Ps. I always throw a fifth one in there, which is [ prayer ]. But I think like pricing is the last refuge of the marketing desperate. It is what you pull when you have nothing else in your quiver. And frankly, we have a ton of things to pull in terms of creating incremental value for our Verizon customers. And so although I won't go into specifics on how we're thinking about this because it's still early days and I'm actually never going to go into specifics because I don't want to tip off our competitors on what we're trying to do in the marketplace. But I think that we can begin to take our fair share of the new to the industry, postpaid adds, we're going to start off by increasing it because today, we take somewhere between 0% and some very low percent of the new-to-industry postpaids. We're clearly losing share, and that's not a sustainable path for Verizon. So we'll win eventually, our fair share of industry net adds going to reduce our churn to being the industry best. I want to responsibly win in a fiscally prudent manner. So hopefully, I hit a couple of your questions, at least there, Ben, anything else that you want me to hit on? Tony?

Benjamin Swinburne
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

No, that was really helpful, Dan. I appreciate it. Just I was curious on the balance sheet, any openness to flexing up if you had the opportunities?

Anthony Skiadas
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. Hi, Ben, it's Tony, good morning. So a couple of things there, very comfortable with the long-term leverage target. And as you know, we've had a long and demonstrated track record of execution with the balance sheet. The target is very appropriate for the company of our size, and the way we expect it to perform in the future. And I think you heard Dan talk about that. We have strong cash flows, as you've seen, we reiterated our guidance for the year at $19.5 billion to $20.5 billion for 2025. And as you heard Dan in his prepared remarks, we expect to have higher cash flows in '26 versus 2025. And that leverage target gives us the ability to invest for growth. And it also gives us a lot of flexibility and balance sheet capacity to be opportunistic should the need arise from a strategic standpoint. As we talked about, the deleveraging is on track. We're now inside of our long-term leverage target at 2.2x. We have Frontier coming in, as we said previously, that will add about 0.25 turn to the metric and that will be for a short period of time. So we are going to operate outside of it for a period of time. But the overall goal is not going to change. The focus is generating strong cash flows and execute across the entire capital allocation framework, and that includes continuing to pay down debt.

The next question will come from Michael Ng of Goldman Sachs.

Michael Ng
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Good to be reconnected with you, Dan. I just have 2. First, are there any parallels between Verizon and PayPal that informs your view of the opportunity for improvement? Where in the Verizon business, do you see the biggest need for a change agent. And then second, Verizon's Perks and MIPlan seems like a strategy where it puts it closer to a super app strategy relative to peers. Is this something that is important to your strategic blueprint? Any opportunities or key benefits that you would call out?

Daniel Schulman
Director & CEO

Nice to hear your voice again, Mike. I look forward to seeing you again as well. I think when I think about kind of when I first started at PayPal and now first starting here with Verizon, there are definitely some similarities. One of the big things that we did at PayPal when I first came on was declare that we were going to be a customer champion. And declaring you're going to be a customer champion kind of easy words. But if you're really going to be a customer champion, it takes hard work and it takes challenging your business model as well. It means doing what customers expect and addressing all of their pain points and then figuring out how to delight and surprise them going forward.

At PayPal, that was giving customers full choice on how they could pay, not by forcing them to pay with what was the highest margin funding instrument that they had in their wallet for us. And that unleashed a huge amount of growth for the company. And I think the same thing can happen here. We're going to invest heavily in our value proposition. We're going to fund all of that cuts in our cost structure. We have a tremendous amount of opportunity to be more efficient to be scrappier. In many ways, this is a turnaround for us and making sure that, culturally, we're ready to make that move from being technology-centric to being customer-centric. It takes some time, but there is no question that what I saw on PayPal, I see here in Verizon too.

The team here wants to reclaim their market leadership. And they will do anything that they can. Big companies are extraordinarily good at responding to a crisis. They're not necessarily good at day-to-day, but responding to a crisis, they're amazing. And this is really a clarion call to the company to refocus, regain our leadership by focusing on customers, delivering what they want, not doing things that don't delight customers. And so there are a lot of similarities, obviously, very different industries, different ways of thinking about it. And when you talk about the value prop and things like super app versus how we might think about that. Just give us a little bit of time to develop our thoughts more from where we are at a full effort underway right now, and you'll hear more about that as we go into January and beyond.

The next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup.

Michael Rollins
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Dan, welcome back, and congratulations on taking over as CEO. You mentioned a few times the importance of convergence. I'm curious to get your perspective on where you would like convergence to go over time in terms of the physical fiber footprint, how many passings you want to see that get to and the path potentially to get there as well as how you're looking at fixed wireless and whether it's time to incrementally invest in fixed wireless as also a way to drive more broadband business for the company. And then just secondly, following on your comments about accentuating the growth side of the business and deemphasizing or exiting legacy businesses. Curious if you could put more context around that as -- when you look at the Verizon portfolio in totality, how much of Verizon do you view today as strategic and growing versus legacy. And what are the ways you're trying to better frame that internally as well as externally for shareholders?

Daniel Schulman
Director & CEO

Yes. Mike, it's great to hear from you again. You've been around this industry for a long time, and I appreciate your thoughts and your questions. I'm a very big believer in conversions. I think it is extremely powerful. I think it offers not just meaningful revenue synergies, but as Tony mentioned and as we see, when you combine mobility with fiber, you see churn rates that are almost 40% less than what we see with our traditional mobility. And I think thinking innovatively about how we bundle together broadband writ large, and that includes both fixed wireless and fiber with our mobility to drive both incremental broadband revenues as well as incremental mobility revenues will definitely be on the plate. So expect us to continue to invest in our broadband footprint and our fiber footprint as well as our fixed wireless as well, but also expect us to think about that innovatively as I mentioned, because I think there's a ton of opportunity in that.

And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we'll continue to invest appropriately and aggressively in that expansion. In terms of kind of portfolio optimization, I think that's what you were talking about, kind of legacy versus broadband and mobility. Clearly, we're focusing on broadband and mobility. There are other areas, by the way, that I think we can focus that are maybe potentially large opportunity areas. Clearly, AI infrastructure is booming, and we can be a part of that and should be a part of that. But we have parts of our business that are costing us billions of dollars of margin. And I think we can think much more clearly about how do we invest in growth areas and divest or exit those that are not that for us and are actually hemorrhaging margins for us. We'll spend more time on that in January and lay that out for you in more detail, but you can probably imagine what we're thinking about and talking about on that. But I'll be more specific about that, and Tony and I will both be more specific about that as we get into early next year.

The next question comes from Sebastiano Petti of JPMorgan.

Sebastiano Petti
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Dan, congratulations on the role. I look forward to working together. Just maybe following up on the 2026 free cash flow. I mean, we're -- I understand the cost efforts will help -- basically help fund a lot of the growth initiatives that you're discussing here today and the pivot and your vision for the company. But relatedly and basically to Mike's question, and it's about the longer-term fiber footprint. How do we square 2026 free cash flow growth? I mean it sounds like CapEx is coming down this year, implication would be free cash flow probably trends towards the higher end of the range. And as you -- and Frontier is burning $1 billion of cash today. And so just trying to help understand that, the question we've been getting incoming from investors this morning.

And then secondarily, I guess, just maybe thinking about the accounts growth in the -- accounts decline in the quarter on the consumer as well as on the total wireless segment. Anything to help square there? It was the highest losses we've seen since the first quarter of 2020, rather, the pandemic quarter. So just helping us understand the trajectory there, and how we should be thinking about that trend over time as you kind of focus in on convergent.

Anthony Skiadas
Executive VP & CFO

Sebastiano, just on your question on free cash flow. So look, in the prepared remarks, we said we expect free cash flow growth to 2026 year-over-year. And that's all in, including Frontier. So some points on that, but that gives us confidence in that statement. So first, we have a very good starting point. The cash flow generation of the business continues to be very strong, and we have the strongest free cash flow in the industry. So we start there. And then in terms of actions, and I think Dan covered this multiple times, you should expect to see significant cost transformation. Dan talked about running leaner. Those plans are already underway.

In terms of the portfolio, we're looking at everything and everything is on the table for us. So -- and it also entails being very efficient with our capital spend. And what we said in the prepared remarks that we expect 2025 to get all our initiatives completed and will be likely at the lower end of the range or better, and that's the goal. And then as we look ahead, we said prioritizing investments focused on both mobility and broadband and being very efficient with our capital spend. We know how to do this, and that includes maintaining network excellence and also making sure we deliver on the promise for customers. And as Dan said, areas not aligned to growth will be deemphasized. And those actions are underway, and we're acting with a sense of urgency. So we'll be back in January with the full view of that, Dan?

Daniel Schulman
Director & CEO

Yes. Look, on account growth, I mean it just plays basically into what I was talking about before. The status quo doesn't work for us. We're going to be much more aggressive in delighting customers, and that has to happen. Look, it's a competitive industry, and all attractive and great industries are competitive. That's why people come into them because they're super important industries and most industries follow the rule of 3, and wireless is no different in that. I think about competition, a little bit how I think about gravity. When I get out of bed in the morning, I don't think, oh my gosh, gravity is pulling me down, it wasn't around, I could jump 20 feet high in the air, same way about competition. If it wasn't around, I'd have 100% share, but it is.

And both AT&T and T-Mobile are excellent companies. And with strong leaders with John and Srini, I have a ton of respect for both of them and their companies. But I feel like there's still plenty of room for growth in this industry. And on how you count it, somewhere between 5 million and 8 million new postpaid subs that enter into the industry every year. There's obviously switcher pools that are available. There's new and growing services, whether that be convergence or AI-powered infrastructure that can come in. So there's a lot of opportunity in the industry.

The key here for us is to win smart and responsibly, focus on what our customers want, not on our competitors. I feel like we can win this fight the right way. We earn it every single day. There's no need to ratchet up high promotional spend. We want to be competitive. Obviously, we want to be consistent, but there's no reason for us to be rationally aggressive to win our fair share out there. So we'll focus heavily and you'll see that on creating the best value propositions, they'll be very different than what you see today, make sure that we have the very best customer experience, and we are going to do everything in our power to make sure we delight customers. And again, thoughtful around all elements of the marketing mix. Look, we want to be so good that prospects want to come to Verizon, and our Verizon customers never want to leave us in. So a lot of work to do underway with that, but we feel good that we've got a head start on that, and we know what we want to go do.

The next question comes from Michael Funk of Bank of America.

Michael Funk
BofA Securities, Research Division

Dan, welcome back and congratulations to you. So Dan, I heard you loud and clear on growing through retention. So curious to hear from you, what strategies or tools you think best for reducing churn? And then how we should think about these as being proactive versus reactive when you think a subscriber might be on the verge of churning. And a couple more, if I could. So curious to hear if you think about utilizing AI to address the efficiency offers you laid out for us in retention as well. And then you threw in your comments about AI infrastructure is booming and love to know what that means for Verizon as an opportunity?

Daniel Schulman
Director & CEO

Bunch of good questions on the -- as I mentioned, we have a pretty good idea of what's driving churn. And so we have a pretty good idea on how to address all of those. In many ways, this is a multipart complicated business. And otherwise, it's pretty straightforward, honestly. And so we just need to hit these things one by one to reduce churn, continue to grow by retention, but also we'll have the right offers in the marketplace. We'll be competitive. And I think -- you'll start to see evidence of that even beginning this quarter. But as I mentioned, this will take some time as well. When you want to turn around your entire offering to the marketplace, when you want to redefine the culture, financial profile of a large company like Verizon, we need to do it in a very thoughtful, prudent manner, but with a nod to urgency and moving as fast as we can. We're going to be a much scrappier company than we've been before. We have a lot to do, and we're going to go out and do that.

On AI, I have spent a lot of time before I got here within the AI community help advise some of the CEOs in the AI community. So I haven't really keen understanding of where it's going. I think AI is the only technology I've seen in my lifetime where it does a step function improvement every 2 to 3 months the models that we have today are by far and away the worst models we're ever going to have. You can see anywhere between 300% and 600% improvement in those models over the next year. And obviously, they are becoming more and more powerful, and they are able to do more and more things.

The other thing that AI is doing is clearly shifting the way the internet operates on its head. The internet is much more of a wide cast broadcasting and AI is much more narrow cast, much more individualized to you. I think that, as I mentioned, we are just scratching the surface of how we use AI inside Verizon. AI can obviously be used to be more efficient to do things and satisfy customers in ways that we can't do today and do so at a much lower cost, and that goes for across multiple functions inside any organization, including Verizon. But really importantly, AI can be used to dramatically improve the value proposition that we put in front of customers.

To your point, we can anticipate when customers want to upgrade when they have an issue, what that might be proactively address it before it happens, tailor and customize offers at micro segment levels that can radically change kind of where Verizon is today and frankly, where our industry is as well. And so I think that AI is today, a very large opportunity. And as the years go on, will be an increasingly large opportunity for not just Verizon, but American industry.

Your last question will come from Peter Supino of Wolfe Research.

Peter Supino
Wolfe Research, LLC

Dan, nice to meet you in this way. I wanted to ask you 2 questions. One about costs and the other about fiber. On costs, I wonder if you could discuss the nature of the cost opportunities you see if there are some common threads or themes through them. Verizon looks productive on a headline sort of benchmark to peers level? And then on fiber, Verizon is on course this year to pass about 650,000 homes incrementally with fiber organically. And at the same time, it's laying out $10 billion to buy Frontier. And the 2 seem somewhat inconsistent in the sense that it's a rather slow organic fiber expansion in a rather aggressive external fiber expansion. I wonder if you could sort of reconcile those and let us know what you think an ideal organic expansion rate for Verizon's ILEC footprint for the organic fiber extension might be over time?

Anthony Skiadas
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So Peter, on fiber, I'll start there, and I'll hand it to Dan on the cost. So on few things here. So number one, I mean, fiber is not new for us. I mean we've been at it for 20 years, and there's plenty of room out there in our combined -- outside of the fiber footprint that we have today and with Frontier to be first on fiber. And as you saw recently, we signed a deal with Tillman to further expand our broadband build and maybe just some aspects of that deal. It's a capital-light partnership and it gives us the opportunity to go outside -- in markets outside of the pro forma footprint that we have and Frontier has and to increase the convergence opportunity.

And look, in this case, the fiber is going to be built to our standards, leveraging the Verizon brand and bringing Fios to more and more locations. It's a long-term deal, and it gives us a lot of optionality in the footprint to go in the future and really to go outside the footprint with good economics, and we did not have that ability before. And to your point, we're on track with our 650 (sic) [ 650,000 ] in terms of premise passed and Frontier, as you saw the results last night. We're also pacing to their fiber build. So we're not stopping. So -- and I think you see that in the results in the quarter and where we're heading and with the deal with Tillman, we have a lot of runway ahead with fiber.

And then I'll hand it to Dan on the cost.

Daniel Schulman
Director & CEO

Yes, thanks for the question. First of all, our goal is to reclaim our market leadership. It's as simple as that. And we need to invest to be the best in the marketplace. And that's going to take significant investment to go and do that, and we're fully committed to that, and we're fully committed to covering all of those investments through cost reductions, and redeployment of those cost reductions into our value proposition.

Cost reductions will be a way of life for us here. Honestly, I'm not that interested in comparing our productivity ratios to others and looking at how productive can we be as a company? What is the right place for us to invest, where are the right places for us to be leaner than we have, how do we use technology to do so. This is all about satisfying our customers, but there's tremendous opportunity for us to be a more nimble and agile organization.

Thank you, everybody inside the company knows that we need to invest in our value proposition, that we need to be customer champions, and that there's a lot of area for us to find efficiencies. We'll talk more details about that as we're working through our plans, but we see plenty of opportunity to be the most efficient company in the industry. Again, we're looking at every element of our OpEx and our CapEx spend to make sure that we invest wisely that we capture the growth areas in front of us and that we drive bottom line performance for our shareholders.

Brady Connor
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

Yes. Great. Thanks, Peter. Brad, that's all the time we have today.
