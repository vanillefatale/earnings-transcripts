[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jay Sole with UBS.

Jay Daniel Sole

Great. Obviously, really outstanding results today. Just curious what gives you the confidence to raise your constant currency sales growth guidance for the year, given the potential impact of tariffs in the U.S. And also at the same time, what gives you the confidence to raise your adjusted EBITDA margin guidance given the impact of tariffs?

Martin Hoffmann

Jay, this is Martin. Thanks for the question. I mean you have seen it in our first half year numbers. The brand has incredible momentum all around the world, very strong growth in all the regions, in all product categories, in all channels. If we look into Q3, we had a very strong start as well. Actually, it's very similar to what we said on the call last time. Again, in July, we had the strongest month in the history of the brand from an absolute numbers perspective. So that momentum continues.

We have a very strong order book. And at the same time, we are aware of the macroeconomic environment that is there. We want to factor that in. We know that we had a very strong second half of the year last year, which we need to factor in. So it's a bit of a tougher comparison compared to the first half of the year. But still, we are very confident in our ability, in our product pipeline and in the momentum that we are having. And then I think it's always important to take a step back and also look at where we want to be from a growth pattern perspective. We want to grow in a durable way. We want to focus on high-quality growth. And so that growth corridor that we are now going into is basically exactly where we want to be in order to drive healthy growth for the future.

We had 33% growth last year, 39% growth in the first half of this year, and so this reflects the strong momentum. I think if we look at EBITDA and tariffs, also here -- maybe a bit a longer answer. First, I think it's very important to now have clarity about the new tariffs and to have that executive order out there. Of course, we're not happy about the additional tariffs, but I think it's super important that this is nothing new for our industry. So ever since On exist, we have been paying around 20% import duty on the majority of our products imported into the U.S. from our Southeast Asian manufacturing places.

And so now this number is changing. It's changing to 40% for imports from Vietnam and to 39% from imports from Indonesia. But as a premium brand and as a fast-growing brand, we have multiple opportunities to compensate for these impacts of our cost sold. And with that, you have seen we are confident in increasing our gross profit margin outlook for the year. And we're also confident that we can maintain our gross profit margin in line with the long-term aspiration that we communicated at our Investor Day, which is 60% plus.

And it's really in moments like this where it's just super important to be clear what the brand stands for, and we want to be the most premium global sportswear brand, which means to deliver on our promise to our fans to invest into what differentiates us, and that's what we continue to do, and there will be no compromise on innovation, on quality, on customer experience. But over the last years, we have done so many investments and upscaling of our abilities to drive more gross profit margin, which means innovation products that come at higher price points. It's increasing our DTC mix, it's economies of scale on our product cost, it's supply chain optimizations. We have done price increases as of 1st of July in the U.S.

And we said, we are well positioned. And we have not even yet spoken to our retail partners, our factory partners about mitigation efforts, which is still something we can do, but we haven't needed it yet. So this gives us the confidence to raise basically all our financial numbers.

Your next question comes from the line of John Kernan with TD Cowen.

John David Kernan

Congrats on just tremendous results. Martin, maybe you could talk about the second half constant currency revenue growth, tremendous 39% growth in the first half. Obviously, with the guidance, you are conservatively planning for a bit of a deceleration. Can you talk to trends you're planning in wholesale and DTC and maybe give a little bit more color regionally in terms of how we should think about the phasing of that revenue growth in the second half?

Martin Hoffmann

Yes, very happy to do so. So as I just said, the momentum is very strong. It continues to be very strong to go into the quarter. At the same time, we want to grow in a durable way and in a premium way in the long term. And this has always been #1 strategy for us. And this is the growth rate where we want to grow at. And the first half of the year was super strong. And this actually puts us into a position to be even more meaningful about the additional levers that we are pulling to grow, to be more meaningful with adding additional doors, to be more focused on full price sales, to really put a focus on high-quality growth.

And I think this is an amazing position to be in. And this is guiding our decision-making and how much additional brand momentum we are driving and how we invest. And at the same time, as I said on the call, we can now already focus on what comes after '26 and what are we building for the long term and how can we invest into new things to drive that growth because we have so much confidence into the building blocks that we have at the moment. And at the same time, there are amazing products coming. There are many more new amazing retail stores in great locations coming. So there's a momentum that substantiates the outlook.

John David Kernan

Got it. And then maybe a longer-term question. You're running well above the targets you put out at the 2023 Investor Day. You talked long term about an adjusted EBITDA margin north of 20%. What are the levers for additional margin expansion given you're already running pretty far above the targets you put out for 2026?

Martin Hoffmann

Yes. I think we continue to prove almost with every quarter that we are on the right track and even ahead of the track to substantiate the targets that we have given. And I think we are very transparent where that additional profitability comes from in the future. So we believe there is continued opportunity to increase our gross profit margin with a higher DTC mix. Our own retail stores are -- continue to gain share, and we will continue to expand in that channel, and we see a strong spillover then also into our DTC channel.

Our apparel business will be growing and with that, will drive higher margin in the future as well, not only because it's a very strong DTC business, but also because we will be benefiting from economies of scale in there. You see that we are driving also economies of scale in our distribution costs. And at the same time, we want to take it step by step. And so we keep on investing in what is building the brand for the future. We keep on investing in marketing. We keep on investing in exciting projects that build the future like LightSpray or many technology projects. And so we are -- we want to grow in a meaningful way towards the 20% number, but I think we have a very clear picture on where that additional profitability will come from in the future.

David Allemann

And if I -- John if -- this is David, if I can expand from here, just kind of zooming out even more, our vision is to build the most premium global sports brand. And I think you've been following On for a long time, and you've seen us going from footwear to apparel, going from sports also into fashion. So you see how kind of we are developing the potential to be -- to have a very high margin profile as a business, somewhere between a sports brand and the fashion brand.

Probably the most extreme vision of that is what we're currently doing with LOEWE at very, very high price points. That's not where we're going in general, but it points to a future where On is playing at the intersection of performance, innovation and fashion and so that it increases, of course, the margin profile potential as well.

Your next question comes from the line of Aubrey Tianello with BNP Paribas Asset Management.

Aubrey Leland Tianello

I wanted to ask on new products and any more color you can give on the impact of launches like the Cloud 6, the Surfer 2 this year. And then as we look ahead to next year, how we should be thinking about lapping some of these launches and how you can keep the momentum going into 2026 with new products?

David Allemann

Thank you very much for the question. Yes, happy to talk about product and product in the future. First of all, let me say, we're incredibly excited about how we're building franchises. And as you heard me say before, we now have 9 franchises that deliver more than 5% of top line. And that wasn't always the case. When we had our IPO, it was 7%. Now the runner came into as the eighth now kind of a lifestyle shoe. The Cloudtilt kind of became the ninth. So we're constantly expanding franchises.

And of course, that creates broad-based momentum where we reach very, very different communities. What I'm currently most excited about is how we reenergize the Cloudsurfer franchise. So you've seen the launch of the new Cloudsurfer 2 with Elmo but -- now we also launched the Cloudsurfer Max, and we're continuing that momentum in the running space. The Cloudboom Max will launch in the future, the first super shoe for the everyday runner. So there's an incredible momentum in our core space of running. But then on the other side, we're really kind of growing incredibly in apparel.

And so we do exactly what we want going from toe-to-head. And so the apparel momentum is driving the brand to a much broader audience as well. And then I think on a third dimension, we're really also able to build product energy through the new sports that we're doing. So if you've seen what's happening in tennis and how our tennis stars are performing on court, that, of course, builds a lot of momentum for tennis product, but then also beyond tennis, just a lot of awareness for the brand.

Martin Hoffmann

And then maybe just adding for '26, there's no reason to believe that our level of newness slows down. We are planning to have exciting new launches of the next generation of the Cloudmonster and the Cloudrunner 2 very key franchises for us so then compounding against the launch of the Cloud and the Surfer this year.

Your next question comes from the line of Anna Andreeva with Piper Sandler.

Anna A. Andreeva

Terrific results. Congrats. Wanted to ask about the working capital improvement. Martin, on inventories, really tight at down 10%. How do you feel about the positioning there, especially in the U.S.? Did that constrain sales growth at all during the quarter? And then secondly, you mentioned selective growth with wholesale partners a few times. Should we expect similar mid-single-digit growth in wholesale doors globally to continue into next year as well? And what are you hearing from your partners, as it relates to spring orders, especially here in the U.S.

Martin Hoffmann

Yes. So starting with working capital, we have done a lot of work and really strengthened our teams and our internal processes to fulfill the customer demand with a lower level of inventory in our warehouses because we significantly improved our capabilities of demand and supply planning. Merchandising is a function that basically didn't exist for a long time. Now we have this as a very strong capability within On. So we feel very confident to run our company at a lower working capital level going forward, and this is an aspiration that we outlined in the past as well.

And so at the moment, we feel very good about the inventory position, and we have seen it in the second quarter that we were able to fulfill the consumer demand all around the world to the level that we also wanted to fulfill it. As you know, we like to be in a position where demand is a bit above supply. If we look into our wholesale partners and our key account partners, what they are experiencing, especially in the U.S., the momentum for the brand continues to be very strong. And I think it's important to basically dive a little bit deeper into the second quarter.

The region was growing with 23.6% on a constant currency basis. If we look at our DTC business, this was actually growing at close to 40% in that region. And this shows the momentum that we are having, and this is also a momentum that many of our key account partners are experiencing. And this puts us exactly in the position that we described that we need less incremental door openings in

order to have enough growth to be in the growth corridor where we want to be. So the mid-single-digit number is still the one that we are aiming to. And again, the good thing is we're in full control here, and we can really focus on premium same-store growth, but at the same time, on a very selective expansion of more doors.

Your next question comes from the line of Cristina Fernández with Telsey Advisory Group.

Cristina Fernández

Congratulations on the great results. I wanted to see if you can expand on the gross margin outlook for the year. Maybe unpack how much is FX helping the pricing benefits? And as you look at tariff mitigation, do you think more price increases are needed? Or would the one you took in July, your cover for the foreseeable future?

Martin Hoffmann

Yes. Thank you. I think I shared this a few times in the past. Our view on the gross profit margin is that we always need to expect that some impacts are on our cost of goods sold. And I think over the past 5 years, we have gone through different impacts from basically too much inventory or not enough inventory, to elevated freight costs and now to tariffs. And our focus is to put ourselves in the position to have enough power and enough strength in the brand and in the measures that we are taking to compensate for those effects.

And this is also how we are looking now at the additional tariffs. And as I said, we have done a lot of work to put ourselves in a strong position for exactly moments like the one that we are experiencing now. Of course, the price increase that we initiated for July 1 is supporting the gross margin outlook. We feel very confident that we don't need additional price increase to reach the margin targets that we now communicated because we have the ongoing benefits from economies of scale on the production cost side.

We have the impact of the foreign exchange rate. But again, this can always change and then other things become more favorable and maybe we see other disruptions in the future. And this is why the message that I gave earlier is so important that we feel very confident that we are -- we can maintain the gross profit margin on the level where we said we expect it to be in the long term of 60% plus. And that factors in basically that there's always something that disrupts that position.

Cristina Fernández

And then as a follow-up, on the apparel, you've seen good acceleration in the last 2 quarters. Can you -- as you look at what's driving that, any feedback you're getting from customers for your stores? Is it having it in DTC, the marketing? And I guess, what's next for apparel to build on that momentum?

David Allemann

Yes. Thank you for the question. I mean we're seeing an incredible energy in apparel, and that's driven by wider scale adoption of apparel in addition to footwear. So what we're currently seeing is that also first and second-time buyers of the brand are very aware of apparel and they're adding kind of apparel to their basket. So it's really kind of going from first adopters to a broader audience. And that's of course fueled by our direct-to-consumer channel.

So think retail. Retail, of course, is the classic channel where you build the entirety of an apparel brand where you get the full look and feel and the full range and as an extension of that, our e-com channel. And so as we're expanding retail, as we're expanding the reach of our e-com channel, of course, that drives a lot of energy for apparel as well. We also selectively work with premium wholesale partners in really showcasing apparel. We, for example, did a pop-up shop-in-shop in Selfridges. And -- so this is driving the overall momentum.

And then, of course, we are doubling down on some of the most exciting collections like the one that we have done with FKA twigs in our training category, the whole lifestyle apparel in collaboration with Zendaya. And so the awareness of these huge influencers helps apparel as well on the marketing side. And probably last, we invest a lot of innovation into the technicity of apparel. So for example, now for winter [ GardTec ] protecting you against the elements will be an important fabric innovation that continues to roll out. So we really drive on all levels.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Evercore.

Michael Charles Binetti

Congrats on a nice quarter. Can you just help us think about the cadence of revenues in third quarter and fourth quarter and then speak to how some of the drivers that you talked to us today about second half on revenues wrap around into the first half of 2026, as we think about the different regions and channels, particularly given the different growth rates across the regions that you guys reported in the second quarter?

And then I guess I'll just latch on to the last question about apparel and how we'll see that strategy evolve. You mentioned Zendaya and Selfridges. I mean, should we think about that category -- how should we think about that category evolving in -- with performance customers? Or is there -- is the bigger opportunity for this brand to attack some of the big market dollars in the athleisure categories?

Martin Hoffmann

Okay. I'll take the phasing and then David will take the apparel question. I mean you know we are guiding on the full year. And -- but I think what is implied in our guidance for the second half of the year is very much also indicative for where we see the regions and the growth in the regions. As we have said, we have a tougher comparison because at beginning of the second half of last year, we really significantly improved our operational capabilities. We had a very strong holiday season last year, but that picture is very similar for Q3 and Q4.

We continue to expect very strong growth in Asia Pacific. Also there, we want to grow in a premium way. So we will very much control the growth there as well. The U.S. is in a very strong position, but this is probably where we apply the strongest lever of cautiousness also in our outlook, given the macro environment. And then, yes, Europe basically is a similar picture so expected quite consistent growth rates in the 2 quarters. This is substantiated by the order book that we have. And as I said, if the environment remains favorable as we have seen it in the last 2, 3 months, then there is an opportunity to also outgrow our expectations. But at the moment, we want to approach the second half in a very reasonable way.

David Allemann

So probably to the second part of your question and currently, you see on apparel on the best running athletes. You see them on the highest mountains. You see it on the tennis court becoming very, very visible in a spectator sport. You see it in the leading gyms. So apparel really comes from core performance. But of course, sports is the new fashion. And so what we're building from core performance goes out to far more than core sports.

And you're alluding to that. Of course, we venture out. We venture out, for example, with the capsule that we have done with FKA twigs, highly technical, but a unique aesthetic. And we're building a sports fashion brand as well. And so that, of course, kind of gives apparel a much wider audience. Don't expect us to swim in a sea of sameness. We're going to do it highly elevated as a premium brand and very distinctively.
