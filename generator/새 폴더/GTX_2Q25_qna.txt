Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Hamed Khorsand with BWS Financial.

Hamed Khorsand

So my first question was, could you just talk a little bit about this unfavorable sales mix and how you're adjusting the business for such an environment?

Olivier Rabiller

Well, that's a very good question, Hamed. What we call unfavorable sales mix is basically driven by 2 things. On the one hand, there is a very positive thing that's happening to us, which is we are growing very fast on the gasoline side. And we are growing very fast on the gasoline side all over the world, whether it's in Asia, Europe and to a lesser extent in North America. So we are very pleased with that. But as you know, the margin rate on gasoline turbocharger is a bit lower than what we have on the rest of the business. But this unfavorable mix is a good thing to us.

Where we are seeing, on the other hand, a little bit of softness that is impacting us, that's the second aspect of that mix is more on aftermarket off-highway, and that's basically more in North America, where we have not seen the traction yet on the aftermarket that would reflect demand recovering because usually, the demand is recovering first on aftermarket before it gets into OE. And I think our customers are probably still suffering from the fact that their sales channels have been having a lot of inventory in -- or have built up a lot of inventory for the past few years.

So these are the things adjusting the business for us, do we adjust the business with the same recipe as we usually have. We have a high variable cost structure. And therefore, for us, it's working on the fixed cost like we do every year. But more than that, it's adjusting on the variable cost side, and this is something we know how to do very well in the company.

Hamed Khorsand

Okay. And my other question was, you ended the quarter with significantly more cash. Any reason why you didn't buy back more stock?

Sean Ernest Deason

Hamed, this is Sean. Our buyback is not linear. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're committed to returning 75% or more of cash over time to shareholders. So we believe the buyback is a very important tool to return value to our shareholder base, and we'll continue to do so. But it's not linear.

Our next question comes from Jake Scholl with BNP.

Thomas Jacob Scholl

Congrats on the great quarter. I just wanted to ask if you could help us understand some of the drivers of your stronger operating performance in the second half, especially with the volume assumptions roughly unchanged.

Sean Ernest Deason

Sure. We will continue to benefit from cost control. And I would say the other point I wanted to make is that right now, we've maintained our view -- our prior view. I think the latest S&P estimate might be showing a bit more favorability. So depending upon how the second half works out, more importantly is that could give us an opportunity to trend toward the upper end of our range if

we start to see volumes stabilize. But at the moment, we felt it prudent to be a bit more conservative in our guide from a volume and revenue standpoint as the impact of tariff starts to work its way through the system.

Thomas Jacob Scholl

Got it. And then just a smaller one, if you could provide an update on the tariff recovery situation. Do you guys still expect to be able to fully recover your tariff costs this year?

Olivier Rabiller

Absolutely. We expect that. Not only do we expect, but this is what we've achieved. And obviously, if the situation is changing, we'll adapt to the changing tariff. We have the tools in place. And since we've been recovering everything since the beginning, there should not be a change moving forward.

Our last question comes from Eric Gregg with Four Tree Island Advisory.

Eric Gregg

And to the Garrett team, just excellent results. Great to see all this communication on multiple levels. Two questions. In terms of these large turbos for backup data center, AI and whatnot, is that -- can you give us a sense of when you think that business or if you think that business will ever get to as much as 10% of revenues? Or I don't want to limit you there, but how big do you think that business can grow? And how substantial do you think it can be for Garrett?

Olivier Rabiller

It's a very substantial business. It's a big business for us because it's coming -- when you get into very large turbo, I'm not talking only about the genset one, but more widely all the applications. There are a lot of gensets and there are some marine. A significant part of the revenue once you've established your position is coming from aftermarket, and we love that. We love aftermarket. We have a very strong brand in aftermarket. We have a very strong network of distributors in aftermarket, and that's an additional activity that we would develop with them.

Before we get there, obviously, we need to establish our installed base. I'm not saying that it should reach 10% of the activity just on the genset backup power because today, that would be a big number. We would talk about $400 million a year. And I'm not sure that there is any player out there that's doing $400 million a year on the turbo business. I don't even think that the industry is that big to allow that. But it will be in the hundreds of millions of dollars anyway, and that should come within the next 3 to 5 years.

Eric Gregg

Great. And then the second question is really digging a little bit further on the linearity comments on stock repurchase. It was -- you probably did almost twice as much free cash flow this quarter. You had some of your sponsors who were more active on the sales front. Your valuation is incredibly low. Just -- and you did almost 30% less stock repurchase this quarter. So can you give us a better kind of just sense of how -- it's nonlinear, but why you didn't dig in further this quarter? And do you think you'll be more aggressive throughout the rest of the year?

Sean Ernest Deason

Like I said, it's not linear, and we had a very busy quarter. But what I would say is we also recognize that we have some dry powder for block trades as well if they happen to come up. But again, I would just reiterate the company's commitment and the Board's commitment to deliver to our capital allocation framework, which is 75% or more of free cash flow to our shareholder base.
