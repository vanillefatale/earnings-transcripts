[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Harbour from Morgan Stanley.

Brian James Harbour

Could you elaborate just on the same-store sales side? Do you think some of the kind of the macro pressures were what explained how you did in the 2Q? Do you think that was pretty broad across restaurants? And then -- or I guess, the honeymoon dynamic you described, do you think that, in fact, was a greater influence on that number and perhaps some of the older stores were delivering a better same-store sales number? Could you kind of parse out what drove that in the second quarter?

Tricia K. Tolivar

Yes. Sure, Brian. Good to hear from you. So certainly, we're operating in a fluid macroeconomic environment, and it's one that sort of creates a fog for consumers where things are changing constantly. It's hard to see the clear. And during those times, they tend to step off of the gas. We didn't see changes in our premium attachments or incident rates or other items driving the business overall. But certainly, it's present in there, and it's something that we're not immune to in this space.

As we think about the honeymoon effect, what we're experiencing is incredible results from our 2024 class as well as our '25 class, with the '24 class coming into the base and having an impact on sales from a same-restaurant sales perspective, but outperforming all of our expectations. So think about that restaurant class delivering their year 2 cash-on-cash returns in year 1, so well above the revenue expectations that we had, and delivering strong cash-on-cash returns while having a modest impact overall on same-restaurant sales in the period itself.

I think when you look at Q2, where we really started to see the deceleration is when we were lapping the launch of steak during the quarter. And that was a new menu item on our -- on the menu offering itself, one that was a perceived gap and resonated very well. And so it was -- the lapping of the steak during that period and what we saw as we exited the quarter and then entered into Q3, we're seeing a reacceleration in same-restaurant sales.

What we're excited about is that we are participating in a category that has tremendous strength in Mediterranean, driving tailwinds from a same-restaurant sales perspective and traffic overall with a concept that's resonating with consumers and a strong brand and then going back and delivering great cash-on-cash returns with a competitive position with no scaled competitor in the space overall.

Your next question is from the line of Chris O'Cull from Stifel.

Christopher Thomas O'Cull

Tricia, just a follow-up on your comments. Can you help level set where you're trending in the third quarter today, just given how far we're into the quarter at this point?

Tricia K. Tolivar

Yes. So when you look at our numbers, you look from Q1 to Q2, there was an acceleration in our 2-year same-restaurant sales stack, and we're seeing that trend continue into Q3, a continued acceleration of that 2-year trend.

Christopher Thomas O'Cull

Okay. And then, Brett, has the company evaluated its marketing media mix now that you've achieved higher awareness in a lot of these new markets? Obviously, new stores are opening up really well. I'm just wondering if there's an opportunity to reallocate the spend or even just increase it maybe as a percentage of sales.

Brett Schulman

Yes. Chris, thanks for the question. There's certainly that opportunity. I mean we are -- as you can see, we do not have a high marketing spend as a percentage of revenue. And we have continued to do a lot of testing around the media mix modeling, and we've seen some very positive results. So that's something we can certainly lean into if we see these kind of macroeconomic headwinds persist.

And as Tricia noted, I mean, when you look at the 2-year quarter-over-quarter, we actually accelerated. And that's -- the dynamic nature of our comp the last few years has been significant. So we guided on a 3-year basis last quarter to try and filter out the noise. But then underneath when you look at a 2-year, it's actually strengthening. So we're trying to be mindful of that and then look what we can do in the near term, and certainly, media mix modeling is a part of that and leaning into it, versus also staying steadfast on our long-term strategy and our initiatives.

And we've talked about this at length since the IPO that this is a marathon, not a sprint for us, that we are in this for the next 10 years, not the next 10 weeks and that we want to be positioned to deliver on our long-term strategic plan, which we are positioned to do and then be mindful in these cyclical instances of some macroeconomic headwinds, learning at these levers as we test them what we can lean into to drive increased awareness and adoption in the short term.

Your next question is from the line of Sara Senatore from Bank of America.

Sara Harkavy Senatore

A clarification then a question. Just in terms of the honeymoon period, does that mean the first year comps are negative or flat or just not giving you that 10% lift? I'm just trying to understand the magnitude of the shift. The question is about the Harissa Meal. I know you talked about the branding component of it. Was there like sort of a value component, too? It doesn't sound like you're seeing value seeking based on what they -- what you said about attach and premiumization. But just trying to understand the kind of shift that you might be seeing and if that was what motivated the meal.

Brett Schulman

Yes. Thanks, Sara. I'll take the latter part of your question and then hand it back to Tricia to speak to the new restaurant comp complexion. So the meal is not really geared to be a value meal, more so to really tap into the emotional connection of our guests and to celebrate their excitement over our pita chips and give them a little piece of CAVA to take home with them and certainly play off some of the cultural trends that we're seeing in regards to plushies. And again, this is a long-term brand building exercise and something that people can get excited about and drive conversation and drive awareness, and we've seen that. We sold out at a number of our restaurants in the first day and have been very pleased with the response. So again, this is how we think about it in the long term and was not geared specifically to be a value meal per se.

Tricia K. Tolivar

Regarding the 2024 class, there's certainly restaurants in that class delivering on our economic model expectations with $2.3 million in AUVs and generating 10% cash-on-cash returns. But due to the robust nature of some of the results in that class, those locations are experiencing some negative overall comps and impacting same-restaurant sales for us. And all of that was -- is a new dynamic from a honeymoon experience for us, and so one that we're going to keep a close eye on. But coming back to the restaurants in general are just really demonstrating the power and the demand behind CAVA and the interest that consumers have with the brand.

Your next question is from the line of David Tarantino from Baird.

David E. Tarantino

I guess another question on the comp trend you're seeing recently or maybe 2 questions. One is if I look at the guidance for the full year, the midpoint would assume something in the neighborhood of 3% or a little bit better than that in the second half. And Tricia, could you just maybe comment on whether your current trend line is tracking to achieve that kind of number or not?

And then I guess my other question is as you diagnose some of the slowdown that occurred, you talked a lot about macro issues and perhaps cycling steak and a small impact from the honeymoon. But are you looking at any brand metrics or operating metrics that might have changed over the last 3 to 6 months that might indicate there's something in the operations or consumer experience that may have changed?

Tricia K. Tolivar

Yes. Thanks, David. Our current trend line is in line with your expectations. So we saw strength as we exited the quarter above the 2.1% that we delivered, and we're continuing to see that accelerate as we move through Q3. I'll let Brett answer the second part of your question.

Brett Schulman

Yes, David. We haven't seen any atypical nature in a region, in an income cohort, urban versus suburban. The fleet has been moving very consistently. And then we recently did another run of our brand health scores. Our NPS actually went up. Again, we're #2 in the entire limited service space. We've seen our value scores continue to improve. And every external survey that we've looked into, we've seen that data strong as well from a value proposition standpoint. And then as Tricia spoke to earlier, no trade-down, no check management.

So again, thinking more in the terms of the dynamic of the challenging hurdles, the launch of steak, as well as what you've seen across the industry in consumer discretionary of the headwinds that consumers are facing in general. So nothing that we've seen structural and if anything, more confidence in the structural strength and long-term trajectory of the business with the health of our NROs and the consistency, no matter if it's Nashua, New Hampshire; Burlington, North Carolina; Plantation, Florida; recently opened in Pittsburgh, only gets us more excited for the white space opportunity in front of us.

Next question is from the line of Danilo Gargiulo from Bernstein.

Danilo Gargiulo

I have 2-part question really. First of all, Tricia, as you're thinking about your guidance for the second half, I mean, you were saying in the second quarter, same-store sales were impacted by the steak lapping. So as you're looking in the second half of the year, how much of the guidance is actually derisked? Or are you expecting to see another potential revision in terms of your expectations on the steak lapping?

And then the other question I have is a little bit more general and looking in 2026 and beyond. I mean I'm trying to understand how you're thinking about the potential benefit that might be coming from the One Big Beautiful Bill in terms of accelerated depreciation and interest deductibility in terms of the accelerated unit growth that you might be seeing in 2026 and beyond.

Tricia K. Tolivar

Yes. So to your first question regarding the lapping of steak and how we think about the rest of the year, certainly, what we are -- what we saw in the second quarter was the trial period for the introduction of steak, of which we have passed. So as we go into Q3 and Q4, we're excited about our robust culinary innovation pipeline with chicken shawarma coming in the next few weeks as well as the introduction of cinnamon sugar pita chips. Pita chips are becoming a very strong platform for us for flavor innovation, coupled with other enhancements to our loyalty program. So lots of things in the pipeline that drive same-restaurant sales, and that's what gives us confidence in how we think about the business going forward and the trends we're seeing today.

Regarding your question regarding the Big Beautiful Bill implications, one of the biggest things is ironically around income taxes. And certainly, there's some benefits that we will experience that will push out our use of NOLs for another 2 years. So that's certainly something that's very helpful from a cash perspective. But really navigating changes in -- and this isn't really to your specific question, but changes in the tariff situation are very fluid. They're happening all the time. So as we think about going into Q3 and Q4, there are

some very modest tariff impacts as some of our products are sourced from countries that have been impacted. All of that has been captured based on what we know today. It's been captured in our guidance.

But there isn't anything -- other significant items. We are very excited about our ability to continue to invest in new restaurants. The team has done an outstanding job navigating tariffs, both on the supply chain side as well as the design, development and construction side so that we're not anticipating material changes at all in our ability to grow and continue to leverage those robust new restaurant openings that we've been experiencing.

Your next question is from the line of Andrew Charles from TD Cowen.

Andrew Michael Charles

Just one clarification in the near term. What do you attribute to the July improvement? You spoke about 2-year trends improving, but I'm curious if this is just easy comparisons. Or did you see the 3-year trend also improve? And the bigger picture question, though, is that this dynamic of strong year 1 sales volumes in '24 and '25 that leads to a lower new store maturation tailwind, does that lead you to think that long-term same-store sales will be closer to low single digit as you'll be facing this embarrassment of riches really. I mean it's a good problem to have. But -- or do you believe in the next few years, with the playbook that you outlined, that you can execute closer to your mid-single-digit track record?

Tricia K. Tolivar

Yes. So regarding your first question, what do you attribute the improvement in July to, it's really the lap of steak. Steak was launched at the beginning of June. And so after we get through that lap, that helps accelerate the business, but also coupled with making sure we're delivering and enhancing our guest experience, being very relevant in the cultural conversation itself, and as Brett talked about a little while ago, continuing to test and optimize from a media mix modeling perspective. So those are the factors that helps contribute to the acceleration after the lap of steak and then bring us into Q3 as we move forward.

Now regarding long-term same-restaurant sales growth, I appreciate your color on being very fortunate to be in this place and driving outsized returns early on. We're going to keep a very close eye on it and continue to update. There isn't anything about the business that causes us any concern. And we'll continue to focus on those restaurants in the upcoming quarters, give you updates.

Operator

Next question is from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair.

Sharon Zackfia

I guess I wanted to ask about the assistant manager addition. So Brett, can you talk about how that's planned to be rolled out? And is that more of a human resources pipeline building initiative? Or is there something you're seeing in the restaurants that you really want the assistant managers to focus on to elevate operations?

Brett Schulman

Yes. Thanks, Sharon. It's a little bit of both. We will start the rollout in November and through the course of the following 6 months, ramp up to staff roughly 2/3 of our restaurants with the AGM position. And what we're seeing is -- you talk about the 3-year comp, you talk about when we went public -- right before we went public, I think our year 1 AUV model was $1.9 million then it went to $2.1 million. We recalibrated to $2.3 million. We have restaurants -- the whole class is now trending above $3 million.

And these restaurants are doing significant high volumes, and we want to make sure as we always have, that we continue to invest in our team, invest in the business and the guest experience and put that support in the restaurants so that we now have more seasoned leadership and a second manager. We have GMITs in many restaurants, but this is a more experienced position that helps support not only the general manager and the leader, but to create more balanced shifts and greater support on nights and weekends and has the -- also the double impact of building and deepening our pipeline to have role-ready leaders to support our new restaurant openings.

So we're very excited about this. And again, we always are looking operationally to stay in front of the business and how we can continue to invest in our guests and in our team. And this just gives a stronger leadership complement, especially in our high-volume restaurants.

Operator

Your next question is from the line of Andy Barish from Jefferies.

Andrew Marc Barish

Can you talk to the 2Q mix? Part of the comp component looked a little bit lower, maybe a little more promotional activity or something going on during the quarter. And then looking forward with chicken shawarma, do you expect that to be at a premium price versus chicken items on the menu, so maybe a little bit of a mix driver there?

Tricia K. Tolivar

Yes. So as we looked at mix, we didn't see significant changes overall. So we talked a little bit earlier, premium attachments are consistent with what we've seen before. Also seeing increases in pita chip attachment overall. As we think about chicken shawarma, that will have a premium price, not at the same level as steak, but it will be a premium price and does come with a little bit of a higher cost as well because its hand stacked and marinated and processed for our restaurants overall.

But -- so -- and then you asked about promos. Really weren't highly promotional. We saw others trying to buy sales in the quarter, and that isn't something that we're going to do. We don't want to discount our brand. What we're focused on is the long term, continuing to do the things Brett talked about and investing in team members and guests and bringing CAVA to more and more people across the country.

The next question is from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.

John William Ivankoe

I wanted to revisit the question on marketing, if I could. Now that you've crossed the $1 billion of trailing system sales, congratulations on that, what kind of marketing opportunities could potentially open for you? In other words, I mean, are there platforms or services or other types of reach that you can now have or at least have more frequently now that you're getting to be and have the visibility to be an even bigger company? That's part A of the question.

And part B, it's -- competition in a market like New York, but I'll just choose that one, is notably evolving and changing, I would even argue, increasing in a lot of trade areas who clearly want your customer base, your customer occasion. Could you comment on competition of whether there are pockets where you've seen short-term impact and how you've typically done with that impact over some series of months or quarters?

Brett Schulman

Yes. John, in regards to competition, it's no different today than it's always been in the restaurant industry. What are you doing to have the people, the guests walk by the 3 restaurants next to you to come in and share a meal with you as opposed to your competition? And that ebbs and flows, but it's always been there, and it's always our job to make a more compelling relevant experience for our guests and value proposition for them. And we haven't seen anything in the New York market, in particular, that's different from any other market across the country. And we have not seen any specific pockets of weakness certainly related to competition.

On the marketing point, that is a lever we absolutely have to be able to pull that we have not pulled to date in a meaningful way. We certainly have culinary innovation. We have the long secular tailwinds of Mediterranean in the category that we dominate and define. So we have had these great tailwinds fueling us for the last few years, and marketing is another lever to pull at the appropriate time. And as you said, crossing $1 billion in revenue, we are starting to get scale in certain markets where we have a scaled enough restaurant base that it can start to make sense to amortize and leverage those investments across those markets.

And certainly, things like -- we've tested CCTV, over-the-top, certainly outdoor and some upper funnel activity. We still see paid being highly efficient, effective, lower funnel, and we've done some tests in the quarter to lean into that a little bit and understand the efficacy of it. So that's absolutely a lever we'll look to pull at the appropriate time and something that hasn't been embedded in our comps to date.

Operator

Your next question is from the line of Brian Mullan from Piper Sandler.

Brian Hugh Mullan

Wanted to ask what you said in the prepared remarks about Hyphen. Maybe just talk a little bit about how that came together. What makes you think that technology could be an attractive option for CAVA? And just kind of related to that, as you move to the pilot that you mentioned, what are the key things you'll be watching? Just talk about what success looks like short term and long term there.

Brett Schulman

Yes. We've been speaking with the team for a few years now. We've looked at a lot of different automation companies. We are familiar with the space. We have a lot of automated equipment in our manufacturing facilities, our pneumatic fillers. And what -- we like the approach of the Hyphen team and the progress that they've made. And we look at it, again, as how do we make our restaurants easier to run, how do we free up our team members to deliver human connection. And when you look at our channel, our multichannel experience, one of the biggest opportunities we have is digital order accuracy. And we know that on the digital channel, our guest priorities are convenience, speed and accuracy.

And this is where automation can come and deliver that on behalf of our team members and help our team members and alleviate some of the labor requirements on those second make lines to free that labor component up to be able to interact with our guests, be in the dining room, be on the main serving line in the restaurant and delivering that human connection. So we see it with a couple of benefits and second-order benefits of making our restaurants easier to run, delivering better, more accurate, consistent guest experiences and allowing us to reallocate labor to deliver that great Mediterranean hospitality.

Operator

The next question is from the line of Jon Tower from Citi.

Jon Michael Tower

Maybe just kind of following that same thread in terms of the tech investments you had mentioned, Brett, earlier in the call with respect to KDS or the AI camera. I'm just curious if you could -- I still -- I understand it's still in test for many of them, but is there any chance you could quantify what you're seeing with respect to store profit improvements with those technology in the stores? And then as you're thinking through using those or rolling those out to the store base, do you expect to take some of the savings that you'll generate and use that to fund the AGM investments in the stores over the next 12 months or so?

Brett Schulman

Jon, the kitchen display screen system is in 95 restaurants today. It will be in 270 by the end of the year. And we are seeing improvement in accuracy and productivity in some of these restaurants. We haven't quantified it to date. But when you think about the kitchen display screen system, the TurboChef ovens, which are now in 188 restaurants, it will be in all restaurants by the end of the year, again, this makes our operations easier to use. We are seeing guest improvement scores. And then the AGM position in the test pilot, we've seen this role, in a sense, be self-funded with some transaction growth we've seen, having that stronger management -- manager complement across all shifts throughout the 14 daypart, 7 lunch and 7 dinner.

Operator

Your next question is from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays.

Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein

Just a question on the margin and earnings flow-through. The 2Q upside, despite the comp shortfall, I assume that -- well, the comp shortfall probably caught you by surprise in June. But the fact that you were still able to beat those expectations pretty handily, just hoping to get your kind of bigger picture thoughts on over-earning. Maybe there's an opportunity to reinvest in the system. Maybe there are some areas that could help drive sales long term, whether it's in value or labor hours. It just seems like an operator's dream to have the upside that you're seeing to margin and earnings to potentially reinvest or whether you feel like these are levels that you want to stay at, and therefore, there isn't as much incremental opportunity to reinvest in the system.

Tricia K. Tolivar

Certainly, in the quarter, the strong NRO performance contributed to our ability to manage the lower-than-expected same-restaurant sales. I will also call out that at these AUVs, it's easier to manage disruptions or less than expectations from a sales perspective. And the team does a remarkable job in acting with agility and really adjusting the business as they keep a close eye on it each and every day and each and every week. So those things combined certainly contribute to it.

And then regarding reinvestments, we're always looking at the business to make reinvestments and -- back in the team member or in the guest. And in this quarter, we didn't have outside investments that we made, but we're still able to deliver on our expectations from a restaurant-level margin perspective and adjusted EBITDA that we contributed.

Operator

Next question is from the line of Dennis Geiger from UBS.

Dennis Geiger

Just another one on the strong new store opens [indiscernible], if I could. Any additional commentary on kind of what year 2 could look like, how the algorithm could change? Or is it just too early given the strength you're seeing across these recent cohorts. I guess more importantly, as you think about this dynamic, which is a strong issue or whatever the right word is to have, do you contemplate what you do to support that year 2 performance, whether it's marketing or something else? Or again, is it really just a function of that really strong year 1 and then you don't worry too much about how to support that year 2 on these stronger cohorts?

Tricia K. Tolivar

Yes. So when we look at the 2023 cohort and how they're performing in year 2, they're outpacing our expectations from a cash-on- cash return perspective and delivering at a 50% cash-on-cash return. And as I mentioned, the 2024 cohort is delivering at above 40% cash-on-cash returns, which was what we thought they would do a year from now. And so looking at those restaurants, it's a combination of higher sales performance as well as better-than-expected restaurant-level margins in those restaurants with a very stable CapEx investment. So I don't see that changing very significantly. And the dynamic is we're just accelerating and pulling forward those good -- that good value and that investment return for us.

Do I want -- I will continue to look at it and we will work and share more information. At this point, we're not going to revise anything. We believe that opening year 1 at $2.3 million and growing 10% makes sense. And then when you perform above that, we naturally would have to think that, that might be a pull-forward that you'd have to reflect appropriately.

Operator

Your next question is from the line of Brian Vaccaro from Raymond James.

Brian Michael Vaccaro

Just back to the Q2 comps, I think you said no regional differences. But curious if you're seeing any differences from a daypart or day of the week perspective. And as it relates to sales transfer and as you build out existing markets, I'm curious to what degree that might have increased and maybe having a greater impact on comps.

Tricia K. Tolivar

Yes. We are not seeing any shifts in daypart, seeing consistent performance between urban, suburban and specialty markets, saw a slight increase in our digital mix, partially driven by delivery, but more so by in-restaurant pickup. There really isn't anything that stands out overall. And when we think about sales transfer, that's a natural part of our growth and development. And what we find is that when we do open restaurants and there's some sales transfer, 1 plus 1 ends up being 3, which is what drives continued value. And the strength we're seeing gives us the confidence in that white space opportunity and for us to be at least 1,000 restaurants by 2032.

Operator

Your last question is from the line of Eric Gonzalez from KeyBanc.

Eric Andrew Gonzalez

I wanted to ask about throughput. Maybe perhaps you could speak to any metrics you're willing to share. And do you think there's an opportunity to capture more of the excess demand as your stores develop that muscle memory over time?

Brett Schulman

Yes. Thanks for the question. We've talked about in the past, we want to be mindful of not pushing our team and our guests too hard, too fast. This is many guests first time experiencing Mediterranean, certainly experiencing the CAVA brand. And we've seen some of that negative impact in some of our peers that have overly focused on it. Having said that, we want to make sure guests aren't frustrated getting through the line and that the long lines we have in our restaurants don't intimidate folks from coming in and getting their CAVA meal.

So we are working to support our team to help them naturally do that, whether that's our kitchen display screen system, whether it was the new labor deployment model we rolled out late last year. And we do track it internally, and we do track at peak, are they using the proper labor deployments and complement of hours. And we are seeing improvements where the teams are adhering to those disciplines. So we continue to work with them. And then as I talked about the AGM test, the assistant general manager test, having more seasoned leadership across all shifts is also an opportunity to drive improved speed of service and transaction growth as we roll that program out. So very focused on striking the right balance as we are in brand building mode and growth mode and many guests first time experiencing us, but also mindful of not having the lines be too long and frustrating other guests.

Operator

Thank you very much. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call over to CEO and Co-Founder, Mr. Brett Schulman, for closing comments. Sir, please go ahead.

Brett Schulman

I want to thank everyone for joining us today. Before we wrap, I want to take a moment to share my gratitude for our entire team. Just days ago, we celebrated our 400th restaurant, a milestone that reflects how far we've come and how deeply we remain rooted in our mission to bring heart, health and community to food.

As summer draws to a close, we're also mindful of the recent floods in Texas and the many lives impacted. Our thoughts are with those affected, and we remain committed to supporting our communities. Through meal donations to first responders and local residents, we're reminded that nourishing our communities and showing care are at the heart of who we are. Thank you for your time and support, and we look forward to continuing this journey together and speaking with you next quarter.
