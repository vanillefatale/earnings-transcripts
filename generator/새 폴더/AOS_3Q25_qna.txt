Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.

Saree Boroditsky
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Maybe just building on some of the China color. You obviously lowered expectations around China sales. Could you just talk about your performance versus the overall market there? And is this just a weaker market or is there any competitive dynamics going on?

Stephen Shafer
President, CEO & Director

It's a little bit of both. So the market continues to have its challenges and as I mentioned, there's been a little bit of a pull-forward demand driven by the government subsidy program. So we're on the other side of that. And I think within that down market the competitive intensity continues to increase. So we see a lot of promotional activities trying to step in where government subsidies were playing a role to generate demand previously. And so that's adding to the competitive pressure. And I think, as we see our path forward, as I mentioned, we've got confirmation that our brand remains very strong there. We have a really strong innovative portfolio to serve our customers, but we need to work through this period of challenging market conditions.

Saree Boroditsky
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Appreciate that. And then obviously, one of the bright spots this quarter was on the North America commercial water heater sales. I think previously you attributed some of the strengths to prebuy. So just maybe just a little more detail on what you're seeing in that market and what's driving the strength there.

Stephen Shafer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's been a strong market condition for commercial products, but I'd also say we have a really strong portfolio in that space. And I mentioned on the last earnings call the launch of our Flex commercial water heater, and -- so we've got that out in the marketplace that I think is performing very well. So it's a combination of a really strong market backdrop, but also in an area where we've got really competitive product offering.

Charles Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

And I would add that during the third quarter we benefited from our production efficiency program to make sure that we were level loading a bit closer to the market. And some of that strength we saw in commercial and residential heater was a part of the output of that benefit in the level loading program.

Our next question comes from Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer.

Bryan Blair
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Just to level set on the China strategic review. We know there isn't a timetable as of now in terms of the ultimate decision, but given the insights from the assessment so far, has the range of potential outcomes been narrowed in any way?

Stephen Shafer
President, CEO & Director

No, Bryan, not yet. I mean we're still early enough in the process that we're not ruling out any outcomes at this point. So like I said, we've done some really good work just trying to profile and understand the market. We've gotten some third-party assessment to do that. We've started the process of reaching out to other participants, which is why we wanted to announce that we were putting the business under the strategic assessment. But we're not at a point yet where we kind of narrowed down or have a view of what the outcome of that is yet, still too early.

Bryan Blair
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Yes. Understood. Appreciate the color. The priority channel growth in North American water treatment certainly encouraging in Q3, and that 11% nicely aligns with the 10% to 12% organic growth target you've put out at Investor Day. With mix now reset for the platform, is that kind of organic growth in play going forward?

Stephen Shafer
President, CEO & Director

I mean that's certainly how we think about the business long term. I would say there's still more work to be done, right? So we've done some reprioritization of the channels and where we think we can be competitive and win. I think there's still more work and investment in that space to build out that platform. But we feel good about the growth potential of that business.

Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Jeffrey Hammond
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Just on the U.S. resi water heater market, I think you didn't change your industry shipment assumptions but seemed to lean a little more cautious. So I just wanted to understand a little bit better how you see that playing out.

Charles Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Our outlook for the industry, we were talking about flat industry on our last call. And now, we're saying flat to slightly down. So we do see a little bit of pressure on the residential side. Most of that is coming through new home construction completions on the residential side that we're seeing some of that weakness. So we've taken it down just a tad.

Jeffrey Hammond
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

And are you seeing kind of the market share recapture play out as you thought?

Stephen Shafer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. As we were looking at level loading our production this year, we've seen our performance relative to the market in Q3 come back and gain share back as we expected.

Jeffrey Hammond
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then just -- I think you mentioned some additional tariff headwinds, maybe quantify or talk about where you're seeing that. And then just as you look at steel pricing and kind of forward tariffs into '26, how does that kind of inform pricing actions you need to take into '26? We're seeing -- we're hearing from kind of other channels that maybe next year is another above average increase. Just wanted to get your view there.

Charles Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. This is Chuck. I mean, the mention on tariff pressure was really framing from third quarter to fourth quarter, it's probably maybe 20 basis points on North America margins where we were seeing a bit heavier tariffs kind of accumulate. Our full year outlook at 5% has not changed. So still a little bit of timing, putting a little pressure on the North America margins in the fourth quarter. We'll be back in January, giving a little bit of an outlook on costs. The tariff world is a bit volatile, so I think we'll kind of hold off commentary to see where material costs go in that respect.

Operator

Our next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird.

Michael Halloran
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Could you talk a little bit through what you're seeing in the residential side of things in terms of the discretionary spend? I certainly heard the commentary earlier that some of that weakness that -- or incremental weakness you saw on the residential volume side from an outlook perspective is tied to new housing starts being a little bit lower, no surprise. Are you seeing anything different on the discretionary piece?

Charles Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

We really haven't seen that change. We do a survey every quarter, and we look at proactive replacement, as you know. And if we kind of look at that survey, there's quarters where it edges up, edges down, but overall it's still above that 30%. Proactive replacement remains pretty resilient. Certainly something we'll watch as we go forward. But -- it's a backwards, it's the last trailing 12 months survey. So we'll have to continue to watch that and make sure we understand if there's a trend developing. But right now, still above 30%.

Michael Halloran
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

So -- and then following up on Jeff's other question, I know you're not giving '26 thought process, but if trends were to play out and you weren't going to get any incremental actions, the pricing that you've taken in your mind is enough to make you price-cost positive or at least be price-cost neutral on the margin line or in terms of EBITDA dollars, once kind of all the catch-up happens. Is that the thought process? Or is there still going to be some gap relative to what you're seeing from an inflation perspective with the actions you've already taken?

Charles Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. When we do our price increases, and it really was no different other than the amount of the price increase. This time with the tariff costs hitting us, we typically look to cover margin plus cost. So just a reminder, the last one was second quarter that was effective. When we announce those prices, they go out and certainly we see pressures over time on the price and we have a bit of a fade. So I think we're kind of still reserve kind of the answer to that as we get into the next quarter, but we're comfortable with our price-cost relationship now. But as you'll see there's some pressure when you look at our guidance and a little bit of pressure on margins in the fourth quarter.

Operator

Our next question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs.

Charles Perron-Piché
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

This is Charles Perron in for Susan. First, I'd like to go back on the China market. Understanding the market conditions are tough, but I guess do you have any thoughts on potential additional restructuring initiatives in the region given the environment and something that would be done ahead of potential strategic announcements?

Stephen Shafer
President, CEO & Director

I think it's one of the things we're going to continue to work through and learn more about as we go through our strategic assessment. And I kind of alluded to the fact that there's opportunities for us as we think about how we go to market our business model. We're going to continue to evaluate those things. Whether we do those through partnerships or we do them for ourselves, it's something we still have to work through. But our goal is to make sure that the business is set up well for success and obviously a little bit of market recovery will help aid that in a bit. But we're going to continue to kind of learn from the changing market environment and make the necessary changes. And whether that comes through things that will take on and self-help to do that or whether that's done through partnerships is one of the things we're assessing right now.

Charles Perron-Piché
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful color. And then I think in your prepared remarks you talked about the potential for strategic acquisition within your or adjacent market. I guess, on this, can you talk about what is the pipeline for these types of opportunities in the current environment along if the timing of any strategic decision on that is dependent on the potential announcement of the strategic review on China?

Stephen Shafer
President, CEO & Director

No, I think one of the strengths we have, right, is a strong balance sheet and our cash generation capabilities. So we've got an active pipeline. We continue to evaluate that from kind of a strategic lens, financial lens, where we want to go next. And as I mentioned, partly it's how do we strengthen the core of our business, how do we think about building new higher-growth businesses, and we're going to continue through that process. So I don't think it's connected to other decisions we're making across our portfolio at this time. And we're ready to move, I think, when the right opportunities come about.

Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.

David S. MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

I wonder if you could give us an -- I was wondering if you could just give us an update on gas tankless and the progress to date on relocation, manufacturing and market development and just the impact on third quarter margin contribution and maybe the implied fourth quarter, which you've got in the '25 guide.

Stephen Shafer
President, CEO & Director

Sure. As you know, we've made a big investment to enter with our own products into the gas tankless space. We've been building out the right set of products, the manufacturing capability here in North America and all of that is progressing well. I think the market itself for tankless is under pressure, heavily connected back to the residential construction market that we talked about. So from that standpoint, it remains kind of a challenging market. But I think we're really excited that I think we've got the right products, we've got the manufacturing capability ready.

As we've talked about in the past, we've made some changes. In the past, we were talking about launching in China, moving to North America. We've made some changes into that strategy, which has made some delays to their current plan in terms of how we're going to go after the market. But I think we're happy with where we're at. We'd like to move faster in the marketplace, and I think as the market picks up and recovers, especially around new construction and with the product offering we have and the supply chain we have, we'll be ready to compete successfully.

David S. MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

Are you getting good feedback -- sorry, go ahead.

Charles Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

I was just going to answer the question on margin pressure. It's -- we're anniversarying when we first launched the product last year, so the margin pressure is a bit less than the 40 basis points we had historically talked about. For the quarter, it's probably about 20 basis points. It's not overly significant. And I think you were asking about feedback.

David S. MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

Yes. I was just going to get you to talk a little bit about what you're getting back from the marketplace and people, I know that you are undertaking a phased launch on that product in terms of just incremental models and is the acceptance level relatively good at this point or are people waiting for the full assortment? Just any commentary on that would be helpful.

Stephen Shafer
President, CEO & Director

Yes, folks love the product and when they get their hands on it, and they get comfortable with it. And as you know, we've been building out our portfolio. So when we have the full portfolio, we'll be even more compelling. There's also elements of how we serve this market, right? A lot of more gas tankless tied to the new construction. So we're working out on the business model as well. But I would say, at the end of the day, the product is a market-leading product, and that's what we looked to do when we got kind of our own product offering into this space.

Our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel.

Adam Farley
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

This is Adam Farley on for Nathan. Wanted to follow-up on -- I wanted to follow-up on the China commentary. I know fourth quarter is typically a seasonally stronger quarter due to the shopping holidays. So what is your expectation for the selling season going into the fourth quarter balancing that with some of the headwinds you guys are seeing there?

Charles Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

Well, you're exactly right. It's typically the fourth quarter is one of our strongest quarters in China. Our outlook assumes that there is an uptick in volume in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. But I will say when you kind of frame our outlook for China overall to be down 10%, you'll note the fourth quarter gets a little more pressure on year-over-year comps compared to the third quarter. So without the -- with the discontinuation of the subsidy program, there's a bit of uncertainty in China on how the fourth quarter may play out. But right now, we have kind of normal cadence, but not at normal volumes. But just kind of relative to the third quarter, we do see a bit of an uptick.

Adam Farley
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

That's helpful. And then maybe shifting to boilers, which was a bright spot in the quarter. I think you mentioned maybe you think there's a little bit of prebuy there, but I was also wondering if the boiler sales cycle is maybe elongating at all due to general market uncertainty or maybe that's not an issue at all.

Charles Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

No. I mean, we do believe that there was some prebuy, so there is certain boilers that, I'll call it, inventoriable size. They're small enough that you'd be willing to invest and put them in inventory. We've seen a couple strong quarters in boilers. Typically, our strongest quarter is the third quarter. So we do think we'll see a little bit of headwind as we go into the fourth quarter for some of the unwind of the, call it, inventoriable boilers that will come out in the fourth quarter. But overall, the market quoting remains pretty steady, pretty consistent, particularly on the large CREST units. So we're not seeing any major change or elongation in what I would say quoting to the order cycle.

Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.

Andrew Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Steve, obviously you've had good operating experience in your past positions. Maybe just stepping back as you've looked at AOS and given how many of your markets are relatively sluggish, how have you sized the potential opportunity for cost out overall at AOS and/or the potential to accelerate new product-related growth as you begin to transition into '26?

Stephen Shafer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Andy, so as I've mentioned, 2 of our priority areas are A.O. -- the operational excellence and how do we get more out of the A.O. Smith operating system and innovation. I think that gets after both components of your question. I think -- we don't have a good sizing yet of what the value is at stake on that, but what I'll tell you is I'm encouraged by the fact that we can bring even more kind of discipline into our operating rhythm at A. O. Smith.

I think we have great manufacturing capability, and we run a lot of our business with great people with a lot of experience and I think bringing some discipline. And I mentioned Chris Howe joining us as our CDIO. I think discipline and leveraging some of the technology investments we've made is going to be a meaningful opportunity for us. And we haven't kind of framed that in numbers yet. We're sort of building the foundation that we can build on and I think that's something we will continue to talk to you all about going forward.

And then on the innovation front, we also have a new CTO and one of the things we're really focused on is how do we kind of increase the pace and success of our commercialization capabilities and -- across our businesses. And so that's another area of focus. And again, we're kind of putting the foundation in place. But we've got a great history at this company of breakthrough innovation, creating categories and so tapping into that culture of innovation is something that's another big priority for us.

Andrew Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. And maybe just a little more color on inventories across your resi channels, anything you're seeing there? Obviously, resi HVAC is having much more difficult time than resi water heaters given their own inventory problems over there. Doesn't seem to be the case with you guys here, but what's the risk given weaker consumer confidence that we could see some destocking?

Charles Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

Right now, I would say we think that inventory is in the channel on both residential and commercial side is at pretty normal levels, pretty much target levels. As there's hesitancy, maybe on new home construction, you may see some of the distributors looking to be very prudent on how they manage inventories in the back half of the year. But we feel like channel inventories are pretty much where they should be right now.

Our next question comes from Tomohiko Sano with JPMorgan.

Tomohiko Sano
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

My first question is on CapEx. Could you talk about the CapEx guidance compared to 3 months ago, including what kind of items like did you revise for the full year, please?

Charles Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. We've lowered our CapEx outlook just a little bit. We pushed out some of the investments that we had planned for the fourth quarter of this year into early next year. Some of those, not all of those were related to just watching the DOE commercial regulatory initiatives out there, and we're just being prudent on making those investments until we have more surety around that.

Tomohiko Sano
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And my follow-up is capital allocation. So you have been aggressive with the buybacks and dividend increases, how do you prioritize capital allocations going forward, especially if the macro headwinds persist, please?

Charles Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

I mean, certainly, the dividend is very important to us. We've raised it for 32 years. We look at that from a yield perspective, and we feel pretty comfortable with where we are at on that. Buybacks, we're framing really to not grow cash, which we're buying back a prudent amount we believe to not grow cash and still reserve firepower for acquisitions. So as Steve mentioned, we have adequate firepower. We're looking for adding those acquisitions, and we're in a good position to do that.

Stephen Shafer
President, CEO & Director

And I'd say in terms of market conditions and how they change, we still recognize we need to deploy capital to our core business, and we have a very resilient core business from that standpoint. So making sure that we maintain a very strong core business that's cash flow generating is in that dynamic as well. And at the same time, we're looking to how do we provide more adjacencies that get us into kind of higher growth businesses.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Scott Graham with Seaport Research Partners.

Scott Graham
Seaport Research Partners

I'm sorry for jumping on late, balancing several conference calls. So I missed your prepared remarks. Was sort of the lean into the -- I should say, the reduction to the lower end of the guide range for the year, was that on China exclusively because it looks like the North American items are fairly flat versus last quarter? Was that China? Or was it something else?

Stephen Shafer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Scott, there were 2 things we pointed out. There was obviously the softness, and we did revise down our China outlook for the year to down 10%. So that was a big part of it. The other thing we've highlighted is weakness on the residential side of the North America business, and we just see that a little bit softer now. Where previously we talked about it as a flat market, we now see it as flat to slightly down. So those 2 components are what have us being a little bit more cautious.

Scott Graham
Seaport Research Partners

Okay. And I'm sorry for having to ask that was something you already said. Does that presuppose that or maybe contemplate that the October industry shipments were better than September because September really dropped off there? Can you kind of talk about what you're seeing in the industry in October?

Charles Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

Well, the industry shipments, August really was down quite a bit on the residential side. We think September will be -- not similarly down but was also weak. And as we think about kind of our orders, and maybe that's where we can comment in October because we haven't seen any industry data yet for October. But in October, as we look at our orders, we haven't seen resiliency, particularly on the wholesale side, which is generally more influenced by new home construction. So it's been a bit weak overall. So those all kind of -- all those factors come into play, Scott, when we're thinking about flat industry last quarter, now flat to slightly down. We just see a little bit of pressure, particularly on the new home construction.

Stephen Shafer
President, CEO & Director

And we've talked about our approach to kind of level load our production a bit more for the efficiency benefits of that, working closely with our customers to do that. So we saw Q3 where the industry was down a bit, but we also gained share as was our intention as we walked through the quarter because of the way we level-loaded our production.

Operator

I would now like to turn the call back over to Helen Gurholt for any closing remarks.

Helen Gurholt
