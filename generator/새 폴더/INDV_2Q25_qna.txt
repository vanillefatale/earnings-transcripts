Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions] And the questions come from the line of David Amsellem from Piper Sandler.

David A. Amsellem

Just got a couple from me. First, Joe, you've talked in the past about prioritizing gaining traction in patients who are commercially covered. Can you talk about that opportunity and how you're thinking about balancing that versus the core Medicaid population that comprises the bulk of the SUBLOCADE business. That's number one.

Number two is, can you talk about the criminal justice system channel? I didn't see it in the slides. Your predecessor talked about it a lot. So where does that fit in, in terms of overall strategy?

And then lastly, I wanted to ask you about your thoughts on R&D spend going forward. I know there's some strategic decisions to think about. But this is a commercial stage business and there is quite a bit of R&D spend. So how are you thinking about prioritizing or not prioritizing R&D in the context of all the other priorities that you've outlined commercially?

Joseph J. Ciaffoni

David, thanks for the question. I'm going to do it in reverse order because I'm going to hand the commercial question off to Pat. So first off, with regards to R&D and our medical affairs organization, we're going to be working through what will be a significant reorganization of those functions. Importantly, I'm pleased to be able to report by the end of this year, both Indivior 6001 and 2000, we believe will be fully enrolled, and we'll have the opportunity to hopefully read out that data by the end of the first quarter of 2026.

When we think about the R&D organization moving forward, we want to make sure we're maintaining the capabilities from a development perspective to be able, if successful, to transition those programs into Phase 3. As it pertains to the criminal justice system, what I would say is the criminal justice system is an opportunity in our view of which we'll continue to be focused on. As you know, in the first quarter, as a result of coming off formulary in the Federal Bureau of Prison, we absorbed pressure, all of which manifested in the first quarter. We've seen stability. So we view that as a new start point within the criminal justice system upon which we will focus on growing.

I think the important thing when people think about SUBLOCADE is that they focus on the overall opportunity that we have, whether it be in commercial, Medicaid, criminal justice system, and it's really abundant in keeping in mind that LAI penetration is just under 8%. So we're very excited about the potential growth opportunity for SUBLOCADE, and we view it as an enduring growth asset for us. And I'll hand it off to Pat to talk about commercial.

Patrick A. Barry

Yes. Thanks, Joe. We're certainly not deemphasizing the Medicaid channel. I mean the Medicaid patients deserve an OUD treatment. And essentially, we have demonstrated success in terms of converting those patients and getting them activated to treatment. However, when we look at the commercial opportunity in our covered lives, we -- there's about 60% of our covered lives are commercial patients. And yet when you look at the SUBLOCADE volume, it only represents 25%. So we want to continue to focus on Medicaid as a channel, but those commercial patients also deserve SUBLOCADE, those who are suffering from OUD.

So our focus is going to be on capitalizing on that as well. That's a sales force focus in terms of messaging, making sure our customers are fully educated on coverage. And it also is an opportunity for us to make sure that, that specialty pharmacy channel is effective and efficient. So those patients once prescribed can be activated.

And the questions come from the line of Chase Knickerbocker from Craig-Hallum.

Chase Richard Knickerbocker

Congrats on the excellent quarter, guys. Maybe just first on guidance. Have we seen anything so far in July that points to further kind of price compression on SUBOXONE kind of backing into the second half, you need to model a pretty decent volume or price decline. And then just on SUBLOCADE along the same lines, is there any reason kind of with all the strategic programs you put in place that SUBLOCADE would not kind of grow sequentially? Again, second half of the year, it looks like guidance assumes that there's probably a little bit of a sequential decline in Q3. I mean just some thoughts on kind of product drivers there as it relates to top line guidance.

Joseph J. Ciaffoni

Sure. So Chase, I appreciate the question. With regards to our guidance, what I would say to you is we haven't seen any signs of additional price erosion with SUBOXONE Film, although we are factoring that into the guidance right now. To the degree that doesn't manifest, that would be a positive. And when you think about SUBLOCADE, what I would focus you on is on a demand basis, the SUBLOCADE guidance does incorporate growth in the back half of the year. We are very encouraged by what we're seeing from a fundamental perspective, inclusive of demand in July, but we have a lot of work to do in front of us to achieve it, but it does assume sequential growth on a demand basis.

Chase Richard Knickerbocker

Got it. And then just 2 more, if I could, Joe. First, on the Action Agenda. Any thoughts on kind of the magnitude of what the bottom- line kind of cost savings benefit would be from kind of streamlining the business? And then along those same lines, should we expect that kind of any changes from streamlining the business would be in effect by year-end 2025, and so their kind of be a full year benefit from either being able to reshift those costs or drop them to the bottom line in 2026?

Joseph J. Ciaffoni

Yes. So Chase, I appreciate that question. With regards to the Action Agenda, I'm not going to give any color at this point in terms of giving a number or a target. That's not how we've approached it. We're focused, first and foremost, on making sure we're making every investment necessary to maximize the potential of SUBLOCADE in the U.S. And then we are focusing diligently on simplifying the organization and removing all nonessential spend. I believe when we get to our third quarter call, we'll be able to give a perspective of what that looks like, and then it will be fully captured in our guidance. What I do want to address head on in the question you're asking, we are not dabbling around the fringes. We are addressing the core of the cost structure.

So people should have an expectation that it is a meaningful and significant reduction to the overall cost structure. And we will have everything or near everything implemented where we will have a full year effect. And what people should expect is growth of SUBLOCADE. But right out of the gate, those dollars dropping to the bottom line in January of 2026.

Chase Richard Knickerbocker

Understood. And then just lastly, Joe, your predecessor gave some thoughts around kind of where they think market share would stabilize out with your competitor with SUBLOCADE. I mean do you have any thoughts as you've kind of become familiar with this market as far as kind of how you think kind of long-term market share shakes out and kind of over how long a period, we kind of get there?

Joseph J. Ciaffoni

Yes. So I appreciate that question. From my perspective, the single most important thing when you think of SUBLOCADE on a going-forward basis is long-acting injectable penetration. The answer to what the peak sales of SUBLOCADE will be, will not come down to what the market share of SUBLOCADE is. Now in saying that, what I will emphasize that we're very encouraged by because certainly, from a competitiveness perspective, in particular, with our commercial team, it's a very important metric. We have now seen for multiple quarters stabilization of market share from a total perspective, and we've also seen that from a new patient share perspective, and we're seeing it at a total in the mid-70s, which we're very encouraged by.

And the final comment I would make is we are very confident in the profile of SUBLOCADE along with physicians' knowledge and empirical experience that its market position is going to pan out just fine.

And the questions come from the line of Dennis Ding from Jefferies.

Yuchen Ding

Congrats on a very solid quarter. Just one question for me on cost cuts. Is it reasonable to assume that you'd like to align your SG&A spend as a percentage of revenue to be more in line with industry peers, which is, I think, around 30% of revenue. Is that a fair way to think about it and how you're thinking about it, too, which if so, would imply about $200 million cut in OpEx just from SG&A over time?

Joseph J. Ciaffoni

So Dennis, I'm going to hand that one off to Ryan.

Ryan Preblick

Dennis, thanks for the question. So first, there's no doubt that our #1 priority is generating the momentum behind SUBLOCADE. But our organization is too complex, and our cost structure is too high for a company of our size. So we are currently assessing the entire organization from top to bottom as we speak with 2 focus areas. One is to make sure that we are fully resourcing SUBLOCADE to generate that momentum behind it.

And then second, to only fund programs and activities that are essential. All nonessential spend will be dropped to the bottom line. In regards to what exact number we want to get to, listen, let us work through this over the next couple of months. We will be in a better position over the next couple of quarters or so to start sharing some of that. But we do believe that as we get into 2026, we will see the benefit from this work.

[Operator Instructions] And the questions come from the line of Thibault Boutherin from Morgan Stanley.

Thibault Boutherin

First question is just a clarification on stocking and the gross net dynamic for SUBLOCADE in the quarter. Just on stocking, is it a normalization towards a normal level after the previous destocking? Or do you expect a reversal of this in the second half of the year? And gross to net, if you can explain to us a bit in more detail, is it the dynamics here, is it a mix effect, is it sustainable, is it going to reverse? So that's the first question.

And the second one is just if you could sort of elaborate a bit on the previous market headwinds we saw during 2024. CGS budget, I think it's clear, but the Medicaid is enrollment and any headwind in terms of the Medicaid, is it something that's over and you should assume that the environment is now more favorable and it's just sort of execution and organic growth? Or do you still see any sort of headwind in the Medicaid enrollment or Medicare -- total number of patients on Medicaid, sorry?

Joseph J. Ciaffoni

Okay. Thank you, Thibault. I'm going to hand the first question on stocking over to Ryan and then come back, and I'll address the Medicaid question.

Ryan Preblick

Thibault, yes, so in Q2, the stocking impact was minimal. There's always going to be some ups and downs through the year. But at this point, we project it to remain relatively stable for the balance of the year.

Joseph J. Ciaffoni

Okay. And then with regards to your question on headwinds, I really can't speak fully to the past. What I can tell you is that we see opportunity and tailwind in front of us. Certainly, there are dynamics within Medicaid in the U.S. that are taking place. But from a big picture perspective, we're encouraged that the opioid epidemic, opioid use disorder seems to be a bipartisan topic. We certainly advocate for coverage for everyone who is qualified along with access to treatments and appropriate care for OUD. I would be mindful that when you think of Medicaid, the changes being proposed don't start to be implemented until 2027.

And there's consideration as it pertains to people who have OUD and substance use disorder as an example, where they're not going to be held to the work requirement. So the big picture when you think of SUBLOCADE is it's about the abundant opportunity in front of it. There's an 8% LAI penetration, whether you're talking Medicaid, whether you're talking commercial, whether you're talking the opportunity in criminal justice system. We are confident this year through operational execution of our commercial team that we will generate momentum. We will be doing the assessment and making the decisions of where we're going to invest to drive LAI penetration to accelerate the brand on a going-forward basis.

And the questions come from the line of Carl Byrnes from Northland Capital Markets.

Carl Edward Byrnes

Congratulations on the quarter. I'm wondering, going back to the commercial opportunity and considering that you're around 25% and you have 60% in terms of BMAT therapies and 80% patient outreach conversion with the DTC initiatives that are going to come into place, what do you think is a realistic expectation long term in terms of getting closer to that 60% number? Where do you think it may ultimately land?

Joseph J. Ciaffoni

Yes. So Carl, I appreciate the question. First, to be clear, we have 60% of covered lives within commercial. We do not expect to set expectations commercial ever to be the contributor that Medicaid is, but we do believe that we certainly should be getting more than 25% contribution from the commercial book of business. So we want to see that number moving upwards, but I wouldn't have an expectation that it's ever on par or anywhere near the level of what we're deriving from Medicaid, but it should be meaningfully higher than it is.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We have no further questions at this time. I will now hand back to you for closing remarks.

Joseph J. Ciaffoni

Thank you, operator, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we execute the Indivior Action agenda.
