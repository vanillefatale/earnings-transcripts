Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

Brian Nowak
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

The first one maybe for Philipp or Sundar. It's on agentic e-commerce and agentic travel. There's a lot of external Wall Street discussion about agentic e-commerce potentially monetizing at a lower rate than search. So the question is what factors are you most focused on to sort of ensure a smooth transition for your search business and for your advertisers as you move over to a more agentic world?

And the second one, Sundar, is on Waymo. How far are we from an integration of Waymo into more of the core Gemini capabilities and the users on the platform taking your user data of where I'm going, what hotel I'm staying at, what airport I'm staying at and having integrated that into Waymo? If you can actually have users use their profiles to pre-schedule Waymos, how far off is that? What do we have to do?

Philipp Schindler
Senior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google

Brian, great question. This is all early, but we see agentic experiences really as additive to the way people seek information. It helps us answer people's tough questions. It helps us -- it helps people get stuff done, and it helps businesses in the process. And we're working on multiple agentic experiences across key verticals such as travel, commerce, shopping and so on, and we're paying a lot of attention to creating a seamless user experience but also to the fact that we need to integrate different partner ecosystems in a way that it creates value for them.

And by the way, we're also working closely with a lot of our partners on the other side through our cloud services to improve their own agentic experiences. And so maybe we go a little deeper on the shopping side where we actually use AI already very actively to improve the shopping experience. As you know, we launched a more visual experience on AI Mode. That gives people a much more intuitive conversational way to shop. You can simply describe what you're looking for now like the way you talk to a friend, and we'll show you the visual shopping results.

And then we think about building an agentic shopping future and it has to be one, again, that benefits both users and merchants here. And you know that AIO, we also introduced new agentic checkout, which will let shoppers use like agentic AI to buy products from merchant sites and so on. We have a partnership with PayPal to help merchants build agentic commerce experiences. We have a new open protocols for agent-to-agent transactions and so on and so on.

Sundar Pichai
CEO & Director

And Brian, on Waymo, a great question. I was reflecting, I think, on the exact same topic. I'm scheduled to meet with the team to do a review on it in a few weeks out. Look, it is an exciting time. Waymo clearly is scaling up, particularly in 2026. And I think the possibility, as you said, of Gemini, particularly with the multimodal experience as well as services like YouTube, I think there's a real opportunity to make the in-car experience dramatically better. Definitely something we are excited about, and you'll see newer experiences in 2026 for sure.

Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.

Douglas Anmuth
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Philipp, maybe you can just talk more about some of the drivers of the core search strength. And I guess, in particular, when you think about AI Overviews and AI Mode, we know that query growth is accelerating. But can you help us understand from there kind of what happens in terms of clicks per query and conversion rates and pricing in these AI-driven search formats?

And then, Anat, can you talk about where you see opportunities in the core cost base as you look to make room to absorb the rapid growth in infrastructure and depreciation going forward?

Philipp Schindler
Senior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google

So let me give you a bit of vertical color first. In Q3, Search and other revenues again delivered growth across all major verticals, as we said, was from retail and financial services. Health care was also a contributor to the growth here. Our new AI experiences, you mentioned the AI Overviews, AI Mode, continued to drive growth in overall queries, including commercial queries, really creating more opportunities for monetization. AI Overviews is scaling up and working for our entire user base. We're now scaled to over 2 billion users here, and we're continuing to expand ads in AI Overviews in English to more countries, across desktop, mobile and so on. And as I've shared before, for AI Overviews, even at our current baseline of ads below and within the AI's response, overall, we see the monetization at approximately the same rate.

So over time, we're excited about the opportunity of richer experiences in AI Mode and AI Overviews to basically open up then the opportunity for also much richer placements. And I think as I've said on a prior call, we manage the business to drive great outcomes for our users and an attractive ROI for advertisers. We don't really manage to paid clicks and CPC targets. But as you will see in the 10-Q, paid clicks were up 7% year-on-year and CPCs were up 7% year-on-year.

Anat Ashkenazi
Senior VP & CFO

Doug, and to your question around where else can we see more opportunity for efficiency and productivity, and I think you heard me say before, this is not a onetime type of effort but rather an ongoing way in which we manage the business, and the key here is that the more we drive productivity across our business, the more we can invest in the business for growth and obviously continue to drive improvement in the P&L.

Some of the areas are things that you've heard us talk about in the past such as moderating the pace of head count growth, optimizing real estate footprint but also as we invest more and more in our technical infrastructure, ensuring that we are optimizing that build-out and the overall technical infrastructure we have that a lot of the data centers, for example, that we build ourselves, so they're optimized and we make sure we do them in the most efficient way. Sundar mentioned on one of the previous calls the productivity associated with leveraging AI for Google. So this -- the example, the percent of code, now nearly half of all code generated by AI, that's a way for us to leverage AI to drive further productivity across the business.

And obviously, we always look at making sure that when we provide services or products that we get the right economics and the right value for what we provide. So the one good example is Shorts, which has a lower revenue share than in stream that helps to improve some of our gross margins. So this is an effort. We have ongoing -- I've mentioned in the past that we have a headwind with depreciation, obviously, increasing alongside our CapEx increase. So we're -- we have efforts across the organization to ensure we run the business in the most disciplined and productive way while continuing to invest for future growth.

Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.

Eric Sheridan
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Maybe 2 if I could. Sundar, when you think about your custom silicon efforts across the organization, can you reflect a little bit about the opportunity set you see with each passing generation of custom silicon both in terms of driving operating efficiencies inside the organization and potentially increased monetization efforts around those outside of the organization?

Second question would be for Philipp. Obviously, we could see the YouTube advertising revenue number in the reported results. Can you reflect little bit about the scaling of the subscription side of YouTube offerings and how the 2 parts together maybe represent an interesting framework in thinking about the monetization side of YouTube increasingly being a mix of both ads and subscription?

Sundar Pichai
CEO & Director

Eric, overall, I would say, we are seeing substantial demand for our AI infrastructure products, including TPU-based and GPU-based solutions. It is one of the key drivers of our growth over the past year. And I think on a going-forward basis, I think we continue to see very strong demand, and we are investing to meet that. I do think a big part of what differentiates Google Cloud effectively, we are the -- we have taken a full -- deep full stack approach to AI. So we are -- and that really plays out, right? We are the only hyperscaler who is really building offerings on our own models, and we are also highly differentiated on our own technology. So to your question, I think that does give us the opportunity to continue driving growth in operating margins in Cloud as we have done in the past. And also, I think from a revenue, sets the infrastructure portion of our business to be a growth driver looking ahead as well.

Philipp Schindler
Senior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google

And to the second part of your question, look, just taking a quick step back, we often describe YouTube's business as a flywheel. Obviously, it, first of all, starts with the creators, and we have significantly invested here to be the place that YouTube creators really call their home. That's a big piece of it, the #1 piece. Viewers, of course, YouTube has billions of monthly logged-in users and every day, people watch billions of hours of video. And we talked about how our recommendation systems are driving robust watch time growth and so on and so on.

So on the monetization side, YouTube's business is really powered, I would say, at, let's call it, a twin engine monetization strategy, combining its advertising business and its growing subscription services. Both YouTube ads and subscription saw strong growth this quarter. And so looking at YouTube Music and Premium, users are, on average, delivering more value to creators, to music, media partners and YouTube itself than even ad-supported users do.

So in other words, on average, a YouTube Music and Premium subscriber generates a meaningful higher gross profit than they were simply an ad-supported users. Fans come from all over the world. You know this and this engagement through ads and subscription generates YouTube's revenues and funds what I started with, these creators here and this then drives more viewership and engagement and so on. And that's the flywheel. And so our priority continues like this growth cycle. We're happy with this twin engine monetization strategy.

Our next question comes from Mark Shmulik with Bernstein.

Mark Shmulik
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Sundar, with the strong adoption of Gemini, AI Mode and Overviews across the user base, are there any meaningful differences to call out kind of around the behavior and depth of engagement for those users across the entire Google ecosystem. And then, Philipp, I know we kind of asked this most quarters, but I'm curious kind of what some of the adoption you've seen around AI Overviews and Mode, how you see the economics of search evolving with the higher commercial and total query volume and how it kind of compares against the incremental cost to deliver these results.

Sundar Pichai
CEO & Director

Mark, look, I think obviously, AI Overviews are a natural part of the Google experience, and so engagement is very, very high. I would say AI Mode, you have varied cohorts that are people who are casual users, who are checking it out. And then -- but there's a core group, which really likes AI Mode and is passionate about it, and so you see the early adopters. The product is resonating very strongly, and they are seeking it out. So I think that's how I would highlight the difference.

With Gemini, again, a set of engaged user base who are seeking out the product and so on, but across the board, I think the trajectory has been we are definitely seeing in each of those use cases, a set of early adopters and then more people coming in and the people who are using it continue to use it more over time and report high user satisfaction. So I would say the underlying product metrics are pretty encouraging to see as well.

Philipp Schindler
Senior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google

Look, into the second part of your question, I think we covered before -- Sundar covered the query development. And as I've just said before, for the AI Overviews, even at our current baseline of ads, right, whether above, below and within the AI response, overall, we see the monetization at approximately the same rate. And this is a great baseline for further innovation. We talked about this. We're excited about where this can go.

And on the AI Mode side, we're testing as an AI Mode, and we'll continue to test and learn before we expand this any further. So that's in combination with what we mentioned about the commercial query overall development. I think we're in a good place here. You could also argue that on queries, that historically have not been well monetized. We think there is a potential opportunity here where you can obviously imagine that we can build this out with smart AI integration.

Operator

Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.

Michael Nathanson
MoffettNathanson LLC

I have 2, 1 for Philipp, 1 for Anat. Philipp, it's clear that when people use AI Mode, the query length is much longer. Could you talk about how that longer length may be impacting your ability to drive ROAS and what you're seeing in terms of some of the early -- the benefits of maybe longer query length?

And then, Anat, you came to Alphabet from a pharmaceutical company. You've been there more than a year. Can you talk a bit about how you're working to look at ROIC internally? And what early signs are you seeing that gives you confidence that the spending is really driving better returns longer term?

Philipp Schindler
Senior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google

Look, as Sundar shared, AI Mode now has over like 75 million daily active users in the U.S. and we see a strong and consistent week-over-week growth in usage since launch, and the queries doubled over the quarter. And as I also mentioned, we're testing ads in AI Mode. We'll continue to test before we expand any further. It's really too early to tell and go into any of the details of that testing.

Anat Ashkenazi
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And the question related to ROIC and how we look at just overall our business and where do we see early signs that are encouraging, so first, I would say it's not just early signs because we're seeing returns, obviously, in the Cloud business. You've heard us talk about the fact that we already are generating billions of dollars from AI in the quarter. But then across the board, we have a rigorous framework and approach by which we evaluate these long-term investments that are meant to do 2 things. One is to ensure we have -- we built a resilient growth profile for the company, but also that we meet the demand of the customers that we have here in the more near and midterm.

So we look at it across the business. We evaluate the potential return for each one of them whether it's in Cloud, and I think that's more visible, obviously, externally given that you see the revenue generated and the fact that we're unable to meet, at this point, customer demand. We have more demand than we have supplied. In our ads business, you see the fact that we're investing to transform search, as you heard from Philipp and Sundar, with AIO and AI Mode. So we're excited to see what our investments are -- how our investments are helping advertisers as well; YouTube, where it's helping power recommendations.

So we're -- when we make a decision on investment in the long term, we go through a very rigorous process of assessing what the return could be and over what time frame we will see that return to give us the high level of confidence to then invest and make those investments for the long term. So it's a very rigorous approach.

Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays.

Ross Sandler
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great. About 20% of Google's search queries are commercial historically, and you've talked a bunch on this call about how AI Overviews are kind of expanding the breadth of queries. Could you talk about how new products from the monetization side, like AI Max, are potentially increasing the percent of commercial queries?

Philipp Schindler
Senior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google

So look, AI Max, and I mentioned this in my call before, improves the ability for advertisers to target a wider range of queries. Separately, there is the question of whether queries actually increase with AI Mode, and Sundar actually talked about it and mentioned the opportunity that he sees here. So I think it's important to separate those 2 things. And I personally also see this, what I just said in my last remarks, that I think, over time, there's an opportunity to actually take, let's say, queries that are not fully commercial but could have an adjacent commercial relationship to basically expand this into more attractive ads offerings without -- while really creating a really interesting user experience at the same time.

Sundar Pichai
CEO & Director

Yes. And the only thing I would add is just stepping back broadly, I think AI Overviews and AI Mode are dramatically improving search. We can see it in user satisfaction, user quality, all our metrics, and they're universal in the nature. They apply across the universality of human needs. So I think we are seeing it in breadth. And so naturally, over time, that will apply to commercial categories as well.

Our next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo.

Kenneth Gawrelski
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Two questions, please. First, it appears more and more clear that all the new modes -- Google with Gemini Overview -- AI Overviews, AI Mode, even ChatGPT is growing the addressable market for engagement and search-like behavior. Could you talk about what gives you confidence that it will also grow the addressable market for marketing activity and overall revenue associated with that behavior? That's question one.

And question two is just more about as you think about AI Mode, AI Overviews and traditional Google Search, how do you think -- do you see a world in 12 to 24 months, those all will exist? And does the user eventually pick what mode they want? Is -- does the algorithm pick the mode? Can you talk a little bit about how you think that will progress over the next 12 to 24 months?

Sundar Pichai
CEO & Director

Ken, thanks. Look, I think it's a dynamic moment, and I think we are meeting people in the moment with what they are trying to do. Obviously, search is evolving, and between AI Overviews and AI Mode, I think we are able to kind of give that range of experience for people in this moment. Over time, you will expect us to -- you can expect us to make the experiences simpler in a way that, just like we did universal search many, many years ago, we may have done text search, image search, video search, et cetera, and then we kind of brought it together as universal search. So you will see evolutions like that, but I think we want to be sensitive to making sure we are meeting the users in terms of what they are looking for.

I think Gemini allows us to build a more personal, proactive, powerful AI assistant for that moment. And I think having the 2 surfaces search in Gemini allows us to really serve users across the breadth of their needs. And -- but over time, we will thoughtfully look for opportunities to make the experience better for users.

And to the first part, I would broadly say, as I do think we've been consistently saying for a while now, this is an expansionary moment, and we are seeing people engage more. And I think when they do that, naturally, a portion of that information for users, those journeys are commercial in nature. So I would expect that to play out over time as well.

Our last question comes from Justin Post with BAML.

Justin Post
BofA Securities, Research Division

Great. Just a couple. Sundar, I think you mentioned Gemini 3 is coming. Maybe you can comment on the pace of innovation in frontier models. Is there still just a tremendous amount of innovation? Or is it slowing at all? And then you mentioned a number of large deals signed in the last 9 months for cloud, which is great. Any changes in the economics of these deals as far as long-term profitability? Anything we should be aware of?

Sundar Pichai
CEO & Director

Thanks, Justin. The first on the on the pace of frontier model research and development. Look, I think 2 things are both simultaneously true. I'm incredibly impressed by the pace at which the teams are executing and the pace at which we are improving these models. But it also is true at the same time that each of the prior model you're trying to get better over is now getting more and more capable. So I think both the pace is increasing, but sometimes we are taking the time to put out a notably improved model, so I think -- and that may take slightly longer. But I do think the underlying pace is phenomenal to see. And I'm excited about our Gemini 3.0 release later this year.

On cloud, I would point out as a sign of the momentum, I think the number of deals greater than $1 billion that we signed in the first 3 quarters of this year are greater than the 2 years prior. So we are definitely seeing strong momentum, and we are executing at pace. And in terms of long-term economics, I would say that, again, us being a full stack AI player and the fact that we are developing highly differentiated products on our own technology, I think, will help us drive a good trajectory here as you have seen over the past few years.
