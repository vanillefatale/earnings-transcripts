[Operator Instructions]

And our first question will come from John DeCree with CBRE.

John DeCree
CBRE Securities, LLC, Research Division

I'm sure we'll talk quite a bit about Las Vegas, but maybe to start with your decision to exit New York. Obviously, it was such a focus of your for a while. Bill, I know you gave some prepared remarks, but curious if you could elaborate. Was it just investment sizing, you put out a press release, but anything else you could kind of tell us there? And then my follow-up with the swing in liquidity. How should we think about MGM's kind of return hurdles for investment going forward with New York didn't quite pencil out?

William Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Sure. look, there wasn't originally a concern with -- and I think most of you know this, between ourselves and resorts, we basically had a guarantee to -- whether we did the tax or not, we had to make whole on the education fund, we had to make whole for the horseman. And ultimately, we struck a deal with the city of Yonkers, which meant we would have had a minimum tax of about $400 million. So that was our first hurdle. We knew that, but that remained a large hurdle.

As we then began to understand the landscape that particularly as it's looked more and more where the competitive set would land, it put further pressure on the deal further pressure on the numbers. And I think the thing that concerned us probably the most was at the end when we thought we were buying for a 30-year license and were told it was 15 and it was done after we've made an original submission that was concerning because if not for that, then what else. And so while we initially liked the return, it got tighter and tighter so much so that given overall market conditions, we think it's capital best spent some other location and some other opportunity.

Jonathan Halkyard
CFO & Treasurer

And John, it's Jonathan. On your second question in terms of our return thresholds. I mean, given present circumstances with our share price, our return thresholds are pretty darn high. I mean we can capture free cash yield, just in repurchasing our own shares. I don't have the math in front of me, but it's probably 25% or 30%.

One investment we're very excited about is our project in Japan. And despite Sarah's great efforts in securing this yen-denominated facility, which will get us through next summer, we'll be investing in that project in late '26, '27 and '28. But this is a project that we think probably has the most favorable supply-demand dynamics of any integrated resort. So we're very excited about that project.

Otherwise, we're being -- we scrutinize our capital investments very closely, the growth capital investments that we have opening shortly in Las Vegas, like Carbone Riviera, Gymkhana, and the rest, we think are going to drive very nice returns for us. But we have a high return threshold right now as compared to simply buying our own shares.

John DeCree
CBRE Securities, LLC, Research Division

And Corey, congratulations on your retirement. It's been great working with you over the years. Congratulations.

Operator

Your next question will come from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.

Shaun Kelley
BofA Securities, Research Division

Also I'd like to offer my congrats to Corey, and we enjoyed working with you Corey, so thanks for that. So if I could just build on the last question a little bit around -- sort of the high ROI threshold, Jonathan, that you mentioned. I think the question we get over and over again is, obviously, I think we know the trajectory of land-based gaming in the U.S. we think a lot more about the growth in digital that you're experiencing. Does the turnaround -- and so there's going to need to be a balance at some point between value today and a lower cost of capital but -- or a higher cost of capital, but growth that you could achieve looking to a digital future.

So just trying to kind of get your current sense on how you -- how you kind of prioritize or balance that? And just sort of your thoughts on doubling down on digital given, I think, the stability we've seen from the BetMGM team, obviously, lending itself to being able to return some capital to you.

Jonathan Halkyard
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Thanks, Shaun. The interesting thing is right now, our digital investments are cash generative as opposed to cash consuming. We're in a very much a growth mode in MGM digital as it relates to our BetMGM brand expansions over in Europe and in Brazil. But the kind of the core LEO Vegas business together with, of course, BetMGM and North America are both generating now pretty substantial cash flow for us. So it's not requiring a digital investment. And as it relates to other additional investments in digital, we're really just focused on growing the existing businesses we have right now as opposed to doing any kind of inorganic growth.

Shaun Kelley
BofA Securities, Research Division

And then just as my follow-up, obviously, throughout the prepared remarks, you guys weathered pretty challenging Q3 environment. A lot of talk about Q4 stabilization as the group calendar comes back. F1 sounds encouraging. So just can you help us kind of put it on a spectrum of what -- like we hear stabilization? Is that getting better sequentially? Is that potentially flat in the 4Q? How much better could it be? Or do you really need like a bigger group calendar like we expect to see in Q1 to potentially see some growth in the Vegas segments just given some of the calendar issues that you're up against in Q4?

William Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Shaun, I'll kick it off, and obviously, my colleagues will pile on here. It has been sequential. Obviously, July for everyone in the community was a rough month. The summer was rough, but it sequentially got better. I will say the same about October. Knock on wood, we may even beat October of last year. And recognizing the fourth quarter last year was like an all-time fourth quarter.

So all that being said, F1 does feel good. Leisure activity is there, we obviously can generate through value. We saw it with a fabulous sale. We literally doubled the bookings in that particular week. So we feel better about it. There's a lot out in front of us. The FAA in its considerations with the government shutdown may or may not have an impact. It has not, to date, thankfully. But there's no precursor to what that will mean for the next 6 weeks or so.

But I think overall, we feel positive. There's a couple of weeks in December with leisure that is a hole that we need to -- we want to continue to push on to see how we fill. But sequentially, we feel better. And we use the word stabilization not lightly. We think we can get there.

Next question will come from Brandt Montour with Barclays.

Brandt Montour
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Just starting off in Macau, the stats you gave for October were really impressive, obviously, implies share gains, and you gave the share number. But some of your peers have been more aggressive recently and they've been sort of public about that. And I know the EBITDA is there for you, you gave that for the month of October as well. But have you had to change your strategy at all? And is that sort of imputed in the share numbers that you have here?

William Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Kenny, why don't you take that?

Xiaofeng Feng
President of Strategic, CFO & Executive Director

Yes. Okay. This is Kenny. Thank you for your question. Actually, competition is not new to us at all. We see rational competition in the market that operates like a folks -- operators are focusing on like offering quality products and bringing in excellent services for Macau visitors.

For MGM China, we -- as we always said, we are focusing on understanding our customers like conducting CapEx project and improving our services to refresh and fine-tune experiences for our premier customers. For example, we have fully launched our Alpha Villas and Alpha Clubs clubs and the Fantasy Parks at MGM side. There is no such competitive products in the Macau peninsula market. These products, the key that these products truly reflect our understanding of our customers, they are well received. Like Macau market in January looks pretty optimistic for October.

But for MGM China, we believe we anticipate we will deliver one of the strongest months in terms of GGR and the EBITDA performance at our company's history. So currently, what we are focusing on is we are focusing on the effective projects. Like on Cotai side, we are trying -- we are doing like we are converting 160 rooms to 63. Majority of them are 2-bedroom suites.

So construction has started. We targeted to complete in the first half of next year. We believe these 60 suites will cater to the evolving taste of our customers And we are also developing some other high-end gaming place. places at MGM Cotai side as well. We hope we can utilize this our advantage, which is our deep concerning our customers. We are acting quickly and to maintain our market share in the mid-teens in Macau.

Brandt Montour
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. That's great color. And then back domestically, you guys had a saving programs of about $150 million. Some of that was taking price in certain areas. And I was hoping you could give a refresh on that program and sort of if you've had to sort of change things around, given some of the consumer awareness of prices in Las Vegas and if that was something that had to be adjusted and how you're faring there?

Jonathan Halkyard
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. We are kind of deep into that program now. In fact, most of the actions, the vast majority, let's say, over 90% of the actions that we set out really about this time last year are complete. And I would say -- and I don't want to speak for Corey or Bill, but in my opinion, there's really nothing we would have done differently on the -- kind of on the customer value side than what we did.

In fact, many of the things that we did were in response to what we were hearing from our customers and the kinds of things that they were and were not willing to pay for. A lot of our activities also were in just the daily blocking and tackling of labor management and procurement and those types of things as well. I certainly wouldn't undo any of that because I don't think they in the end really had a customer impact.

William Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

And just maybe a more global view on the whole value. Look, we lost control of the narrative over the summer. I think we would all agree to that in hindsight. When we look at the $150 million, we think about resort fees and park fees and some of the other things that were fee-based inside that number, those have remained as and in place. When we think about pricing and things that got everyone's attention, whether it's the infamous bottle of water, where a Starbucks Coffee Excalibur cost $12, shame on us. We should have been more sensitive to the overall experience at a place like Excalibur to those customers. You can't have a $29 room and a $12 coffee.

And so we've gone through the organization. We think we hope we believe and we price corrected. I think the sale that the community did and we participated in a meaningful way, demonstrated we understand value, we understand Las Vegas and we'll always be that. We'll always need to be that. And so I think we've positioned ourselves for that, and we'll continue to do so going forward.

Next question will come from Dan Politzer with JPMorgan.

Daniel Politzer
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I was wondering if we could talk a little bit about Las Vegas through the lens of the high end and low end. Bill, you mentioned luxury properties, record slot handle there, and then kind of juxtapose that with Excalibur and Luxor. Have you seen maybe a widening in the performance between these segments of your portfolio? And if so, kind of what are the adjustments or levers you can make going forward to kind of keep everything on the growth path?

William Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

I think the core answer is yes. I don't think that's unique to us or our industry for that matter. But yes, look at Bellagio, ARIA, Cosmopolitan have continued to maintain rates, continue to maintain ADRs, generally speaking, in a tough environment. When you lose 400,000 seats in a marketplace over the summer, principally around Spirit and Spirits of value or airline that speaks to a marketplace that we potentially lost. When you think about what's going on in the country and you think about Southern California market, heavily Hispanic, I think our drive -- I don't think I know our drive traffic was down in the summer.

And so that had presented and continues to present somewhat of a challenge. You think about international visitation in Canada. And while we're all trying to do things to make that better, I don't think that's going to go away anytime soon. And obviously, that's really across all of our marketplaces, the international piece, but it also impacts, I think, to a degree, for sure, Luxor, Excalibur, which is the 2 properties that we struggled here in Las Vegas the most. I don't know, Corey, if you have some more color.

Corey Sanders
Chief Operating Officer

Look, I think you look at the Bellagio, it seems to be -- you wouldn't know anything was wrong with it. We're able to fill the hotel rooms. The gaming volumes are high-end players is where it has been in the past. Weekends for everywhere, we were able to get occupancy. Rates sometimes a little more challenged than it was last year, but still we're able to fill the hotels. And this midweek when the convention base is not here, it's really Luxor and Excalibur, that probably have the biggest challenges of occupying rooms.

Daniel Politzer
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And then this is a higher level one for Bill or Jonathan, whoever wants to take it. Obviously, there's been a few deals on the M&A front lately that you guys have been involved in, but I guess can you just talk about the appetite for a more diversified cash flow stream as you think about the things that you're seeing in your portfolio now? And obviously, the balance sheet is in good shape right now, but if something did come across your plate, what are kind of the thresholds we should think about that you guys would kind of go to kind of take advantage of that?

William Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Well, I'll talk about 40,000 feet, and Jon I can think about the actual threshold. Diversification, we've been saying it all along is key. We think we have the opportunity, given our scale, scope, breadth and knowledge to participate in many pieces of this marketplace. We think we do best when we're creating things that are at the highest end. And I think a lot of the recent things we've done in Macau proved that to be the case. I think ultimately, what you'll see in Japan will prove that out to be the case. We are obviously in the digital business in a big way, the combined businesses next year will probably do $3.5 billion top line. And as we've said, time to tell bottom. All that said, diversification is key.

We have a large Las Vegas concentration which we understand and we manage to and -- but we will continue to look. I mean, obviously, right now, the value of our stock, you just -- I mean, when we're trading under 3x for our core business, not to continue to buy back our own stock. It doesn't make -- it makes all the sense in the world to us for today, but I'm sure the market because it always has, will readjust itself and other opportunities may come up.

Jonathan Halkyard
CFO & Treasurer

I think, our -- one of the pretty things about the performance of MGM China, for example, and BetMGM, and we expect MGM Digital as our company is becoming more diversified rather than less as those relatively smaller businesses grow at very high rates. With respect to M&A activity in the regional markets, between Goldstrike and Tunica, over $100 million EBITDA business, Northfield Park over $130 million EBITDA business. These are big businesses, but yet they are ones that we don't think have the growth to represent the scale of the regional portfolio that we aspire to have. So it's a pretty high bar for us to look at any additional regional properties. They have to be, of course, of the quality consistent with our brand, but also of a scale, and they're just in any market that we're not in. So it's a pretty high bar for regional M&A, I would say.

Next question will come from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel.

Steven Wieczynski
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

So what ask is the strip leisure recovery question maybe a little bit differently. So if we think about the next couple of months and fully aware, the booking window is a little bit tighter right now. But are you seeing a major difference in the booking patterns for that FIT visitor between your different properties. You talked -- you touched on this a little bit, Bill. But meaning is demand at Bellagio, Cosmo, ARIA, whatever you want to think about it, all really strong and you aren't seeing the same thing at the other properties like New York, New York, Luxer, et cetera? Or moving forward, are the booking patterns starting to become a little bit more similar across all your assets there?

Corey Sanders
Chief Operating Officer

I think the luxury booking patterns are similar to what they've been in the past. The core is -- and the legacy properties are booking a little bit differently. So where we used to book a ton of that in 30 days, we're seeing some of that book out a little further.

Steven Wieczynski
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Got you. And then, Jonathan, to your last kind of remark there. If we think about the rest of your regional portfolio now after the Northfield sale. Just wondering how you view the rest of your regional assets at this point, meaning would any of the remainders be for sale? Are they all for sale at the right price? Just any high-level thoughts there about kind of rightsizing the rest of that regional portfolio would be helpful.

Jonathan Halkyard
CFO & Treasurer

That's a top question with my CEO sitting right next to...

Unknown Executive

I mean, sure, I guess, at some price, all properties are for sale. But I would say that our regional portfolio right now, they represent pretty much in every case, market-leading properties with very nice importation into Las Vegas. Most of them very important BetMGM omnichannel locations as well. So we like that regional portfolio a lot.

William Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And of the 7, 5 of them, our market leaders that they dominate anywhere from 25% to 47% of market mix in those particular -- the markets that they serve. And so we think of them, whether it's Borgata or the Bow in Mississippi as highly representing our brand well, market leaders independent of anything else we do, they stand on their own and they do quite well.

Obviously, to Jonathan's comment on digital, it's important in most -- all of those states. A couple of them are not. Obviously, we've talked about New York. And so how to think about that long, long term, time to tell. But one day at a time, we've just come off of the -- we're not going to push forward for today in New York.

Operator

Your next question will come from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley.

Stephen Grambling
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just want to follow up on Dan's question, but perhaps from the opposite angle. You talked about the undervalued nature of the stock. So what do you view as the primary levers or path that you could pursue to unlock value from here? And I know you referenced diversification, but is there also a path of simplification to consider? And if there are, what do you think is the kind of the lowest hanging fruit as we look across China, BetMGM, digital or otherwise?

William Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Let me kick it off and then Jonathan be -- obviously, digital and the unlock over time of BetMGM is something that we'd contemplate and that's not a surprise to anybody on the call. And so we're constantly talking to our partner about how we can all get the best value of what has been created there, which is a tremendous business. I think that's very real. Look, we enjoy our position in Macau. We particularly as of late. I think the team has done an amazing job there. You all know we own 56.7% of it.

And so we've had a 20-year relationship with Pansy Ho, and so I don't see that changing anytime in the near future. If we can diversify and continue to grow our digital business and obviously, when Japan steps in, it's going to outweigh this, but if we could continue to grow our digital business, it will become more and more of a performer and more and more of what's important to us. But that's probably the place that we most think about diversification.

Jonathan Halkyard
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. And I think it's generating cash flow through our dividend stream from MGM China, now dividends from BetMGM. And then the other thing I'd say is we've, of course, talked a lot about the last quarter in Las Vegas, but we still think Las Vegas is a fantastic market, and we love our position here. We have a better cost structure than we've ever had in Las Vegas. And so with the dynamism in this market, I think that that's an unlock also for the stock.

Stephen Grambling
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

That's helpful. Maybe one quick follow-up since you flagged digital unlock with BetMGM first. Are there any organizational changes or bylaws to consider that need to be thought through as we think about the timing or path?

William Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

No, not really. Look, we have a great relationship and partnership with our folks and friends and Entain. We constantly think about ways to improve that business. But no, there's nothing in that context that we need to unlock it.

Operator

Your next question will come from Barry Jonas with Truist Securities.

Barry Jonas
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

First off, congrats, Corey. It's been a real pleasure working with you over the years. I wanted to start on a strip question on the 2026 group outlook. I know the homebuilders conference is not in town for just next year. But that definitely doesn't seem to dampen the enthusiasm we're hearing for growth. So CON/AGG obviously, returns. But are there other specific large conference call outs you could share so we better understand what's driving the growth outlook?

Corey Sanders
Chief Operating Officer

Yes. Barry, we'd have to look and get back to you on the large conference call outs that I could tell you, our mix is going to be better next year. We're going to have more room nights. First half of the year is going to be extremely strong. First quarter and second quarter will be north of 20% convention mix, which allows us really, not only to fill all of our rooms, but even potentially yield up our rates.

Stephen Grambling
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Understood. Okay. And then just as a follow-up. There have been some talk about increasing promotions in the regional markets. Curious to get your take on what you're seeing there, just in the regions and at the strip, you're seeing anything there as well?

William Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Look in the regional markets -- well, I guess I go back to Kenny's answer, there's always competition. Maryland continues to be more and more competitive as does New Jersey. Look in New Jersey, we've recreated a real differentiator with our product. We've gone in there. We've done all the rooms now what's called the MGM Tower, with the old Water club. We've gone through and redone and have an amazing baccarat area of VIP, domestic VIP. We have a new noodle shop. We have a new BBar, which is a center bar. And so you go in there, it's refreshed. It feels like a new property, and it's really focused on the high end. We've repositioned an aircraft there. So we are doing personalization when it comes to our highest level customers in that market.

And so while we're aggressive, we're aggressive, not necessarily in what shows up in your mailbox, but what shows up with your host. And so we're pushing that high-end VIP extensively there. The other markets continue to be aggressive, and we continue to do what we do. I think the margin in this quarter was 30.1% for regional. So I think it's indicative of our activity case is measured and appropriate. And I think we'll continue to do that.

Corey Sanders
Chief Operating Officer

And we monitor all of our competitors and all of our markets also. And our reinvestment is where we thought it would be and it's fairly close to what it was last year.

Operator

Last question for today will come from Chad Beynon with Macquarie.

Chad Beynon
Macquarie Research

Corey, congrats from us as well on your retirement. I wanted to ask about, I guess, capital in Vegas. So maybe a 2-parter on this. First on MGM Grand. I think the disruption that you outlined today on last quarter's call, ended up being exactly what you had thought. So first question on that, given that, that project is done, should we start to see the ADR increases and some of the returns come in? Or do you maybe have to ease into this a little bit just because of the market softness?

And then the second question that I have on capital projects in Vegas. Bill, I think you teased us before on ARIA potentially being a project in '26. I believe that wouldn't start until maybe after some of the big conventions, but if you could update us on that as well.

William Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Sure, Chad. I'll kick it off. Well, I think we were down for the quarter, 8% in room nights and 5% in AAC. So I think the first real challenge for all of us given the market conditions is to refill those rooms, and we've begun to do that, frankly, occupancy fairly easily and not easily, but I mean, we're in good shape there.

Yes, over time, it will build because the actual product itself is spectacular. I think it exceeded not only our expectations, but the customers who have stayed there. And so I think as that gets out and use of what that product actually is, I think we'll see both AAC and ADR lift over the long haul. We are going to take pretty much the balance of '26 off in terms of room remodel.

And what may be MGM so impactful was we were redoing the bathrooms and plumbing. So we were taking 2 more floors out than normal. So there was always 5 to 8 floors out in any given moment. Normal remodel centers around 3. But we're not going to start the ARIA until November of next year and then really push it into '27 and have the principal work being done over the summer of '27 so we can come out of that seasonality rate to roll and go to the next one, which is -- it's like Golden Gate Bridge in 2028.

Jonathan Halkyard
CFO & Treasurer

Chad, it's Jonathan. We will be, as Bill said, starting that in November, we will incur CapEx right at the end of '26 in the ARIA room renovation, but even so, we expect CapEx to be -- in '26 to be below in 2025. And during our fourth quarter call, we'll give specifics on CapEx guidance for the year.

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Bill Hornbuckle for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.

William Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, operator. And again, I appreciate everyone's recognition of Corey. So Corey congrats and you're making me just. And look, Vegas is fine fundamentally. We feel good about the fourth quarter and particularly going into '26. Macau continues to outperform, and we're excited by that. And we're even more excited by what the digital business has been able to do year-over-year and ultimately where we think this goes. So hopefully, you share some of that excitement, and I appreciate everyone's time today. I know it's late back East. So thank you all.

This concludes our conference call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.
