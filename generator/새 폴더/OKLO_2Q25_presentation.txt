With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jake Dewitte, Oklo's Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer. Jake?

Jacob Dewitte

Thanks, Sam. We're starting today's update by highlighting a wave of federal actions that are accelerating momentum behind advanced nuclear technologies and how Oklo is extremely well positioned to benefit. Over the past quarter, we've seen exceptional policy movement from sweeping executive orders to major legislation and national infrastructure strategies. Together, these actions reflect a coordinated federal push to speed up deployment of advanced nuclear technologies, strengthen domestic fuel supply chains and enhance U.S. energy independence.

For Oklo, this shift is highly beneficial. These aren't just favorable signals, they're concrete steps that support faster licensing, faster deployment and better project economics for first-of-a-kind deployments. The next few slides will unpack the most significant drivers, the executive orders, the One Big Beautiful Bill and the Federal AI action plan, all of which align directly with Oklo's licensing strategy, customer partnerships and long-term cost advantage. The executive order signed earlier this year marked a historic shift in federal policy toward advanced nuclear. These executive orders build on legislation from the last Congress and administration to clearly recognize civil nuclear energy as a national and economic security priority. That designation alone reshapes the policy landscape and unlocks access to key government assets, including alternative fuel materials that do not require further enrichment.

When used in advanced reactors like Oklo's, these material stockpiles could be made into fuel for more than 3 gigawatts of powerhouses. Just as important, these orders direct the DOE and NRC to move faster, streamlining regulatory reviews, reforming reactor testing and targeting 3 operational advanced reactors by July 2026. It's rare to see this level of alignment across permitting fuel access and deployment.

The executive orders go beyond signaling support. They include clear directives that align directly with Oklo's strategy. First, they revitalize the domestic nuclear fuel supply chain with a specific emphasis on recycling. Oklo is one of the few fast reactor companies positioned to use downblended alternative fuel materials, which don't require enrichment. This fuel, combined with the industry- leading advances we are making in fuel recycling can give us a significant structural advantage.

Second, the orders prioritize deployment of reactors at national security locations, including AI data centers and defense sites that aligns with where our customers are heading and where our small scalable powerhouse designs excel. Third, the orders mandate licensing reform, capping fees and setting an 18-month review window for new reactors. That level of regulatory clarity and speed will accelerate Oklo's path to market and strongly supports our combined license strategy. And finally, these orders direct DOE to accelerate reactor testing and target 3 operational advanced reactors by July 2026. That's an aggressive timeline and one Oklo could qualify to help deliver on.

The One Big Beautiful Bill signed into law in July delivers a suite of policy wins that are directly aligned with Oklo's business model. First, it preserves robust investment and production tax credits through 2033 that then phase out through 2036. These credits improve our project economics and offer additional certainty for early-stage deployment. Second, the bill strengthens the loan program's office, establishing the energy dominance financing program. This is important because it provides access to long-term capital for projects that can't yet tap traditional debt markets like first-of-a-kind deployments.

Third, it accelerates NEPA, the National Environmental Policy Act reviews by setting strict deadlines for environmental assessments and impact statements. That helps reduce permitting delays and improves timeline confidence across our project portfolio. And finally, the bill allows for 100% bonus depreciation for assets that begin construction by 2029 and are in service by 2033. That gives us the ability to capture meaningful tax benefits as we build out fuel and manufacturing capabilities.

The federal government's AI action plan also released in July as a major new dimension to the demand landscape for advanced nuclear. The plan calls for a rapid expansion of AI infrastructure, including high-security data centers and resilient domestic energy systems to support them. It explicitly recognizes that achieving AI dominance requires building new sources of reliable, dispatchable power like advanced nuclear reactors.

Our powerhouses are uniquely suited for this use case, delivering distributed baseload power that can be co-located with mission- critical AI workloads. The policy also calls for streamlining permitting, deregulation and expanded workforce training to support infrastructure deployment. As AI infrastructure scales, we expect both commercial and policy momentum behind advanced nuclear to continue building, and Oklo is focused on delivering power solutions that meet that need.

With that context, I'll turn it over to Craig to walk through how our mission, model and design choices are translating into real execution advantages.

Richard Craig Bealmear

Thank you, Jake. Our mission at Oklo has always been clear to deliver clean, reliable and affordable energy at a global scale. Our co- founder started this company with the belief that advanced nuclear could play a transformative role in the world's energy future. That meant rethinking the entire model from how we design reactors to how we license, fuel and operate them. That vision continues to guide us today, and it's now clearly aligned with where policy, technology and customer demand are headed.

Moving to the next slide. Oklo's competitive edge comes from the intersection of 3 key strategies: our business model, our sizing philosophy and our technology. First, we build, own and operate our powerhouses, selling power under long-term contracts. That creates recurring revenue and enables us to move more efficiently through the regulatory process. Second, our small scalable design allows us to deploy assets quickly, match customer demand in an incremental fashion and significantly tap into existing supply chains with factory fabrication, which reduces site complexity, cuts cost and supports faster rollout.

And third, our technology is based on proven liquid metal fast reactor designs with over 400 reactor years of operating history behind it worldwide. That gives us a deep technical foundation with built-in performance and safety benefits. Importantly, it enables us to move directly into commercialization without the need for a costly and time-consuming demonstration plant. And finally, I really can't emphasize this point enough. It provides flexibility for Oklo to use fresh HALEU, recycled fuel and down blended alternative fuel for our powerhouses.

Together, these advantages position us to deploy at speed and scale with a structure built for long-term growth. This past quarter, we made meaningful headway across all elements of our milestone framework from licensing and project execution to field development, customer growth and strategic partnerships. We advanced our NRC engagement, completing Phase 1 pre-application readiness and saw our licensed operator topical report formally accepted for review. We also took another step towards deployment at scale by selecting Kiewit as our lead constructor for the first Aurora powerhouse at INL.

On the customer front, we expanded our pipeline of commercial opportunities with both the Department of Defense and Liberty Energy and advanced our corporate development efforts through agreements with Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power and Vertiv. We also remained disciplined on spend, keeping our cash burn in line with expectations and ending the quarter with a strong balance sheet.

I'll now hand it back to Jake to walk through the progress we made this quarter across our licensing project and commercial front. Jake?

Jacob Dewitte

Thanks, Craig. We continue to make meaningful progress this quarter across our regulatory priorities. We completed Phase 1 of the NRC readiness assessment for the Aurora INL combined license application. The NRC found no significant gaps that would bar acceptance for review, reinforcing our readiness to submit Phase 1 of the application, which we expect to file in early Q4 after incorporating NRC feedback. We also had our license operator topical report accepted for review. This is an important part of our repeatable deployment strategy. It proposes licensing operators by Aurora technology rather than by site. Once approved, this report can be referenced in future applications, streamlining regulatory timelines and supporting scalable deployment.

We're also seeing continued tailwinds across the regulatory landscape. The NRC recently accelerated Terra Power's review timeline by 6 months and introduced new fee reforms, reducing licensing costs through waivers and lower hourly rates. These changes further reinforce the momentum we're seeing and could benefit Oklo's licensing path going forward. And finally, recognizing that there's a lot to track on the regulatory front, we launched a public regulatory dashboard on our website that provides a transparent view of our progress across powerhouses, fuel and radioisotope licensing, helping keep all stakeholders informed as we move forward.

Fuel is one of the most important inputs for advanced nuclear, and it's one of the areas where Oklo has built a significant strategic advantage. Our design enables a differentiated fuel strategy built around 3 complementary sources: access to government stockpiles, commercial supply partnerships and long-term recycling capabilities. This approach provides greater flexibility, cost control and resilience than traditional fuel models.

First, we were awarded 5 metric tons of high-assay low-enriched uranium or HALEU from the Department of Energy in 2019 for our first powerhouse at INL, and we're uniquely positioned to utilize additional government fuel stockpiles made available under recent executive orders, including enriched uranium and plutonium-based materials that don't require further enrichment. These stockpiles, effectively waste materials that would otherwise be destined for costly disposal programs can instead be turned into a productive asset for clean energy by Oklo. Second, we're working with enrichers such as Centrus and Hexium to meet both near-term and long- term commercial HALEU needs. Centrus supports early deployment with available domestic supply, while Hexium's next-generation atomic vapor laser isotope separation or AVLIS enrichment technology could enable lower cost scalable production over time.

And third, our fast reactors can use recovered nuclear material from both today's nuclear fleet and future advanced reactors, positioning us to recycle fuel over time and build a vertically integrated long-term supply model. Together, these efforts form a comprehensive and resilient fuel strategy, one that supports near-term deployment, while building long-term supply independence.

As mentioned, fuel is a critical enabler for advanced nuclear deployment. That's especially true for HALEU, which comes with its own cost dynamics. Enrichment is measured in SWU or separative work unit and so are its costs. Cost of enrichment are actually driven by both ore and enrichment process efficiency. Producing 1 kilogram of HALEU requires roughly 35 to 60 SWUs plus 30 to 50 kilograms of natural uranium depending on market conditions that can create a wide range of cost outcomes.

That said, Oklo's design and business model position us well for this market. We benefit from needing consistent high-volume fuel across many small units. That matches well with enrichment module capacities and allows us to scale demand over time. Smaller cores also mean more units in the field, creating steady annual uptake that supports long-term supply agreements. We're also watching next-generation enrichment closely. Laser-based approaches like Atlas could unlock more cost-effective batch-friendly production over time. Our engagement with Hexium positions us to benefit as that innovation matures.

In short, we're managing HALEU costs in the near term, while building a supply model that reduces volatility and lowers long- term fuel exposure. Oklo's fuel strategy isn't just well designed. It's being executed today to support rapid deployment and long- term resilience. We've secured HALEU from DOE for our first commercial unit and our fast reactors are uniquely capable of using down-blended uranium and plutonium-based fuels, stockpiles that would otherwise be slated for disposal. With recent policy changes unlocking access, we can fuel dozens of early units from existing government material.

We're also executing on commercial partnerships, Centrus for long-term HALEU and Hexium for long-term innovation. Their Atlas technology could materially improve enrichment economics over time. And our fuel strategy doesn't stop at procurement. We're building towards recycling. Oklo's reactors are designed to run unrecovered fuel, supporting a close fuel cycle and long-term resilience. This isn't just a vision for the future. We're operationalizing the strategy now with a model designed to scale.

There's a growing consensus that nuclear power is fundamental to the country's energy future, but historically, costs and time delays have held it back. Nuclear power is already the most land and material-efficient energy source, but decades of legacy design, complex safety systems and custom-built construction have driven up both costs and timelines. At Oklo, one of the reasons we're in a strong position today is the disciplined approach we've taken to design and cost engineering from the outset.

Our liquid metal sodium cool design enables inherent and passive safety, reducing the number of safety grade systems we need. That simplifies our architecture, streamlines regulatory reviews and lowers both capital and operating costs. We've also minimized the

physical footprint of each powerhouse and designed around supply chain scalability, leveraging conventional components and proven industrial partners.

In the next few slides, we'll talk through how these choices translate to faster and more cost-effective deployment, starting with our supply chain and system architecture. This is where our design and supply chain strategy come together to deliver real execution benefits. Roughly 70% of our powerhouse components are sourced from nonnuclear supply chains, industrials, energy and chemicals, for example. These sectors offer mature, scalable manufacturing capabilities that we can tap into today at lower cost and with shorter lead times than traditional nuclear fabrication.

This isn't just about lowering cost. It's about reducing schedule risk as well. By designing around standardized shippable components like the reactor module, steam generators and power conversion system, we simplify installation, support parallel builds and minimize on-site construction complexity. We've also reduced the number of safety-grade systems by designing for inherent and passive safety. That helps streamline procurement and reduces the regulatory burden on our supply chain.

Our preferred supply agreement with Siemens Energy is a great example of this strategy in action, and we continue to build out that ecosystem with more partnerships to come as those deals reach commercial readiness. These decisions help us scale faster, deliver sooner and meet the needs of customers who value both certainty and speed.

We're also pleased to announce that we selected Kiewit as the lead constructor for the Aurora INL powerhouse. Kiewit is one of the most experienced engineering and construction firms in the country with deep expertise in complex energy infrastructure, including nuclear projects. Their capabilities go beyond construction. They also bring integrated procurement as well as asset and component fabrication capabilities that align well with our modular repeatable design approach.

We've entered into a master services agreement with Kiewit intended to support the full scope of design, procurement and construction for the Aurora INL project. Preconstruction activities are scheduled to begin this quarter, including site mobilization, early procurement and groundwork. We're targeting a preconstruction groundbreaking in late Q3. This partnership and these efforts help ensure we're positioned to deliver our first powerhouse on a realistic executable schedule with commercial operations targeted between late 2027 and early 2028.

In parallel, Atomic Alchemy, our radioisotope business has also begun site characterization work on its commercial isotope production facility at INL and submitted its materials license application through the NRC for its demonstration facility, continuing momentum on facility development for domestic radioisotope production. The demonstration facility will also produce revenue- generating isotopes, marking an early step toward commercial operations.

We also signed a memorandum of understanding with Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power, one of the largest and most experienced nuclear operators and builders in the world. The agreement is focused on exploring opportunities to collaborate across a range of areas, including project development, licensing, manufacturing and supply chain coordination. This partnership reflects a shared interest in deploying advanced reactors globally and in continuing to drive innovation across the nuclear value chain. It also aligns with our broader strategy of forming international partnerships that can support commercialization and accelerate deployment.

As part of our work with data center customers, we also announced a joint development agreement with Vertiv, a leader in data center infrastructure. The partnership focuses on co-developing integrated power and cooling solutions that take advantage of our ability to co-locate power generation and compute infrastructure. With Vertiv, we're building smarter nuclear power systems for compute- intensive infrastructure that could be a huge win for our customers.

Vertiv will use steam from our powerhouses to drive chillers, improving the overall energy efficiency of the data center. This helps reduce total energy costs and allows customers to streamline infrastructure with a single integrated solution. It's a strong example of how we're working directly with customers and infrastructure partners to deliver tailored solutions at the core of their operations, not just selling power, but operating integrated value where it matters most.

We continue to have active discussions with other commercial partners and suppliers to round out our deployment ecosystem, ensuring we can deliver scalable energy infrastructure with speed, reliability and efficiency.

With that, I'll hand it over to Craig to expand on our commercial momentum and walk through the financial and customer updates from the quarter.

Richard Craig Bealmear

Thanks, Jake. One of the partnerships we're very excited to highlight this quarter is our work with Liberty Energy. Liberty was an early investor in Oko while we were still a private company and former CEO, Chris Wright, served on our Board prior to his appointment as the United States Secretary of Energy. We are excited that there continue to be opportunities to collaborate with Liberty in a meaningful way. This partnership is designed to solve a very real customer challenge, how to access reliable power now with a clear path to zero carbon baseload power over time.

Together, we have the potential to offer a fully integrated solution that starts with Liberty's gas generation and load management platform that can transition to Oklo's nuclear powerhouses as they come online, providing a faster path to clean energy. This is a strong validation of Oklo's business model. It demonstrates how our powerhouses can integrate with existing infrastructure to deliver a phased approach that's flexible, financeable and customer aligned.

Customers get the uninterrupted energy today and a long-term certainty around clean baseload power. And together, we're building a joint commercial platform designed to scale. We are finalizing the commercial structure of the partnership and believe this is a scalable blueprint for high-power demand sectors that prioritize reliability and long-term energy certainty.

We were also selected by the U.S. Air Force as the intended awardee for what would be a first advanced vision deployment at a U.S. military installation. Under the terms of the Notice of Intent to Award or NOITA, Oklo was identified as the successful awardee to design, construct, own and operate a powerhouse that would deliver both electricity and heat under a long-term purchase agreement. This represents a major milestone both for Oklo and for the broader advanced nuclear sector. It reflects growing recognition of the role nuclear power can play in national security and energy resilience, particularly at distributed and remote sites where reliable power is mission critical.

Oklo is actively working with the U.S. Air Force and Defense Logistics Agency, or DLA, on next steps, and we look forward to providing further updates as the process advances. I will now provide a summary of our financials.

Oklo's second quarter operating loss was $28 million, inclusive of noncash stock-based compensation expense of $11.4 million. Oklo's loss before income taxes in the second quarter was $24.3 million, which reflects our operating loss adjusted for net interest income of $3.8 million. On a year-to-date basis, when adjusting for noncash stock-based compensation charges, changes to working capital and deferred income tax benefits, the cash used in operating activities equates to $30.7 million. We still expect on a full year basis, cash used in operating activities to be within the guided range of $65 million to $80 million that we disclosed at the start of this year.

In addition, based on our earlier discussion points in this company update, we now see an opportunity to potentially accelerate some modest CapEx investments from 2026 into 2025, which could include advancing deployment activities at INL before year-end, progressing fuel supply and fabrication activities in response to the executive orders and other activities to deploy powerhouses beyond INL.

We also completed a successful marketed first follow-on equity transaction on June 12, generating $460 million in gross proceeds, providing the company with additional cash on hand to deliver our enhanced growth agenda. And as a result of the capital raise, we ended second quarter with approximately $683 million in cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet.

To wrap up, I want to briefly highlight why we believe Oklo is one of the most compelling opportunities in the advanced nuclear industry. We're deploying proven fast reactor technology in a compact, scalable format designed to reduce cost, complexity and deployment timelines. We are vertically integrated across power generation, fuel recycling and radioisotopes, unlocking multiple high- value revenue streams.

Our business model is built around long-term power sales, delivering recurring revenue, margin visibility and customer stickiness. We are pursuing superior economics through standardized design, repeatable deployment and recycled fuel that drives long-term capital efficiency and competitive levelized cost of energy. Our 14-gigawatt pipeline spans data centers, defense, utility and industrial customers, reflecting strong and growing demand. And we've developed a streamlined licensing strategy aligned with our business model backed by regulatory expertise, a repeatable collo path and accelerating federal tailwinds. At its core, Oklo is more than a technology company. We're building an energy platform to serve the world's next era of growth. Thank you for your time. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
