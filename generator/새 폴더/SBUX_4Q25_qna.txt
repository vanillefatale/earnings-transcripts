[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI.

David Palmer
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I'll just -- I'll try to squeeze in a couple of parts to my one question. Brian, one of the things that we often find ourselves discussing with Starbucks is this Back to Starbucks often feels like back to the old Starbucks, which might have been much more of an in-cafe coffee, espresso, hot beverage. And today, Starbucks is obviously many more channels than that. It's much more cold beverage and the competitive set itself, the way younger consumers are using the brand. It's a lot that's different.

So getting back to Starbucks, people wonder if that will bring the same sort of comp energy that the old Starbucks used to have if perhaps that Back to Starbucks is addressing a fraction of the business. So maybe that's a general question that's worth discussing. But right now, some of the things you've done feel like it would be activating more of the cafe part of it. I wonder if you're seeing differences in your comps by part, by order type and maybe address that general concern about maybe activating part of the in-cafe may not be enough to drive the overall business as much.

Brian Niccol
Chairman & CEO

Yes, David, thanks for the question. Yes. No, Back to Starbucks is comprehensive. I think the way to think about it is, I'm talking about the definition of the brand, which is the soul of the brand is around customer connection and our craft as it relates to every beverage. Now that's not to say we aren't going to continue to innovate across all the different access points.

I think the place we got the most off strategy or off brand was with the cafe and the way that we handled mobile orders actually distracted us from executing really well in the drive-thru as well as the cafe and for the kind of the new emerging channel around delivery. So what I would actually say is the thing that I love about where we are with Back to Starbucks is we've now established a new Green Apron Service standard.

And that standard, okay, is going to be able to support the simple idea of what makes Starbucks a Starbucks, which is great craft, great connection. And that crafting connection can happen in mobile order. It can happen in drive-thru, and it can happen in the cafe. And I think what we saw throughout the quarter is just that. When we launched the Green Apron Service standard in the middle of August, we saw the business respond so much so that in September was the first month where we actually had comps -- positive comps driven by transactions, a point of transaction comp growth.

So Back to Starbucks is a reference around the whole brand proposition. And it gets us, I think, centered on providing a great customer service experience, which separates this brand from everybody else. The foundation is this customer connection. I think the visible transformation, you'll see in our uplifts, but I think you'll also experience it when you interact with our baristas and our coffee house leaders.

With the Green Apron Service model, we've actually freed our partners up to get back to focusing on moving towards customers, providing that connection and providing that customization in the beverage that people want, whether it's hot, cold, coffee, refreshers, and you're going to continue to see us innovate across matcha. So it's holistic. And what I love about it is I see it really playing out nicely in transactions right now.

And your next question comes from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein.

Danilo Gargiulo
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

I wanted to ask you a question on the reception of the protein platform. And specifically, what has been the feedback on the pricing point of the protein platform? And in light of the increased ticket that this might be driving, what's your updated view on the pricing that you think would be sustainable to be taking in 2026 and beyond?

Brian Niccol
Chairman & CEO

So yes, Danilo, I want to make sure I got your question right. I think I heard you asking how is the protein platform performing? And what's been the response to, I guess, the pricing architecture on protein. If I missed it, chime in after I give you the answer. So first of all, the protein platform, I am really excited about how this has come out of the gates. Awareness is still building. And one of the things that's great about this platform is you can now have protein in over 90% of the drinks you get from, okay?

So whether that's cold foam or that's through the protein milk. And the feedback from customers, whether it's been in matcha, in Iced Americano or a latte has been, you know what, this is really delicious. And that is what we need. And it also is able -- we're able to provide the protein into the customization of the way people want to have their drinks. We're not boxing them into a certain way that they have to execute it. And we also allow you to flavor it how you want.

Oddly enough, one of the top cold foams is our Pumpkin cold foam. So it's a protein pumpkin cold foam is one of our top ways that people are experiencing cold foam. I will also tell you, our value scores, and I think I mentioned this in my earlier remarks, as -- when we look at this both ways, is it worth it? And how are our value scores. They continue to increase. And the feedback we've heard on the protein specifically is it's a tremendous value with the customization, the amount of protein that you can get, so the macros associated with it.

So I'm very optimistic as the awareness builds, this platform will continue to build. And this is really just kind of the first step, I think, in continuing to drive health and wellness built on, frankly, arguably one of the greatest health and wellness drinks out there called coffee. So I'm very optimistic about where we are with this. I think the marketing team has done a great job. Our partners in store have done a great job, and the feedback from our customers, not surprisingly, has been really positive.

And your next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird.

David Tarantino
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

My question is on the Green Apron Service model. And Brian, I presume this takes some time to really get the full consumer response to the changes you've made. So I guess, can you talk about where you are in the journey after only maybe a couple of months in place? And maybe you can sort of compare your current state of the ones that were upgraded to this service model in August to the ones you did earlier in the year and how that may or may not be different as you look at sort of the duration effect that this could have on the business?

Brian Niccol
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, David. Great point. So you're right. We started Green Apron Service standard middle of August, and we really kind of rolled it out in 3 phases over the course of the last 2 or 3 weeks in August. So I would say we're really only like 8 or 9 weeks in on it. And the good news is it does appear that it continues to build week-to-week for a couple of reasons. One, our teams have to get used to operating with the additional hours and the bigger rosters. There's also an element of hiring.

And then there's also an element of giving the customer the experience so that they realize like this isn't just a one-timer. This is now the new way they're going to experience Starbucks. And probably the best evidence I have for that is the initial 650 stores that we piloted on continue to outpace the rest of our company performance. So I'm optimistic that what's going to happen is over time, as our rosters get populated, our teams get more reps with the additional investment.

They understand the 5 key moments, the coffee house walks and then our customers experience it over and over again, I think we're going to continue to see us hopefully close the gap on those first 650 stores and build just like what we saw in those 650 stores. So I think it is a little bit of time and experience, both for our partners and our customers, but it's been great to see how it's been building. And frankly, Mike and the whole operating team has done a phenomenal job with the rollout and our coffee house leaders have done a phenomenal job getting their teams excited about the new way we're going to serve customers.

And your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.

John Ivankoe
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

The question is also on Green Apron. And I'm wondering if Green Apron was done fairly defensively, in other words, to maybe fill some gaps that were in the system to really help traffic decline or if there is a more offensive element of Green Apron to actually drive traffic? And if that's the case that more hours, more staffing is leading to more transaction growth, if we have an opportunity to step up Green Apron even further?

In other words, is there a 2.0 or a 3.0 have kind of taken this even further from a staffing perspective? That's really the first part. And secondly, other than just having customers come back into the store, how do we communicate to the customer base broadly in America, some of whom may have dropped out of Starbucks to come back in and experience a better Starbucks than maybe they might have remembered it a few years ago?

Brian Niccol
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So thanks, John. So what I would tell you is, look, obviously, we had an incoming hypothesis that our stores weren't staffed correctly and that we weren't, I guess, sorting orders correctly or sequencing orders correctly between the drive-thru mobile order and the cafe. And I think as we learned, we figured out that, that hypothesis was correct.

And what required was both the Smart Queue technology to better sequence orders and then increase staffing so that our partners were able to either stay focused on the drive-thru, stay focused on their food stations, stay focused on the customer, provide a great greeting when people came in or give them a great experience at the handoff. So I think it was a combination of fixing some missteps and then putting us on the offensive because I believe we're best positioned to provide the best customer experience in the industry.

And one thing that I've heard consistently from customer feedback since we've launched this out broadly is, wow, I noticed the difference. I feel the difference. I see the difference. And it is as simple as just being greeted when you walk into our stores. And that has changed, I think, people's perceptions pretty quickly. The one thing that's great about our business, John, and you probably know this, is the frequency is so high, right?

So I've never had the opportunity to work in a business with such high frequency that if we stay consistent with the Green Apron Service standard, our customers realize it quickly. And we're also a very social brand. It gets shared pretty quickly as well. Now obviously, it's really important we continue to provide innovation so that we bring people in. And one of the things I didn't mention on protein is one thing that's great about protein is we're seeing low-frequency rewards customers show up with more frequency. So it's going to be the combination of consistently great execution.

It also -- what's nice, too, is as we perform better at peak, we actually earn even more hours, which then allows us to open an hour earlier. And then it feeds itself where, call it, whatever Phase 2 is, or Phase 3 is we're kind of earning our way into those as opposed to having to do the course correct that we had to do initially with Green Apron Service. So I love how the flywheel once it gets going on this, the experience builds for a partner and the experience builds for our customer. And then I think the transactions build in our results.

And your next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank.

Lauren Silberman
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

You talked about flat morning transactions outperforming the overall business. What's driving the relative outperformance in the morning? And as it relates to the afternoon, do you think it's more reflective of the macro or competitive dynamics? I know there's a lot of discussion around energy and whether there's some shift to energy. So just how are you thinking about Starbucks' future in that category?

Brian Niccol
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So look, I think the reason why -- well, the reason -- the data would suggest the reason why we're winning in the morning is because we're better staffed, we're providing better speed of service. while still providing that craft and that connection. And so we've just seen consistent improvement in the morning and specifically number of transactions that we are delivering per 15 minutes. And that's translating into in Q1, what was a flat transaction performance. We've also, though, seen sequential improvement in the midday and afternoon.

Not all the way to where we want it to be, but I think we have opportunity, frankly, on some of our drinks and food offerings in the afternoon that you're going to see us focused on going forward. And the good news now, too, is our staffing levels are no longer at just minimum staffing once you get to around 11:00, 12:00. We now are staffed correctly where we can better service the business in the afternoon, too. And so I think just like what we saw in the morning, you get better staffed in the morning, you get better throughput, you get better customer connection, we get better business results.

The same thing is happening in the afternoon, and that was kind of the second and third phases of the Green Apron Service model was we first rolled out the additional staffing in the morning, then we brought it into the afternoon. And I think we're seeing the sequential improvement accordingly. But we've always said we want to win the morning, and then we'll grow our way into the afternoon. And that's exactly what I think you're seeing the business do.

And your next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.

Brian Harbour
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

The investments associated with that, I guess I'm referring specifically to kind of added staffing, right? Is that in place by this point? Or I guess when you talk about leveling up Green Apron Service, could you talk about what that means from sort of an incremental investment perspective at this point? And then I guess just also on the product cost side of things as we go into '26, could you talk about -- I think you've targeted some savings here. Obviously, there's also sort of commodity inflation. Can you talk about how those things may balance each other out or not?

Brian Niccol
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So we've made kind of our initial investment into the Green Apron Service model. And now as it becomes our operating standard, we really will earn our way into the additional labor that comes with the growth. So we don't foresee additional investments, I would say, to be able to make the Green Apron Service standard come to life.

And then on your second question in regard to commodity or coffee prices, obviously, coffee prices have not retreated. They still have stayed elevated, and we're dealing with that accordingly. We're trying to find offsets where we can in the business. But hopefully, we'll start to see that recede, but it hasn't happened yet. Cathy, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.

Catherine Smith
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. Maybe just a little bit more on the investment in Green Apron Service. It started to roll out. We've been ramping it through our test program. And then it started to roll out more, obviously, earnestly in August. So you'll see that continue to annualize into the early parts of this year. We've got the full investment in the stores, but they will need to continue to annualize. So you'll see that. And then ASMs or the assistant store managers or coffee house leaders, we did say that those -- we would lag that investment a little bit.

We've started with our initial pilot. They're all hired, and we'll start to roll that. And there's a little bit of a differential there, which we talked about, too. On the product inflation, expect coffee to continue to be a headwind at least through half a year. All of our best thinking would say that we're going to start to see some relief at the backside of the year.

Your next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America.

Sara Senatore
BofA Securities, Research Division

I wanted to ask about the coffee houses that you're closing. You said they didn't demonstrate a viable path to profitability, but I wasn't sure if that's because AUVs are lower, or the costs are higher. Just trying to think through like sales transfer. And in that context, Cathy, as you think through the margin for the business over time, should I be thinking about like lower restaurant level margins, but also lower G&A to get back to kind of operating margins that look similar to where they were maybe pre-COVID. So just sort of the impact of store closures on top line and margins and then margin over time.

Catherine Smith
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. So first off, we looked at, obviously, our entire portfolio to say, can it first represent the customer experience we want going forward? That was the most important criteria. Then we also ran a financial filter, as you would expect on can it also give us a return that we would be proud of. And the combination of those got us to the closures, which we don't take lightly. And to your point, as we said in the prepared remarks, it's going to be slightly accretive to our profitability going forward because they were unprofitable.

To answer your question on why is that? It's a combination. But at the end of the day, what makes a coffee house a great coffee house is that you have to grow top line. So you've got to have a great top line. Generally, when we stood up those coffee houses, they had a good -- they were a good investment. They had a good occupancy. We expected the right labor. So it really starts with the top line. And if we can't get the top line or the revenue where it should be, that typically makes the coffee house not viable.

So I'm not saying there aren't some nuances in occupancy and labor and all that, but the biggest one is top line. So then to answer your question -- and by the way, on transfer, we do see some transfer. We've been pleased. It's been a little higher than we expected, which is great. And we kept great density wherever we could. So we are seeing some sales transfer. Going forward, though, to your question, first off, I'll put a plug to our Investor Day. We're excited to see everyone at the end of January for our Investor Day, where we will lay out a more complete financial algorithm and picture.

But to think about what do we need to be true going forward for our coffee houses, they've got to be a great return. So we've got to get an AUV. By the way, there's a pretty big spread in average unit volumes that we can make in a viable coffee house, but we have to get a good top line store, and then we'll make sure that we sign up that pro forma with a great P&L coming through it. So I say that because I wouldn't expect holistically big differences in the future. We've got to have great coffee houses, and that will drive the sales.

And your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.

Jeffrey Bernstein
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great. Cathy, I appreciate the qualitative color in your prepared remarks, and I think you actually just alluded to more of an update in late January at an Investor Day seemingly around earnings. But I'm just wondering if you can share any thoughts on fiscal '26 and longer term, whether there's any guardrails you can share today, top or bottom line as we think about the comps maybe returning modestly positive and the profitability that comes from that.

And just tying to that, I mean, I know there was often talk about cost savings in the past. I don't know if there's any kind of ballpark range as you've had more time to think about it of potential savings or maybe the greatest buckets of opportunity. I know former leadership used to talk a lot about the dollar opportunity per year or whatnot, but any early thoughts on either the top and bottom line and the cost savings surrounding that?

Catherine Smith
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

I'm going to, I'm sure, completely disappoint you in my response. First off, we'll give you 2026 and longer-term guidance at our Investor Day. We hope to see you there. But as you can imagine, Brian already shared, we're really excited that we've now gone from 6 quarters of negative comps to a positive in our seventh quarter, and we hope to build from here. And so it starts with top line.

We hope to continue to see those transactions grow, and we are optimistic there. We've got the right plan in place that Brian has outlined. So I would say that. And then over time, earnings are going to lag. So we've said that you grow top line first and then the earnings will follow. We are taking all the necessary actions now, though, to make sure that every single transaction is more profitable going forward. And that's where I would leave it for now.

And your next question comes from Andrew Charles with TD Cowen.

Andrew Charles
TD Cowen, Research Division

I'm curious how the improved value perceptions play into your 2026 pricing plans and if pricing is contemplating your belief that '26 same-store sales should build through the year. And then Cathy, just separately, the past 2 calls, you've helped set the stage on the current quarter outlook, not guidance, but more outlook for North America same-store sales. And I'm wondering if you could provide some help just on how to model that for 1Q.

Brian Niccol
Chairman & CEO

So to answer your first question on value and worth it, obviously, it's great to see our value scores moving up and is the brand worth paying for also moving up. We always are keeping an eye on our value proposition. as we think about pricing going forward, we're going to be very strategic, very targeted with and when we use it. I don't envision us just doing broadscale pricing across our menu.

So obviously, we'll continue to monitor what happens with the inflation that we have to deal with, both wage and commodities. And then we'll be smart about the growth that we get. And if we need to use that lever of pricing, obviously, we'll always keep an eye on what happens with our value rating scores as we -- if we have to move on pricing going forward. Maybe the second part of the question, I'll give to Cathy.

Catherine Smith
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. On Q1, Andrew, so we did share in the prepared remarks, we were pleased that September had turned positive, and that trend had continued through October. So that's a good way to start thinking about the quarter. And so we would expect the quarter to be led by positive transaction comps.

And as I have shared before, obviously, earnings are going to lag as we continue to annualize now that Green Apron Service investment that we've been making. We will start to see some of the offset coming through in some of the cost structure work we've done. But just it's premature to give guidance, but I would say top line growth led, and earnings will lag even versus -- obviously, not to the extent we have in the past.

Your next question comes from Christine Cho with Goldman Sachs.

Hyun Jin Cho
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

You mentioned that the college and campuses are doing well in the quarter, but there are some broad concerns about the macro pressures on the younger consumers. Are you able to comment on how the consumer spending behavior evolved with that younger consumer cohort under age 35 over the last few months and how that informs kind of your go-forward strategy? Do you view this as kind of an increasing headwind for the coffee industry in the near term?

Brian Niccol
Chairman & CEO

I would just say, as we look at every kind of generational cohort, we have seen a really nice response both in transactions and sales over this most recent quarter. And what we know we have to do is we have to deliver a great experience for these customers because I think they are going to be more choiceful with where they choose to spend their dollars. But that's why I think it's so important that when they do choose to spend their dollar with Starbucks, they walk away feeling like that was worth it, and they got a good value.

And that's what we're continuing to see happen. Definitely in the morning day part and then as throughout the balance of the day goes, we continue to strive to make sure we give them a great experience. So they say, you know what, that was a good way to spend my dollar. And that's what we saw over the quarter, and I think it was reflected in kind of the movement we saw in transaction growth.

Your next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies.

Andrew Barish
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

You mentioned some work on the last call and then reiterated the license business. Can you kind of give us a sense coming out of your meetings with them, what's going on there? And is there an opportunity maybe to sort of streamline that business to help the company-owned stores?

Brian Niccol
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Well, as you would expect, we took a hard look at both our strategy and structure. And what we've realized is there's a real opportunity for continued growth in our license business. And we also think there is a different way of working with our license partners that will set us up for success. So that's why we also had to do some of the restructuring work in how we support that business. But we do believe there's the opportunity for us to grow from a unit standpoint.

And we've got some terrific partners, some that are at small scale and others that are big scale. And we're focused on making sure that we build the right next kind of set of units and that they get operated up to the Green Apron Service standard going forward. So that was really what this whole license summit was about. We have to provide some tailoring to the execution for the certain channels. But for the most part, I think the licensor and the licensee in this case, both believe there's tremendous growth to be had in our license business.

The last question comes from Chris O'Cull with Stifel.

Christopher O'Cull
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Brian, how is Starbucks impacted by just increased competition from all the emerging beverage brands, especially maybe in the markets where you do have a significant amount of overlap? I'm just trying to understand how you guys are thinking about this new group of beverage concepts.

Brian Niccol
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Look, I think the way I have been approaching it is we got to be on our best offense. And our best offense is to make sure that we stand for the craft around our coffee and drinks and food and then the customer connection and experience that we provide. The good news is we provide all the access modes that all these new emerging concepts provide. I already have the biggest drive-thru coffee chain in America. I already have the biggest mobile order and digital coffee business in America. And I also have the biggest cafe coffee business in America.

And one thing I learned early in my career is scale matters, and we have scale in all those access points. And then we also, I believe, have a unique positioning around the craft and connection and the customer experience that we provide. So what I believe is we got to be on our best offense, and I think competition will make us better. And I've asked our organization to be focused that way where we need to be better than we were yesterday, and that's how I know we're on our best offense.

Operator

That was our last question. I will now turn the call over to Brian Niccol for closing remarks.

Brian Niccol
Chairman & CEO

All right. Well, thank you for all the questions. And look, I want to -- I appreciate everybody joining because I know this is a busy day of earnings. So thank you for joining. But as we wrap up, I want to leave you with 3 things. First, we made real progress in fiscal 2025, okay? We worked really quickly to execute the Back to Starbucks strategy. We accelerated things we knew we were working like Green Apron Service, and we've seen momentum build across our U.S. business.

And I think we have a clear line of sight on the growth that's in front of us in our U.S. business. It's also nice to see that our China business is back to growth. And you know what, we're seeing tremendous opportunities for growth around the globe. Second, I do want to point out because this is kind of David Palmer's initial question, Back to Starbucks is not a slogan. It is -- it's an enduring model for growth that, frankly, is centered on customers and it's going to be driven by our partners in our stores and it's for every access mode that people want to experience Starbucks.

And it really is getting us back to what we do best, which is exceptional craft, genuine connection and welcoming community coffee houses. And third, I think on our fourth quarter results, it gives us confidence that we really have turned the page to a new chapter in our turnaround. Our work is to be the world's best customer service company, and we want to have the best job in retail.

And I think the fourth quarter marked kind of a turn for us in our U.S. operations. So clearly not declaring any victory. We still have a lot of work in front of us, but it's clear we're moving in the right direction. And I believe we're in the process of building the best Starbucks yet. So have a great day. Thanks for joining. And obviously, we'll be talking to you in January. Take care.
