Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Jay Sole with UBS.

Jay Daniel Sole

Kevin, 2-part question. First, can you just talk a little bit about how tariffs are impacting demand from your wholesale channel partners and kind of what you've seen and what those conversations have been like? And then secondly, maybe on North America. You mentioned in the prepared remarks that brand has been inflecting maybe before the business. But can you maybe dive in a little bit more and share with us some of the green shoots you're seeing of improving brand health?

Kevin A. Plank

Yes. Thanks, Jay. First of all, I think the tariff environment isn't ideal for anyone. And I think it inadvertently hits our industry probably harder than -- everybody is affected at some level, but it really hits our industry differently. But I got to tell you, I'm not sure that what we'd be doing for tariffs would be any different than what we've already started underway. And I think I did a good job of laying that out. The 2-part approach that we have, the 2-lever strategy we have, attacking tariffs, which is number one, it's -- we don't like the environment, we don't like where the math is. We don't like how we're sitting. And I think it's important that I say that, but what we're doing about it is some of the things we've been trying to in an industry with an 18-month go-to-market cycle and for myself being back in this chair for 16 months.

We had plenty of good things happening before I got back in the chair, but I think where we've really rallied ourselves around is focusing on key items that the consumer can look at and understand it's a product that only UA could make and it's special. I think that we've been able to put that proof in the pudding when it comes to things like that StealthForm cap at a $45 price point and embedding from what has been a $25 price point in our industry that usually is out the door closer to $13 or $14 for most brands.

So changing that price point, doing the same thing with the go-to-market strategy we laid out with the No Weigh backpack in a $40 to $65 market, introducing $140. And so that first lever is that we're going to keep creating shiny new things that the consumer looks at, covets and must have. Secondly, it's really the attack that we're taking across our broader portfolio. It's beginning with the top 10s in apparel, in footwear and accessories. This has been underway, as I use the example of the Tech Tee product we have. But to be honest with you, we haven't and this -- Under Armour owns this. We hadn't updated that product in too long and we watched our average selling price continue to migrate further and further from the suggested retail price.

And so that discounting is something that we've been actively addressing and that we have a relaunch plan for that product where we're not only just going to reinvent the product, but it gives us the ability to move that price point up. We talked about pricing power before and our ability to sort of broadly add that to our overall ecosystem. We're cautious with that of where we are right now. But we believe that this process, as we've been through this reinvention is something that will give us the ability to come back to the consumer with an embedded consumer who knows the product is looking and expecting something, delighting them and giving them more and the ability to push that price point much closer to the full retail price.

So I think that lever is very solid. And I think this is very related. So thank you for the question, Jay. But when you asked about the brand inflecting before the business does. Let me give you 3 aspects of how I think about that. First of all, it's factual. And being out and seeing our base layer is trending. This campaign we have here in North America and our European team is doing a great job talking about our foundation of base layer compression, et cetera. But here in North America, we'll be launching this UA's football campaign coming up in September. And I think the product that we're marketing is on point. The product and what we're seeing is actually checking really well. I'm talking double-digit types of sell-throughs that we're seeing in our compression base layer, which has a halo effect for the overall brand of sort of bringing compression back in the top of mind, which is a category that UA owns.

There's also -- and that's hard facts. There's also our NPS score that I mentioned about things like our e-com site of going from 53% to 70%. That's best-in-class type of points that we have there. We've also seen brand metrics rising, especially with our 18- to 34-year- old demographics, growing low double digits to mid-single digits as well with brand perception. And then adding and being able to get into things like the SMS program, I think, is really helpful.

Secondly, let me just point us to retailer confidence. I've been out, I've been talking to our customers, reigniting those relationships that we have with them. I have to say, I believe there's belief from our customers that we're talking to. And that's because in some of the channel checks and you're unfortunately not seeing that come through immediately with the math. But we're seeing positive comps out there with some of our biggest and best retailers, when it comes to men's and women's apparel specifically.

In order to get that shelf space back, it's exactly where we need to be. And those are the conversations we're engaging right now. Those are just 6- and 9-month conversations typically. But they're believing and I think it's happening. Thirdly, I'll say just the subjective, you're right, Jay. I have been doing this for a long time, close to 30 years and 20 as a public company. But something is just different. As I said, our phone is ringing. You can feel it. This kid is not sort of turning their back to UA. I think they're turning into the brand.

And we're really seeing something which feels like just positive momentum. And it's a sentiment that's here in our building every day. It's a sentiment that we're, again, feeling from some of our partners. And it's not perfect out there for sure. And we have a number of things to work with and tariffs is certainly on that list. But I think if we put our head down, what we're doing right now, and we just continue to make small steps, small bites of the elephant, we're moving in the right direction. And I'll end that with just -- I can confidently tell you that today, as we sit from what I knew taking this job 16 months ago to just even a year ago, we're better than we were a year ago, we were better than we were 6 months ago, and I have great confidence, all the confidence that will be better 6 months from today.

So this projection, it feels like the trajectory is going in the right way.

Our next question comes from Sam Poser with Williams Trading.

Lance Allega

Okay. We can go to the next question, and we will get back in the queue.

Operator

All right. The next question comes from Peter McGoldrick with Stifel.

Peter Clement McGoldrick

Dave, a question for you. As we think about the SKU cleanup and pull back on promotion and pricing, can you help us think about within the 2Q revenue guide in terms of AUR and units, how should we be expecting this to develop moving forward?

David E. Bergman

Yes. I would say Q2, as we mentioned, is probably going to be our toughest quarter as we think through the year as we're making a lot of progress relative to product and hopefully, we'll see some of that coming through when we get forward towards Q4. But in Q2, I think North America is going to be a tougher decline for us. We talked about low double digit there. We're still seeing the impact of the trailing spring/summer '25 order book challenges that we spoke to before, also some traffic challenges within retail. So we're doing our best to navigate through that.

As we think about promotions and discounting, we made a lot of improvements and progress last year, and we talked about that a lot. We saw that come through the gross profit last year. We intended to make more progress on that this year. I think with the tariff environment and how that's impacting demand in the overall market, it's going to be tougher to make more progress this year, but I think we do have that increased discipline.

So we're going to make sure that we're sharper in how we do that and we don't want to go backwards for sure. So it is going to be tough as we navigate and some of that is what's assumed in our Q2, which is knowing that it's going to be a promotional environment, knowing that we don't want to play in it as much and we don't want to take steps backwards. So that does pressure revenue a little bit in our Q2 outlook, but then also the pressure that we're seeing in APAC. So those are really the puts and takes there. And then obviously, we spoke a lot about the EMEA progress and the continued momentum there, which is great to see.

Peter Clement McGoldrick

And then I'm curious on marketing investment direction. As you work to engage the 16- to 24-year-old team sports athlete, is there anything you can point to substantiate improve consideration with this younger demographic?

Kevin A. Plank

Yes, Peter, I think as I just covered with Jay's Q as well, we're seeing brand perception is up in the mid-single digits, the -- 18 to 34, the brand awareness is moving up. And so we're seeing these -- we're seeing actual measurements moving in the right direction. But I have to say this objective is probably something that weighs it even more. It's sort of the energy excitement, some of the things that we're seeing on our own e-commerce site how people are acting and engaging the products that are selling. It's products that people would typically be using other brands for. We're starting to see some of that push.

And that moves from on-field cleated products all the way to some of the more sportswear styles that we've been launching of late. We have products like the Apparition Tech and the new Sola that we just launched, which I don't think the consumer would see themselves purchasing that from us before that they're giving Under Armour permission, their sales permission to buy our brand at this time. So I think we feel pretty positive about where it's moving. And it's also the athletes that are signing with us and the partnership with Gunners and again, looking for influencers that can give -- we keep saying, give that kid permission.

Operator

And the next question is from Sam Poser with Williams Trading.

Samuel Marc Poser

Yes. Sorry about that, folks. Could you hear me now?

David E. Bergman

Yes, we can.

Samuel Marc Poser

All right. Good. So I have a handful of things. One, Kevin, you seem to be much more circumspect now than you were prior to 2019. I love some color there. Number two, can you also bridge sort of how you see this brand improvement sort of start to show up? Number three, tax rate? And then number four, can you talk anything about order book for holiday or even into spring '26 now, if you're seeing any -- what you're starting to see there versus you're only really guiding the quarter, you say it's going to take a little bit -- it's going to take longer now because of the tariffs and so on. But can you give us some color looking out to further as well.

Kevin A. Plank

Yes. I'll start, Sam, and I'll let Dave handle tax rate. But let me just give you, I think, how I'm thinking about the business, which is I've been doing this a long time, and have the ability to come back and hopefully apply all the benefit of that experience with a bit of wisdom, a lot of humility and real understanding and empathy for our consumer, for our team and what it means to be in this business. So it's a privilege and I approach it like that every day. One of the phrases we use here is model the behavior, which means it does mean showing up for a 6:30 a.m. Tae Bo class or 6 a.m. boxing class, being with our team, being here every day and just seeing and building this in a much better, bigger and better, more effective way.

I'm really proud of the team that's been assembled here. I think it's clear. We're substantially built as we look at right now. And now it's just a matter of execution. So bringing that confidence from bringing a brand partner like Eric Liedtke to the organization and many of the other additions and hires that we've made, we painstakingly have been building out the product infrastructure of the company. Now it's moving into the marketing function. Now that we have the 3 legs of the operating model, the go-to-market and the strategic business plan clearly articulated. It's a matter of execution.

So as I said, it's an 18-month process in our industry, but we'll continue to execute there. So hopefully, what you feel is a bit of much calmer and clear confidence and where the business is heading. And that's why I gave that reflection I think of where we're going.

The brand improvement it feels we have metrics, as I've stated, some of the NPS scores and other things we're seeing as it relates to brand awareness and perception with the company. But you're just seeing it from these kids. I've got to tell you is that it's different, something is different.

And that's where I get to apply the experience I've had doing this to just what you see and I think almost as importantly is what you feel in your gut. It feels like we're moving in the right direction. Let me just touch on order book, and I'll let Dave touch that as well. We're out now in the move for our fiscal year moving to the end of March. It extends things. So we're seeing a little bit of a greater impact as it relates to tariffs to the full fiscal year. And that's something that's had a bit of an effect as we're looking at some of our orders, and we're trying to work all this through to the bottom line.

We've seen some -- we've seen energy and momentum, especially with some of our sportswear products that we're bringing in. And again, the buyers and the retailers committing to things that we've won with before. Our compression base layer, anything performance in on field. We've got -- the innovation pipeline is really full right now, and there's a lot of energy from our customers with that.

And I think we've laid out, I mean, just in footwear alone, I think we've had 7 or 8 launches over a 12-week span from our SlipSpeed Echo to Sportswear, Sola, the Halo collections. How they're selling in right now, there's a bit of wait and see. And by wait and see, I mean, people are bringing them in, but they're testing. And so we're making best where we think that we're going to win. We're going to make sure that we're in an inventory positive position to be able to service that demand, but there's nothing wrong with a little bit of scarcity too. So our order book, I'm going to let Dave give a little more color there.

David E. Bergman

Yes. I mean, I think that, obviously, we're only giving real detail here on Q2, but we are excited about the reactions and the feedback we're seeing on the product. And I think that as we think forward, we get to the tail end of fall/winter '25, but then more so when we get into Spring/Summer '26, which is more Q4, we think that there'll be the most strength there, and that's what we're kind of excited about as far as how we're talking with the accounts and how they're receiving the product, what they're seeing from our kind of newly developed product team and some of the partners we're working with.

So that's kind of what we're looking at, at this point, but we're not at a point yet to give a lot more detail than that. I would say from a tax rate perspective, there is a lot going on within taxes. And I think maybe if I try and simplify it as much as possible, at a high level, we're paying taxes and we're incurring tax expense in the foreign jurisdictions where we're making income there, which -- that makes sense. But when you think about the additional tariff costs, et cetera, that we have this year, we actually won't make money in the U.S. this year, so that expected loss is there. But we can't actually take the benefit of those U.S. losses from a tax perspective because they're actually being absorbed by U.S. GILTI tax regulations, which basically requires us to use our domestic losses to offset our earnings first.

So it's a little bit of a double negative there that we're dealing with, but it all kind of is attributed to the lower profitability this year that we will grow out of as we move forward beyond this year.

Samuel Marc Poser

And just one last thing. I heard for the great fund that you guys -- your -- are you looking at different channels? Are you getting good response in different channels of distribution? And you've signed that one rapper Gunna, I heard there might be some other sort of even more prominent rapper on the horizon. Can you give us any color there?

Kevin A. Plank

Yes. We've got a lot of things in flight right now, Sam. So that's the good news. As I said, our phone is ringing. So I want to make sure as well that when we're -- I'm sort of trying to articulate like where the brand is or where we sit, I tend to come with a North American brand, but the momentum that we've seen in EMEA of sort of where Under Armour is positioned there, I think we're probably the top brand in France, and we've really built a great foundation in the U.K. as well through our European strategy, but the brand is just working. And that's what gives us probably even greater confidence that the play we're running here now is what EMEA was running 4 or 5 years ago.

And so there's great things on the horizon to come for. So we just got to head down, just keep chopping wood. But the team feels that there's great confidence here.

Operator

The next question is from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.

Brian William Nagel

So Kevin, the question I want to ask, and I guess bigger picture. But clearly, you're executing this reposition against a very fluid macro competitive backdrop. But as you and the team have been pushing this forward, dealing with some of these challenges, are there any key course corrections that you've made so far and you've started to see results from those?

Kevin A. Plank

I'd start with, Brian, is that I think that overall theme, if you ask me to sum it up, which is selling so much more, so much less at a much higher full retail price. It's our commitment to doing that in the -- with the right partners is that we're not trying to eat the whole elephant at once, we are taking this in bites. We are dealing with a dynamic and fluid environment as you said. But we'd be doing this anyway, whether it's tariffs or whatever else is happening. I think this is, frankly, the right component as we've looked at other turnarounds, what people have done in strategic transformations.

There's nothing else to do, but just slow down, focus on your core, do it better. As I said, we're in the SKU reduction, we're in materials reduction and just getting people giving -- making the toolkit smaller. So there's not as many questions as to how we're trying to build this next chapter for. So we're focused on the controllables, doing all the right things that we can, but it's not magic. And I say that not as -- I'm not asking you to wait years upon years. But I think again, month 16 of an 18-month industry go-to-market process, I think it's -- we're not that far away.

We've got work to do, but you'll start seeing it where the math will start to back up what we're doing. We can't point to it today and it's not prudent for us to do. We just say, again, have our head down and just marching forward.

Brian William Nagel

That's helpful. And then the follow-up question to that for me is you talked a lot about today about really focusing on the brand and reestablishing the brand. Is the operational structure of Under Armour correct right now? Or should we expect some additional operational changes as well?

Kevin A. Plank

No, that's what's been put in place. As I said in February, we implemented our operating model, which is category management, followed by showing you what the go-to-market and it's a very sort of commercial version of what that go-to-market looks like, utilizing that No Weigh backpack, which Elite product, number one. Clear story telling to be able to communicate that to the sales force and how they can sell that into accounts, making sure that the POP is correct in the way we sell it through. And then finally, the execution of how we're brand building around it, which I think everybody continues to ask about is that is the willingness from the consumer to be there. And that's what we're finding in some of these premium price points products that we're putting out there really seem to be working for us.

The strategy wise for us, it's just about -- again, I think execution is probably the topic of the day for us to lean on and get after. And then finally, it's the strategic business plan. Those 3 legs are in place. The foundation is there. It's a matter of us just running that through the model right now. So the GMs are really excited about. We got -- we have 4 great leaders here that are running our business and they're reporting into Eric, and it's someone with experience you've seen it before with a lot of Under Armour UA integral knowledge combined with expertise from the outside. So we're doing this ourselves, meaning it's just industry experience that's driving this for us.

Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi.

Paul Lawrence Lejuez

I wanted to understand the second quarter North America sales decline a little bit better? And how we got to that down low double digits? Was that always what the order book looked like? Did you see some cancellations? If so, you see more on the apparel side or footwear? And also curious if any of those cancellations, if you did see them, were tied to price increases that you tried to take that the retailer sort of pulled back from?

David E. Bergman

Yes, Paul, this is Dave. I'd say a couple of things there. We did speak before about the harder Spring/Summer '25 order book that we've been dealing with, and that's definitely out there. On the Factory House side and on the also Brand House side, we've seen traffic definitely trail off. And we think a lot of that has been tied to the timing of the developments and the tariff environment and some of the uncertainty that's out there in the market. And then from an e-commerce perspective, it's been pretty promotional, and we're trying not to play into that as much as we took so many good steps forward last year. So there's a lot of different pieces to that, I would say that's coming into play.

And that's something that we're continuing to kind of navigate, and we want to stay true to the strategy. We don't want to divert from that. We understand that creates some extra pressure as we step through Q2, but we're going to navigate through that.

And I think when you look at the product breakdown, there are more headwinds in footwear than in apparel, and we saw that in Q1, and we expect that will continue in Q2. Again, as we go further into the back half of the year, we see that starting to turn the other way as we get more of the new product out there, and there's a lot of new excitement around that product. So we think that, that should be more of a temporary situation as far as the lag on footwear more than apparel.

Paul Lawrence Lejuez

Got it. And then just with the elevation strategy, have you already started to take prices up on like-for-like items? And what has been your wholesale partner response to that?

David E. Bergman

So I'd say a couple of things there. We have worked through some specific and targeted price increases. More of that's going to be around some of our new product launches or relaunches. And then as we think about further down the road, and this is why we talked about more of it being a benefit in fiscal '27 is where we might be able to drive through some more holistic price increases more from a brand perspective on price levels. As we see a lot of our competitors in the space moving into that as well. We believe there will be an opportunity to do that.

Again, that's not something that we can move through as quickly as far as how it could benefit fiscal '26. So there'll be some benefits in fiscal '26 that are more targeted and specific. And I think the accounts are okay with that. As we step into fiscal '27, there will be some broader benefits from the pricing changes. And based on what we're seeing in the market from other brands, we're believing that that's going to be fairly accepted.

Next question is from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs.

Brooke Siler Roach

Kevin, as you think about the execution of the North America transformation, has anything changed in this current macro backdrop that shakes your confidence in your ability to deliver that on a medium-term basis? And then for Dave, can you just parse the comments on the DTC a little bit more in North America specifically? What actions do you have in place that can help move the needle with your customers in both e-com and brick-and-mortar post moving through some of this pressure that you're seeing in the second quarter?

Kevin A. Plank

Yes. Thanks, Brooke. I think that we're relatively confident with what we're seeing. And that means, again, some of the outlook in near term and I think that confidence is something that's reflecting through to our retailers and some of the performance that we're

seeing. So the softer traffic trend is certainly affecting across all channels for us, especially here in North America. But there's clearly -- again, as I stated earlier, there's clearly momentum that we're seeing with some of our products is particularly around our core with base layer and other things that we're pushing out there. You've got these one-off sort of glimpses of light that we're seeing in some of the new sportswear offerings, but that's a new trade for the consumer. They haven't really expected and seen us there.

So we're coming out and launching things like the new Sola collection, Halo, the new Apparition Tech, which is something in an urban environment, which is doing really well for us in some of our more targeted city stores that we have. But we're also showing them things like the collaboration we did with the car manufacturer MANSORY in Global Football. And I think you're starting to see just aspects of the brand that people haven't seen before, and it's showing up in a new way and a new place. That underpinned by our core getting stronger. It's something that we think is the halo that should help us.

And so while we're not ready to give that in terms of outlook of how that will inflect on the business immediately, we're doing well with the business. I think that's where we continue to do what we said we're going to do and just marching forward. And I want to say that with more confidence than fingers crossed. There's real context of what we're seeing in some of the NPS scores and some of the other indicators that we have around awareness and perception for the brand. So you're feeling it, and we're just starting to see that in the sell-through. So one space at a time, one foot in front of the other is how we're marching to North America.

David E. Bergman

And Brooke, I think when you think about the DTC front, the 2 big pieces are really factory house and e-com for us. Brand House is pretty small, as you know. And the bigger pressure that we're seeing is really going to be more on the e-com side, and that has to do with the level of promotions in the market right now. And we'll have to play in that to a degree, but we're really trying to hold the line and not really lose the ground and the improvements that we drove through strategically last year, and that is creating some of that extra pressure on e-com.

I think some of the additional marketing efforts that are coming through and some of the campaigns that Kevin mentioned are going to help us better in the back half of the year relative to e-com, but Q2 is still going to be pretty tough there. On Factory House, we've seen the decreased traffic and that's been really retail in total for us, Brand House and Factory House. We've been combating that with some of the assortments that we have. We've been adding some of our full price product to draw consumers in a little bit more as well just because there's not as many access points for them to get to the brand since we don't have many Brand House stores.

And so we've been able to actually combat a good bit of that through better conversion. So the Factory House impact on Q2 is less really than the e-com impact, but we're going to keep driving against that and improving as we go through the back half of the year.

Operator

And today's last question will be from Laurent Vasilescu with BNP Paribas.

Laurent Andre Vasilescu

Kevin, Dave, thanks for all the color this morning. I know, Kevin, you talked about a lowered expectation on FY '26, largely driven by tariffs and North American demand. And I know you're not prepared to guide for 2H revenues, can we assume North America's 2Q guide of down low double-digit continues into 2H? Or could we see further pressure on consumers in North America as they start to see a broad-based inflation across the marketplace?

David E. Bergman

Yes, I think that there could be a little bit of that, and we've built that into our expectations internally. But again, I think that with a lot of the relationships that Kevin and the sales teams have been driving a lot of the new product that's being shown and the excitement around that new product, we feel that we're going to be able to kind of drive against that as best we can. So I don't know that you should expect a bigger deterioration in North America in the back half. If anything, as we get further into Q4, we would expect a little bit of improvement there, mainly driven by product and some of the impacts of the improved and prioritized marketing that we're doing.

Laurent Andre Vasilescu

Very helpful. And it's good to hear about the NPS scores. I wanted to ask the second question. Gross margin guide for 2Q to down $340 million to $360 million. Can you unpack that a little bit more for the audience? Like how much is tariffs embedded in that? I think that's one of the two drivers of the pressure. And should we assume that kind of pressure rate overall on gross margins for the second half to get to the commentary around profitability being half of what it was last year?

David E. Bergman

Sure. When you think about the biggest driver is definitely the supply chain headwinds, and that's probably in the neighborhood of 300-ish basis points, 200 of that or 2/3 of that we mentioned is really the direct tariff cost impacts. And then there's some other pieces of product costing, inventory returns and things like that, that comes into play there. Then there's smaller impacts relative to channel mix. We are doing -- or expecting a little bit higher liquidation this year than last year with third parties, still staying within that 3% to 4% operating mix, but definitely maybe on the higher end where we used to be on the lower end of that. So that's a little bit of a headwind as we think about the quarter.

And then on the positive side, we do see FX benefits. And then we also see some favorable pricing changes that we would be starting to drive through. And some of that is even on the liquidation itself, even though the channel might be a little bit higher, we actually think with the product we have, we'll be able to get a little bit better pricing. Those are really smaller impacts. I would say the big one is obviously the tariff costs. And then as we think about full year, that 200 basis point comment, really is the full year comment as well. And when we look at other puts and takes outside of that, there isn't a lot going on.

When you think about regions, there could be a small headwind there just because APAC and North America declines and they're higher gross margin regions for us. But then on the flip side, with footwear growing or footwear challenged a little bit more than apparel, that mix actually helps gross margin a little bit. So there's some smaller puts and takes there. But in general, the big factor is the year-over-year 200 basis point hit on the tariff costs that we're estimating currently.

And this does conclude our question-and-answer session as well as today's conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect your lines.
