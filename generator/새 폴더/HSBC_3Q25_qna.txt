[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Aman Rakkar at Barclays.

Aman Rakkar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I wanted to ask about banking NII rather predictably, please. So just at face value, your guide does imply a decent step off in interest income in Q4. But I don't think that you really mean that. I just wanted to kind of check in around what your expectations are for net interest income in kind of Q4.

I guess I'm particularly mindful of the tailwind from average HIBOR in the quarter alongside things like the structural hedge and hopefully, balance sheet momentum. My best guess is that Q4 NII is actually up Q-on-Q. But any color you can give us there in terms of what you mean and what the drivers are, would be very helpful.

And then the second question is around deposits. And I'm interested in your take on the sustainability of the kind of current 5% underlying deposit growth that you're benefiting from at a system level. Obviously, Hong Kong year-to-date has been a key driver of that. And how sustainable do you think this level of pace is? And what confidence does it give you around things like net interest income growth next year?

Manveen Kaur
Group CFO & Executive Director

Thank you, Aman. So firstly, on banking NII. I want to say that we are not walking back the Q4 as a starter. As the maths would show, we are saying that the banking NII would be no less than $10.6 billion.

So absolutely, that's why it is $43 billion or better. And you are quite right from a balance sheet momentum, we see that continuing from the third quarter onwards, albeit there can be a few seasonality fluctuations. HIBOR is a tailwind, structural hedge is a tailwind, but we should be mindful that the U.S. dollar rate curve will be a headwind. So that's where we are on banking NII.

In terms of deposits, and as you know, we are not giving a guidance on banking NII for 2026. But our deposit franchise is very strong across all markets, all currencies, all business areas. So it's not just dependent on Hong Kong dollars. But of course, we are very pleased with our preeminent position and strength in Hong Kong, which is a key driving force for the deposit growth. So very positive on deposit growth from here on as we've had before.

Our next question today comes from Guy Stebbings at BNP Paribas.

Guy Stebbings
BNP Paribas Exane, Research Division

The first one was back on bank NII then one on insurance. So obviously, quite a big move in the banking in our guidance. Outside of HIBOR, is it really the deposit strength that's the delta in terms of the guidance here? I mean you also referenced yield curve steepening. So I'm just wondering if you would encouraged to think about anything above and beyond the structural hedge roll when you think about yield curve steepening when it comes to NII?

And then on insurance, really strong quarter, but there's quite a lot going on there, I think, so 46% growth. But you mentioned model changes, experience variance. And then if you can help quantify that, I think there might have been $150 million or so type model changes. I mean if that's the case, we're still talking about a sort of 20% clean run rate. So if you'd encourage you sort of think along those sorts of lines in the CSF now at $50 billion, it looks like a very sort of useful underpin from here?

And if I can sort of briefly flip on that. There was $1.1 billion of CSM build year-to-date from economic factors. I'm just interested how much of that is sort of purely lumpy items? Some of your peers show the normalized unwind or expected return of in-force, which can be sort of quite material and a consistent tailwind to the CSM built above and beyond the new business systems. So I'm just wondering whether we should treat that $1.1 billion boosters very much one-off or an element of that is repeatable, if you like?

Manveen Kaur
Group CFO & Executive Director

Okay. Great. Thank you, Guy. So firstly, in coming -- so with your question on banking NII. So it's -- our deposits strength, as I've called out, but our structural hedge is also important tailwind for us on banking NII and the stabilization of HIBOR, which impacted banking NII almost equivalently on the negative side in Q2 and Q3, is not expected for Q4 and has not shown that at all in Q4 so far.

The insurance growth, you're again right, it's -- the one-offs are circa $150 million, as you've called out in terms of the change in assumptions, which is a normalized annual process that we go through. So we are very pleased with a very strong CSM and balance build, which gives the underpin in terms of the growth in this business. In terms of any one-offs or lumpy items, nothing material to note, but I'll ask our IR team to follow-up with you.

You can see some of the walk on the CSM balances on Slide 21.

Our next question today comes from Katherine Lei at JPMorgan.

Katherine Lei
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I also have a follow-up on NII and then I would like to ask about Hong Kong CRE. On the NII line, I noticed that in Hong Kong, the composite deposit rate actually comes significantly in 3Q. I think this is because that this move -- migration from time deposit to demand deposits and also that banks generally lower the time deposit rates.

So into 3Q -- into the 4Q because of the rebound in -- because of the rebound in HIBOR, do we expect some of the reversal of that decline in composite deposit cost? Will that lead to some sort of risk to the banking NII? This is number one question.

And then have we seen any like further migrations or what's the trends of deposits in CASA deposits? And then the next question will be in Hong Kong CRE. We noticed that the Stage III loan ratio increased from 16% to 20%, but however, if we look at the impairment charges on Hong Kong CRE, this quarter is actually lower than that of last quarter. So I would like to have some color from management say, for example, what is the latest trend in terms of the asset quality? And what is our thought behind that while the Stage III loan ratio continued to increase, but then we slow down the pace in making provision against Hong Kong CRE risk.

Manveen Kaur
Group CFO & Executive Director

Thank you, Katherine. So in terms of HIBOR, it continues to be a tailwind from a deposit perspective, we see the trends from sort of prior quarters, continuing to Q4, so nothing much to call out there.

Specifically, yes, there has been some small rise in time deposits, but that is all factored in terms of our banking NII guidance. And I'm speaking both from what we saw at the end of the September as well as the ongoing trend. The banking NII, as I've said earlier, in addition to HIBOR, the structural hedge also continues to be a tailwind for us. And that is the reason why we have obviously upgraded our banking NII guidance.

And you know we are very conservative in HSBC. It takes a lot for us to upgrade the guidance and also to add the word or better. So take from that what you will. In terms of Hong Kong commercial real estate, I would like to take a little bit of time to share with you our reflections in the Hong Kong commercial real estate.

So firstly, in terms of residential properties, the trend has stabilized and is getting stronger. The resi property index has grown 2% year-to-date. September transaction volumes were up 79% year-on-year and the valuations as well as rentals have held well. We have also seen some supportive developments in the retail sector. Hong Kong retail sales have grown since May and are up 4% year-on-year in August. It is also underpinned by increase in year-to-date tourist arrivals of 12% year-on-year.

Now if I look at the office sector, of course, the office sector continues to be challenging and under pressure, and we expect that to continue through most of next year as well. However, there has been a slight uptick for take-up for grade A office space. So this is in the best locations with the best specs and that is an improvement, which we see quarter-on-quarter.

As you know, our portfolio is well collateralized. This quarter, of course, there was some slippage, which is expected as part of our review in as things move through from some good to satisfactory, substandard to impaired, but there were names which you are aware of, no big surprises. And hence, the ECL pickup was relatively modest.

Our next question today comes from Ben Toms at RBC.

Benjamin Toms
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

In relation to the $1.1 billion provision in relation to Madoff litigation. [indiscernible] the ongoing cases with a cumulative total contingent liability of, I think, greater than $5 billion. Can you just provide that the case that was decided last week does not set any legal precedent for the other 4 cases? Especially the 3 cases that are in the Luxembourg courts where there's a more material exposure?

And can you confirm that the litigation charge does not change your aspiration to resume the buyback at half 1 '26? And then secondly, on Slide 10, which is a really nice slide, you made 11 disposals year-to-date. It can be quite difficult sometimes to track the transactions coming out of the P&L. Is it possible to give us some idea of the annualized cumulative PBT lost as a result of these sales? Although the transactions may be RoTE positive together, it just be good to get a sense of the PBT headwind going into next year?

Manveen Kaur
Group CFO & Executive Director

Okay. Thank you, Ben. So firstly, on the Madoff litigation provision charge, you can expect that we did a thorough exercise with advice from internal, external counsel as well as colleagues in the accounting function to determine what would be our best judgment on this case. In terms of the other cases, of course, we look at read across and those gets factored in. But each case has very distinct factual considerations. So there's nothing more to add on that other than what we've already called out as disclosures in the midyear. So please don't read more into that. As you know, on this case, we won on the cash side of the element of the case, but it was the securities element that we are providing against.

In terms of our share buyback and announcements at the time of Hang Seng privatization offer. As you can imagine, this case has been pending for a while. We had looked at all kinds of downside scenarios. So when we came with our view of suspension of share buyback for the Hang Seng offer for up to 3 quarters, we still stand behind that number, that was all included.

As you know well, we will go through a rigorous process every quarter. We continue to be highly capital generative as you've seen with also the upgrades on our guidance. And once we look at that, we see where the organic growth opportunities are. Obviously, in organic, that's where the Hang Seng privatization offer comes in and then the residual after obviously, looking at the 50% dividend payout, which is a key element of our capital distribution, then we look at share buybacks. So I don't expect any headwinds in that, the up to 3 quarters still holds.

In terms of the 11 disposals, I note to your point, these are all relatively, as you can see, small disposals. What is very important is each time disposal happens and it's completed like we had the Grupo Galicia, but also as we did with the closure of the investment bank, we immediately reinvest, and the kind of areas we've invested and we've actually seen the benefits come through is we have invested in the U.K. And as you see, we have seen some loan growth in the U.K. We have invested in Wealth, both in the U.K. and Asia and the Middle East. And of course, the numbers speak for themselves.

But also we take very specific opportunities where we see either growth in volumes or new customer mandates as we saw in security, services so that we can be in a prime position to take those opportunities. So that's an ongoing piece of work. We don't stop at the end of each quarter or regularly to see what we need to reinvest as soon as we have the money available, we reinvest.

We will take our next question today from Joe Dickerson at Jefferies.

Joseph Dickerson
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I just -- it's just more of a conceptual question really in terms of the return profile of the bank. I guess why isn't this -- why isn't HSBC post-Hang Seng integration more of a high-teens bank than a mid-teens bank?

I mean, clearly, the exit rate for this year on banking NII is going to be much higher, I think, than what most analysts would have thought, particularly given that the HIBOR move, you only had about 6 weeks of that embedded in Q3. So you get a full quarter of that in Q4.

And effectively, you feed that through to next year. And yes, you can have lower rates, but ultimately, you probably have a structurally higher banking NII given the deposit mix. And then if you look at your invested assets, in Wealth, you clearly have a strong business there that continues to grow and the marginal ROE is much higher and throwing Hang Seng, you're 70, 80 bps just from the minority deduction. I guess why don't we get to a number that's in the high-teens here as opposed to mid-teens?

Manveen Kaur
Group CFO & Executive Director

Thank you, Joe. It's a really good question. As you can imagine, we in the bank obviously reflect on this very closely as well. And you'd see that we have upgraded obviously, our guidance for this year. But let me just remind you, when we came up with our target of mid-teens RoTE for the medium term, '25, '26, '27. That's a target. There's nothing that says that you will stop working once you achieve the target.

You continue to work to both achieve to target as well as to improve on the target. In terms of the target itself, we are not making any change. We will, of course, reflect on it as we go through our year-end results and go into next year and give greater details on our forward-looking guidance. But just remember, a target is something that you have to achieve or better. Target is not where you stop.

Our next question today comes from Kendra Yan at CICC.

Jiahui Yan
China International Capital Corporation Limited, Research Division

My question -- my first question is regarding to the Wealth management revenue. We've observed a very strong -- very rapid growth rate in the third quarter. Could you elaborate on the key drivers behind this performance and its sustainability? And my second question concerns is about the credit risk. In recent weeks, we've seen some risk involving the U.S. market, like the small and medium-sized banks in the U.S., they have some risk.

And also the JPMorgan, they cautious the market about the credit risk during its earnings call. Although HSBC's primary client base is not in this segment, but still I'd like to ask whether HSBC has any exposure or concern in loans to nonbank financial institutions or say, those private credit corporate sector?

Manveen Kaur
Group CFO & Executive Director

Thank you, Kendra. Two really good questions. So firstly, in terms of Wealth, we are very comfortable with our medium-term guidance of a double-digit growth in fees, though obviously, quarter-on-quarter, it can vary.

So what has been really strong this year has been investment distribution notably in Hong Kong and strong equity volumes. As I said earlier, our insurance business has continued to grow, and that momentum is helped both in terms of existing client base, but also the new clients we are onboarding in Hong Kong, in particular.

Obviously, strong equity markets have been favorable, and that becomes a lever for Wealth in terms of both the sentiment and the activity we see. But overall, not changing our guidance, but very optimistic for Wealth in future, as seen from Q3 results. And of course, be mindful there are some seasonal fluctuations, Q4 can be a little less in Q1 more, but we'll see how it progresses. So far, all on a very good trajectory.

From a credit risk perspective, and as you can appreciate, I've been a Chief Risk Officer for 5 years. So indulge me, I'll share my thoughts on that with you. Private credit as a sector, of course, is going to have stronger players and weaker players. What is very key is how you do the due diligence and what are the kind of underwriting standards you apply in this new area.

You are quite right. This is primarily U.S.-driven, 80% a U.S.-driven business, and our footprint in U.S. is relatively small. All I can tell you is that our direct exposure in the private credit space is single billion dollars. We apply the same strong credit underwriting principles there. So I'm very comfortable in that space.

What I do want to call out is, you're right, it is always the second and the third order risk that you should be very mindful of, which are not your direct exposures, but exposures you may have through weaker counterparties. We have always taken a very conservative view in terms of our exposures to smaller banks, regional banks in the U.S. and elsewhere. We've been doing that right through the COVID period, through Russia, Ukraine, through inflation, high interest rates, so on as well as exposure to smaller hedge funds.

Having said that, we closely monitor this space because you can never get too comfortable in the space, and good risk management really means looking forward to see what else can impact the overall ecosystem, which then can cause indirectly concerns to all participants.

Our next question today comes from Kian Abouhossein at JPMorgan.

Kian Abouhossein
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just to come back on the NDFI exposure because you mentioned private credit just now a single digit. NDFI would be similar. Clearly, you get your U.S. legal entity exposures, whether the branches, which is below $10 billion. So should we see that as overall group exposure roughly for total NDFI, can you confirm that?

And then secondly, on tariff scenarios, you gave an impact scenario or sensitivity scenario of low single digit on group revenues before Clearly, things have changed, but also that was on a very specific part of your business. So I'm just trying to understand how you're thinking about impact scenario going forward in the current situation and expectation of a trade deal? And secondly, also what the impact has been so far?

Manveen Kaur
Group CFO & Executive Director

So let me come through the NBF exposures. As you can appreciate, NBF is a very broad industry. My comment on our disciplined and conservative approach to weaker NBFIs holds. So from an exposure perspective, both in terms of quantum that I've called out and beyond, I am very comfortable in terms of our approach to date as well as going forward.

For the tariff exposure and the impact, as you've seen, the trade segment has continued to perform well. We have the advantage that as much as there is an impact on U.S. dollar-related corridors. There are other corridors, which are growing, which we have a strong presence in, whether it's India, U.K., Middle East, Asia, Intra Asia. So that's been quite good for us. So overall, guidance that we've given on the direct impact of tariffs has not changed.

And of course, we look at that as part of our downside risk scenarios even for the ECLs. From an overall view on the macro environment with all the trade deals being done, I'll just give one reflection that our probabilities that we give to our upside, downside in base case scenarios have now normalized, and that's resulted in some modest releases of ECLs because we think the situation is improving compared to where they were more weighted towards the downside scenarios in the previous quarters.

[Operator Instructions] We will take our next question today from Amit Goel at Mediobanca.

Amit Goel
Mediobanca - Banca di credito finanziario S.p.A., Research Division

So two questions for me. The first, just on the U.K. business. It looked like there's a bit more investment and there was also a little bit of a tick up in the impairment rate versus prior quarters. So just wanted to check what kind of investments you're making there for what kind of opportunity? And then on the impairment, what's driving that?

And then the second one is just a follow-up on the Madoff litigation. I'm just kind of curious what is really the range of outcomes? I know obviously, it says that it could be materially different to the provision. There are a lot of kind of numbers in the release. So just curious how you see that range? And I was also kind of curious why a provision wasn't taken in December '24 when you had the original ruling that went against?

Manveen Kaur
Group CFO & Executive Director

Okay. Thank you, Amit. So first on the U.K. business, we have continued to invest for Wealth, both in terms of hiring of RMs to grow our premier customer numbers and to sell more Wealth product for the customers who we already have very strong deposit base with. We are also investing as we've opened a new Wealth center in the U.K. in this space. And then business banking has been important for us for investing in, in terms of customer service, customer journeys, and that's primarily a liability-driven business.

Having said that, we are very pleased that our corporate lending book in the U.K. has shown sustainable growth in the sectors that we have lent into, so more into the new economy sectors, into infrastructure, into social housing, into innovation and so on. So that has been really positive for us.

From an impairment perspective, just to give you a context, a $300 million charge in a quarter for the U.K. is not abnormal. In prior quarters where we had to release the charge can fluctuate between $200 million to $300 million. In terms of the specifics, there were a few single name defaults, but they are all of very small amounts, so nothing notable. And no specific concentration in any sector. So I feel quite comfortable in that space.

From a made-of perspective, just to be clear, we had an appeal as of December, and the outcome of the appeal was only known to us on Friday, the 24th of October, and therefore, we gave our RNS and announcement on the provision yesterday. So the provision we have given is our best judgment of likely outcomes. It's not a midpoint. It's not a broad range as people may think, but it's just our best judgment based upon advice from both internal and external legal counsel.

Our next question comes from Kunpeng Ma at China Securities.

Unknown Analyst

It's [ Chen Li ] from China Securities. And I also have the questions about the Wealth management because of the further interest rate cut. So will the nonresident new customers in Hong Kong will slow down or keep stable? And also, how would the migration of retail deposits into wealth management products impact our wealth management revenue?

Manveen Kaur
Group CFO & Executive Director

Thank you. So on Wealth management, the growth of wealth management that we've seen comes both from new customers, but primarily from our existing customer base in Hong Kong. We do not believe that at a normalized HIBOR rate, which we've had seen for quite a long period of time despite the fluctuations we've had earlier this year that, that should have an impact on both the appetite of our customers for Wealth management products, their desire to diversify and our matched product offering, which is in a prime position to meet their needs.

So I don't think there is anything more to call. Obviously, a positive stock market is good optimism factor and encourages customers to invest even more. But the baseline growth that we are seeing quarter-on-quarter is very much expected to continue.

Operator

Our next question today comes from Alastair Warr at Autonomous.

Alastair Warr

I just wanted to quickly return to the Hong Kong CRE question. You saw as you touched on yourself some downward migration. You said before, you've been focused particularly on the higher LTV problem loans.

And those have gone up quite a bit again, third quarter versus the half year. So could you just give us a little bit more about what's going on in collateral there in the background, why the ECL would be able to come down by quite a bit in terms of, say, individual clients posting more collateral, what the values have been doing in the quarter?

Manveen Kaur
Group CFO & Executive Director

So thank you for the question, Alastair. So in terms of the Hong Kong CRE, you're right, if you look at the LTV, 70% plus the number, which has grown. But in the same note, we've taken more provisions. So net of the provisions quarter-on-quarter, that number has pretty much stayed steady around the $900 million.

Now in terms of valuations, of course, we look at valuations across the board. And particularly for these, we look at them on a quarterly basis as well as if there are any transactions or events that cause us to pause and look at the valuations, again, we are looking at that. The real distinction between perhaps what you saw in the middle of the year and now is that there is no individual surprise name or situation.

And overall, in Hong Kong CRE, retail has got better, residential, as we know, has stabilized. And on the office space, which is challenging, we are not so far seeing improvements, which are coming from the momentum even slight as it may be in terms of A-type properties going into the rest of the office space. So hence, I think that challenge will continue.

Operator

Our last question today will be from Andrew Coombs at Citi.

Andrew Coombs
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

A couple of questions, please. Firstly, just to follow up on divestments. You've now announced Sri Lanka, you've talked about Egypt retail being up for review. I see there's no mention of Australia or Indonesia in the slides this time, whereas there was in Q2. Can you just provide us with an update there? Particularly Australia because that is a potentially more sizable divestment.

And then the second question, just on the new disclosure on Slide 7 where you provided the resident versus nonresident split of the additional customer in Hong Kong. Perhaps you could just give us an idea of what the split is of the stock as well as the flow. How that changes with Hang Seng Bank if you were to combine the two, not just look at the Red brand and how the revenue margins compare between resident versus nonresident?

Manveen Kaur
Group CFO & Executive Director

Thank you, Andrew. So firstly, your questions on the divestments that we had called out in terms of strategic reviews. There is no further news. They are continuing through that strategic review process. So that's why we haven't called out anything specific here.

It's work in progress, no turning back as such. So the slide that we have said on the resident and nonresident, the reason for that slide is really twofold. Firstly, to explain to you that why this growth and the reasoning of how it's grown up since the borders opened up in '23 and see that trajectory, and that shows how the trajectory is continuing. However, it does show that fundamentally, the customers who are coming in to begin with are coming with small balances, and it's a deposit-led growth story.

There is also an uptake on insurance, which is a preferred product. So we called that out. The other Wealth products, it takes time to convert. Overall, if you look at the premier customer base between the start and the end, it stays pretty much stable, 15% to 16%. So that's how I would look at it. And new customers coming in, in terms of a trajectory has continued pretty consistently at least through this year at 100,000 plus every quarter. It's a little higher than what it was in '24, which was a little hard to begin with from where it was in '23. So you can see that as a continuum.

In terms of Hang Seng, they don't do a third quarter filing. So I don't want to say anything about that. There's no news to share. They are a listed company in their own right. But obviously, as we have talked about the opportunities for revenue growth and operating leverage as part of our offer that does call out that from a revenue perspective, particularly on Wealth products, we will have greater opportunities to leverage the Wealth products in the Red brand, for the Green brand customers, both existing and new, which continue.
