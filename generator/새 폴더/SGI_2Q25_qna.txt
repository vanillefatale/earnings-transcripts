Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs.

Susan Marie Maklari

My question is on the demand side. In your prepared remarks, you said that the quarter started soft and improved as we moved through the last couple of months, and you're feeling more encouraged going into the third quarter. Can you talk about what has changed in the last couple of months that you think is making the consumer feel a bit better? And what you're watching for from here out to determine how we -- how the industry and your sales come together? And perhaps, is there any upside to your expectations that the industry will be down mid-single digits this year?

Scott L. Thompson

Thank you, Susan. First of all, I think you can go to consumer confidence. If you remember, in the first quarter conference call, we pointed and talked quite a bit about the weakness in consumer confidence and the correlation to consumer confidence in our business as we think about it. And consumer confidence has stabilized, and we'll call it upticked some. So I think the first thing I'd point out is the lack of new surprises or something unusual coming out of Washington. So consumers are kind of stabilized and slightly better.

I think the next thing I would probably lean on, and I can't be precise because I don't have -- I don't know exactly the mix of it, would be the Sealy Posturepedic launch. I mean we've called it out for quite a while in the size of this launch, the largest launch in bedding history. It was a huge undertaking, both by the company, by retailers, by some great suppliers. It took a little bit longer to get through the system as retailers had to sell off their floor models and their back stock, as we don't sweep the floor. So that's a difficult lift for the retailers, and they did a great job.

And then we launched for the first time, national advertising on Sealy during the quarter. And you could see it in the Sealy numbers. It started a little slower in the quarter than we expected as it took a little while again to get the product placed. But boy, where it was placed, strong velocity in the SKUs and then that momentum continued to run into the third quarter, as we talked about in our prepared remarks. So I guess, in short, just general, no surprises, nothing weird from a consumer confidence standpoint, a little bit of a recovery, then good product innovation and advertising.

Just to add on to that is at the midpoint, what we're assuming is that, call it, low or mid-single digit from an industry decline standpoint. When you translate that into what it means for Tempur Sealy, the way I think about it is EPS, nice growth in the back half, call it, mid- to high single digits. And what I would expect is more of that growth from an EPS coming in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. And that's nothing more than the historic seasonality of Mattress Firm, a little bit more advertising in the third versus the fourth. So what does all that mean? Think about EPS in the third quarter in the mid-80s with the balance coming in the fourth quarter to get to that midpoint of $2.55.

And your next question comes from the line of Bobby Griffin from Raymond James.

Robert Kenneth Griffin

I guess the first question is on the revenue synergies that you guys talked about. If I kind of do the quick math, I think it implies roughly about a 15% contribution margin on the incremental revenue. So can you unpack that a little bit? And a, is that accurate? And then b, what is the assumptions that you guys think the incremental revenue comes through? Is it Tempur-Pedic, Stearns & Foster, Sealy or OEM business? Just to help us tune up our models a little.

Bhaskar Rao

Sure. When I think about the flow-through, let's start from the revenue side initially. So our previous expectation for balance of share was high 40s, call that 49%. I was sitting here today, we're in and around low 50s, call that a few percentage points increase. When

you do the math and reverse engineer it, you're going to get a flow-through of somewhere between 30% to 35%. So getting to that incremental $20 million of EBITDA. So just triangulating on what that is versus our midpoint where we were before in EBITDA versus where we are, it's the faster than accepted or expected realization from those revenue synergies is resulting in our revenue beat. As it relates to where it's going to come from...

Scott L. Thompson

I mean the flow-through is a little bit challenged because if you're on the OEM side. Obviously, as you know, Bobby, it's not very strong on the Tempur Sealy business unit. But a lot of that flow-through is going to come through Tempur, which is strong at the retailer side of the equation and at the manufacturing side. So it's pretty much a blend.

Operator

And your next question comes from the line of Dan Silverstein from UBS.

Daniel Arnold Silverstein

Maybe just to dovetail on Bobby's question. So if you're adding the sales synergies and now it sounds like $20 million of potential marketing synergies, why wouldn't this support a higher long-term earnings target relative to the $4.85 goal? Just wondering if anything has changed in terms of other drivers of the business or cadence of how you get there?

Scott L. Thompson

Sure. Great question. I mean let's step back. I mean the 3-year perspective we put in the market is a perspective that has an embedded estimation of what the industry could grow at based on historical terms. We don't really think of it as guidance. It's more of a computation of the business model works, but it's reasonable with those assumptions.

And our thinking is we probably would update that annually with all of the changes that go on in the world. There's no question that from a company-specific standpoint and the performance of the combination of the 2 companies is performing ahead of our expectations from a revenue synergy standpoint and those economics, you see a little bit in the second quarter, you'll see a lot more of it in the third quarter. And it's very logical to assume that, that would be positive to the perspective that we put out on the long-term performance of the company.

At the same time, the underlying industry when that perspective was put out, we were expecting the industry to probably turn around a little faster than it has the last couple of quarters. And so that would probably be a little bit of a headwind. And there's other changes here and there. I don't -- we haven't tried to take the changes each quarter and then apply it to the perspective that we put out there. We're going to update that at the end of the year, and there will be puts and takes on that.

But there's no question that the revenue synergies would be net additive to the perspective when we put it out. But again, there's also -- there's some other stuff going the other way. But we'll update that at the end of the year.

[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Brad Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Bradley Bingham Thomas

Congrats on the good start here with Mattress Firm. My question was around your relationship with non-Mattress Firm retailers. And Scott, I was hoping you could just talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in terms of sales trends within your different brands, how slot count is holding up? And just more broadly, that relationship with the non-Mattress Firm retailers as you all now own this #1 retailer in the segment?

Scott L. Thompson

Sure. Our net slot in the second quarter with third-party retailers is net up from the same period last year. If I look at the top 5 retailers and I look at our business with the top 5 retailers, it has grown and has increased quicker or yes, I guess, quicker is a good word than the market share. So I would say that those 2 stats would be the first things that I would lean into. I would say that the Sealy

product has done very, very well with third-party retailers and it continues to be business as normal. And normal is with great product, advertising, sales support to logistics, where we help third-party retailers drive their business, which is our business plan, we're getting great reception.

[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Peter Keith from Piper Sandler.

Peter Jacob Keith

Thinking about the sales mix between Tempur and Sealy, I'm wondering if you are experiencing or could start to experience some mix pressure on your gross margin, if the strength in Sealy would push Sealy sales growth ahead of Tempur-Pedic growth. And on a related note, one thing we are hearing in the retail channel is that the high end of the Sealy line is so good that it's actually cannibalizing the low end of the Tempur line. So maybe you could comment on that potential as well.

Scott L. Thompson

Sure. I mean, first of all, the Tempur brand was the strongest brand in the second quarter, just to kind of put a base. On a go-forward basis, which is what your question is, I think it is possible that the Sealy brand will grow faster than the Tempur brand for a couple of quarters. And it would be a slight headwind to the gross margin.

Bhaskar Rao

That in and of itself. That is correct.

Scott L. Thompson

Incrementally EBITDA, but the margin percentage, you might get a little bit of pressure.

Bhaskar Rao

One just has to be mindful when you're thinking about gross profit is that foreclosed distribution. So when you put all that together, the current expectation is that mix will be favorable. However, in and of itself, if Sealy versus Tempur, there would be a little bit of a headwind.

Scott L. Thompson

Yes. In fact, I probably would expect probably Sealy will grow faster than Tempur for a couple of quarters. Yes. I mean it's doing very well. On the high end of Sealy, as you probably know, we work very hard to position the Sealy Posturepedic brand. We'll call it up a notch from a positioning standpoint, which is good for us, good for the retailers, good for the customer.

I don't think it's cannibalizing anything from Tempur. Those are really unique positions and unique fields in those products. I do think that there is some cannibalization going on between Stearns & Foster and Sealy Posturepedic. And that's by design and it was planned, but there is some -- because both those are spring beds. And until we get the new Sealy -- Stearns line out, there's a little more overlap there than it's probably needed long term. But when the new Stearns line comes up, we'll probably move it up a little bit and fix that problem. But net-net, that was a planned cannibalization. And again, it's what I would consider to be minor and Tempur is doing well.

And your last question comes from the line of Rafe Jadrosich from Bank of America.

Unidentified Analyst

You have [ Victoria Fisgrev ] on for Rafe Jadrosich. My question is more on the tariff side on your investor presentation. What are some of the components of your exposure, whether that's more steel versus fabric? And what are some of the mitigating actions you're taking?

Bhaskar Rao

Sure. Good question. What I would say is, largely speaking, versus where we were in the first quarter, our tariff thinking really hasn't changed. There has been some moving pieces as it relates to the government, but how it impacts the SGI group, not a big driver. When I double tap into that and think about where it's coming from, again, consistent with the first quarter, yes, steel, the steel aluminum, how that impacts the Tempur Sealy or the SGI family is associated with adjustables primarily.

So when I think about the big items, it's really the steel, specifically the adjustables, a little bit on the textiles because there's a big drop-off when you think about the Pareto of where this exposure is coming from. However, the next item below that would be associated with the textile, and that's principally a USMCA issue between whatever NAFTA has called out.

Scott L. Thompson

I think just in summary, maybe, not just Tempur Sealy, SGI, Mattress Firm, the whole industry has been able to, one, kind of move some supplier stuff around, find some cost savings and then pass on just a small amount of price increase to pretty well mitigate the known tariff exposure we're working with today.

And we now have additional questions in the queue. Your next question comes from the line of Brad Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Bradley Bingham Thomas

Scott, I wanted to ask about product innovation and particularly with the news of the partnership and investments in full power and again, now being even more vertically integrated in the U.S. How should we think about the pace of innovation and how you all may innovate differently, if at all, from a product standpoint?

Scott L. Thompson

Thanks for the question. You're right. One of the advantages of combining with Mattress Firm is to align on technology for future innovation. Mattress Firm was going down a different path from a technology standpoint and had a different technology strategy. And then, of course, we have our technology strategy leveraging full power. And quite frankly, the thought of one day in the future going to Mattress Firm or any other retailer and the RSA explaining to you, here's one app if you buy this bed, here's another app if you buy that bed and trying to explain multiple technologies. To me, it sounded like a disaster on the floor.

And so the combination allows us to streamline under one technology platform. That will accelerate innovation and also it derisk the innovation because we have known distribution that -- so when we develop something, we know we have a home for it, and it's a home that's large enough to drive that technology to make the economics work. So I do think the combination of Mattress Firm was an unlock on what I'll call future innovation that will be more complex and change your sleeping experience.

Operator

And your next question comes from the line of Bobby Griffin from Raymond James.

Robert Kenneth Griffin

Bhaskar, I just wanted one quick model follow-up on one of your comments. The down 2% wholesale like-for-like that you gave us ex the distribution change for an OEM customer, does that also neutralize for all the moving parts with floor samples? I know the timing this year in 2Q was different than the timing last year when you guys shipped different products, especially given the size of the Sealy launch. So just trying to get a clean way that you and the team are looking at it.

Bhaskar Rao

No, it does not. When you think about the floor model headwind in the second quarter, think about on the EBITDA line, something around $8-or-so million. And on top line, think about it at $15 million.

Operator

Thank you. And that ends our question-and-answer session. I will now hand the call back to Mr. Scott Thompson for any closing remarks.
