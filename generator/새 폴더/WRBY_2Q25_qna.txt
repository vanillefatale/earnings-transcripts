[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brooke Roach of Goldman Sachs.

Brooke Siler Roach

Neil, Dave, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the latest views of the health of the eye care consumer and your confidence in driving continued sequential growth in this mid- to high teens range on a go-forward basis. And then for Steve, can you just help us a little bit with the magnitude of potential SG&A leverage on a go-forward basis? Understood that there's some really nice gains over the course of the next couple of quarters associated with some of these tariff savings actions. But what's the opportunity for that over the next couple of years?

David Abraham Gilboa

Thanks, Brooke. We continue to feel fortunate that we operate in a category that is a health need. So while we sell fashion accessory, it's also a health product, as you know. And we do see stability in our customer base, and we see that consistency, whether it's in repeat purchasing or in sort of our product mix. We did see some choppiness earlier in the quarter. As you've heard from many companies, April was challenging. We have sort of recovered and have strong trends now that give us confidence for the remainder of the year. But as we've demonstrated over the last few years that irrespective of the macro environment, we're going to continue to grow at a rapid clip and in a consistent and predictable way by delivering exceptional value and incredible customer experiences.

And one inherent advantage whenever there's a crisis, as a lot of companies face in April, we tend to adapt and move faster than many of our competitors, and that puts us in a competitive -- a better position. So as an example, we were able to quickly roll out select and strategic price increases that have sort of benefited our growth. Now those have enabled us to still maintain incredible value for our customers, as we saw competitors raise prices higher than we have as they have for the past 15 years. So we think we're actually even offering more value than we did when we first launched in 2010, which again gives us confidence, again, irrespective of how the market is behaving.

And now I'll pass it over to Steve.

Steve Miller

And thanks for your question on leverage from adjusted SG&A, non-marketing adjusted SG&A in particular. So I'll first just by providing a reminder of what is in our adjusted SG&A stack. So for Q2, roughly $105 million in expense $26 million was marketing. The remainder of that is really split into a few categories. It's salaries for our retail store teams, our customer experience teams and then a range of corporate expenses.

As it relates to retail, we continue to make strides to better and more efficiently staff to match staffing in stores with demand that we're seeing from customers. For our customer experience team, we talked specifically this quarter, for example, about a restructuring change that we've made to that team due to the fact that we're able to -- enabling ourselves to better leverage AI technology and increase our level of outsourcing. That's $1.3 million charge that we've disclosed, and our ability to more efficiently staff customer experience has certainly been a source of leverage.

The next category is really corporate expenses. So headquarter salaries, what we pay to our vendors, what we pay to our consultants, and we take a very disciplined approach to how we allocate capital to all of those areas. Year-to-date, we've seen roughly 300 basis points of leverage from non-marketing SG&A. And on a historical basis, just to set the stage, in 2023, 240 bps of improvement. Last year, 170 bps of improvement. This year, if the trend continues, 300 basis points of improvement. So across those categories, we feel very, very confident that we'll continue to drive adjusted SG&A leverage, which will certainly be a part of our adjusted EBITDA margin story this year and for years to come.

Our next question today comes from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.

Dana Lauren Telsey

Steve, best of luck on your next chapter. As you think about the Google announcement that was made earlier, where are you on the progress there? How do you think about that development, given the importance of those glasses to the overall ecosystem going forward? Tell us a little bit about that. And then with the Target shop-in-shops, I think what is it 3 days or whatever that you're open. I know the first 5 this year, how are you thinking about next year? And just lastly, the price increases that you took selectively, response to that, what are you seeing from the end consumer?

Steve Miller

Great. Thanks, Dana. We're really excited to partner with Google for a number of reasons. But first and foremost, because they're the global leader in AI and their deep mind team and broader organization continue to push the boundaries of what the latest Gemini models can do. And we anticipate that smart glasses adoption will dramatically accelerate when consumers are able to use their glasses, not only for photos and audio, but when they become the primary interface with which they engage with AI. And we believe that Google has very unique capabilities in terms of how advanced their AI is, not to mention the scaled assets they have from the Android operating system to Gmail, Maps, Search, YouTube, and so much more that will give wearers incredible value when paired with Gemini.

And since our founding in 2010, we've been a technology innovator in the optical industry and have designed products that blend fashion, health, and personal identity. And by combining that foundation with Google's cutting-edge AI and software, we believe we can unlock entirely new levels of utility while making sure that our glasses wearers continue to look good and feel their best. And so it's we believe this is a massive new opportunity, and we've seen computing evolve from desktops to laptops to phones. And we're incredibly excited that as we enter the AI era, glasses are poised to be the next major computing platform.

So it's hard to overstate the size of this potential market opportunity, and we're pleased by the progress that we're making and look forward to sharing more about our product road map and timeline in future calls.

David Abraham Gilboa

And Dana, just to share a little bit about our Target shop-in-shops. It's been great partnering with the Target team. They have a great appreciation for brands and for customer experiences, and we've been able to literally design a Warby Parker and club it within Target. So you walk into the threshold of the Warby at Target, and it feels like any other Warby Parker store. It's staffed by Warby Parker team members, leveraging Warby Parker technology.

And so far, we're on track, and we've gotten a great response that we're excited about. We've been able to leverage and promote sort of internally from Warby to staff the Warby Parker at Target stores. And this has been a strength of ours across the organization. It's just our great talent pipeline that just having great retention enables us to do, and it's particularly important in our category, as one needs to develop expertise around our product assortment, around prescriptions, around opticianary. So we're able to leverage that for our Target shop-in-shop. So the early reception has been very positive. The remaining stores will open this month in August. So yes, we're excited.

With respect to the selective price increases that we took, overall, well received. We've seen minimal impact to conversion and mix. And in some cases, we actually saw a stronger uptake on higher-value lens upgrades. So as we look across our assortment, again, we're providing greater value in terms of price to quality than we think we have within a competitive landscape for the entire 15 years that we've been in business, as we've seen competitors take price. And this is one of the first times that we've actually increased prices over the last 15 years, whereas a lot of our competitors are increasing prices of frames and lenses on an annual basis. So we continue to hear from our customers just how much value that they get from what our premium products sold at a very accessible price.

The next question today comes from the line of Mark Altschwager from Baird.

Mark R. Altschwager

Steve, best wishes in your next chapter. So first, I was hoping you could help us understand the drivers to the revenue growth acceleration you're seeing into July. Is that happening across channels? And then how should we think about the contribution from customer growth versus revenue per customer in Q3, Q4? I guess where are you seeing the biggest change in trend there?

Steve Miller

Sure. And thank you for the good wishes, Mark. I'm excited to be able to talk more openly about my next opportunity at some point. It's been wonderful working with you and everyone on the call. As it relates to your question around growth that we're seeing across channel, so really starting in May through to July, as Neil called out, we've seen an acceleration in growth across retail and across e- commerce. So we've been pleased to see that it's been an omnichannel lift across the business, in some ways, supported by the pricing changes that we enacted at the end of April that are only reflected in May and June for the quarter, but the positive momentum has really carried through to July.

As it relates to how we think about growth from active customers versus average revenue per customer, as Dave called out, we're pleased that this is our eighth consecutive quarter reporting LTM active customer growth up 9%. We continue to see a positive trajectory as it relates to that number, with healthy growth in average revenue per customer. This quarter, that number came in at $316, up 4.6%. On our last call, we talked about there might be a slight rebalancing in how we see the interaction of growth driven by those 2 numbers, where we might see moderately higher growth driven by average revenue per customer, driven by the small set of price increases we implemented and moderately lower growth from active customers, but we would still contextualize the path that we're seeing for both active customers and average revenue per customers as positive and strong.

Mark R. Altschwager

And then separately, can you talk a bit more about the Warby Advisor you called out in the release this morning?

What are the key capabilities? How are consumers interacting with it? And just any thoughts on the impact that could have on conversion and revenue per customer as that rolls out?

Steve Miller

Yes. This is a new feature that we introduced on e-comm that uses AI-driven personalized recommendations that recommends frames based on the users' face shape and features, along with their preferences around different styles and colors, and materials. And the intent here was really to bring the best parts of our retail shopping experience online, where if you walk into one of our stores, one of our expert style advisers can look at that customer, their face shape and contours, ask them a few questions around what they're looking for, and then help provide personalized recommendations. And now we're able to do that online using AI and all the best elements of our virtual try-on experience.

And so we introduced that feature in Q2, and we're seeing very strong adoption in terms of engagement and sales. And that gives us confidence to move beyond what has been a big driver of our e-comm business historically, our home try-on program. And the new features that we've introduced are driving strong year-over-year growth in direct e-comm glasses purchases that don't involve a home try-on. And now we'll have one less message on our site in our marketing materials, and we can more effectively reallocate those resources to driving customers to the newer parts of our business that are driving higher incremental returns, namely to our 300-plus stores and our AI-driven digital features on our site.

The next question today comes from the line of Oliver Chen from TD Cowen.

Oliver Chen

Steve, congrats, and it's been wonderful to partner with you. Steve, Dave, and Neil, the Google partnership is really exciting. Would love thoughts on as you see competitive differentiation versus the current offerings in the market, and also your take on the evolution of distribution. I'm sure that you'll do this in a very customer-centric way. Second question is on all the progress you're making with insurance and reducing friction, as well as growing awareness. What's ahead there in terms of how you're thinking about the multiyear opportunity and different things that can happen to further enhance that, especially as your awareness grows. And finally, Steve, as we

think about contacts and progressives, they're both nice opportunities with different margin complexions. Could you help highlight the longer-term impact there and also your vision for mix, given that they both have nice TAMs as well?

David Abraham Gilboa

Thanks, Oliver. Yes, we couldn't be more excited to be partnering with Google as we think about creating the future. These AI glasses are being developed for all-day, every-day wear. And what's so powerful about this form factor is that it can see what you see, and you can engage with AI in a different way that's generally possible right now. And by partnering with somebody with Google, who literally wrote the research on artificial intelligence, which other folks have built their tools, right, we're sort of going to the originator of all of this amazing innovation. And if you think about all of the incredible products that the Google ecosystem has that can be leveraged to make all of our lives better and more productive and enable us to leverage our curiosity in ways that we haven't been able to before, frankly, it's something that gets us just incredibly excited and motivated.

So the key differentiator, we think, is that these are being designed for all-day use and that AI is something that will be incredibly useful. The term that we tend to use is helpfulness. And we can't wait until we're in a position to show you the product and for you to try it.

In terms of distribution, this is a device and a category that needs to be eyewear first. And the same principles that go into selling and shopping for traditional eyeglasses are going to need to be applied for this new wearable device, in that it's unlike other devices or consumer electronics in that it sits on your face. And as we know, we all have different facial features, from different pupillary distances to nose bridges. And we think that we're uniquely positioned to provide an exceptional shopping experience. Our staff is trained in helping everyone find the absolute best pair of glasses for them that best represents their identity. And we think that we're also best positioned to enable people to test and try and demo this new product that will be different from what people have experienced in the past.

So our distribution of now 300 stores, our ability to provide best-in-class primary eye care through eye exams and retinal imaging, our cohort of some of the best opticians and optometrists in the country, the locations of our stores in some of the best streets and malls and lifestyle centers across the country really put us in, we think, an incredible position to help develop and grow this nascent market.

As it relates to insurance, we're seeing significant year-over-year growth in our in-network insurance business and continue to be pleased by the early signs from our Versant MetLife integration. We're seeing the cohorts of our newly integrated Versant members ramp in line or ahead of prior insurance cohorts. And we really view this as a multiyear tailwind. And if you look at our longest- standing insurance relationships, we continue to see increasing utilization and increasing revenue per member per year, even several years after our initial integrations, and we expect the same with Versant. And we continue to find that our insurance customers spend more in each transaction and repeat more frequently. And so we're eager to make it even easier for people to use their in-network and out-of-network benefits with us so that their dollars go further.

And in that vein, we do continue to pilot relationships with other carriers and look forward to unlocking additional relationships over time.

Steve Miller

And Oliver, regarding your questions about contacts and progressives as long-term tailwinds supporting growth for the business, I'll talk about each one separately. So contacts is a $12 billion market. If you annualize our most recent results, our contact business is order of magnitude, $95 million to $100 million. So just a drop in the bucket is what we have in terms of the broader market share. The typical contact retailer at scale sells roughly 20% of their business mix in the form of contacts. Contacts are just an 11% portion of our mix. And so we see a dramatic opportunity just to continue to take share of this large market and see that proportion of our business mix increase over time.

I will also say one of the nice things about the contact lens purchase, it's the most subscription-like purchase of all of the products that we sell. We have talked about contact lenses having a lower gross margin profile from a percentage perspective. But given the subscription-like nature and the regularity of the purchase, the gross margin dollar profile is certainly very appealing and accretive to our gross margin dollars.

Moving to Progressives. We'll also lay out the backdrop from a market size perspective. So progressives, trifocals, and bifocals make up roughly 40% of all prescription units sold. Just 23% of our business today is made up of progressives. As a reminder, progressives are our highest priced and highest margin glasses product, and that's certainly been a continued driver of increase in average revenue

per customer and an increased driver of our gross margin. As a reminder, we'll also say that progressives are largely purchased at retail, given the progressive customer is slightly older, and there's a more complex measurement that needs to be taken called Seg height, which can be taken with more accuracy in-store. And so sales of progressives in-store are higher and will be supported by our continued rollout of retail stores. So as we open up more stores, that business line will continue to grow. And we certainly see both contacts and progressives as long-term tailwinds supporting growth over the coming years.

The next question today comes from Paul Lejuez from Citi.

Brandon Babcock Cheatham

This is Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. Steve, I want to add my congratulations. It's been great working with you, and best of luck on the future opportunity. Can you talk a little bit about sunsetting your home try-on program? How much of that is getting reallocated in marketing or elsewhere versus providing potential margin upside in the future? And then just about how much of your direct business is initiated through the home try-on program?

David Abraham Gilboa

Thanks, Brandon. The day we launched Warby Parker in 2010, GQ published an article calling us the Netflix of eyewear, comparing our home try-on program to the DVDs that Netflix mailed at the time. And just like Netflix has evolved their business model, we've evolved ours over the last 15 years to the point that home try-on is no longer necessary as part of our core offering. And while we're grateful for how much impact our home try-on program has had, we're excited to be entering a new era for the business that's centered around our 300-plus stores and AI-driven personalized digital tools.

And really the home try-on program was designed to enable people to try on glasses before we had stores and before technology existed to enable a true-to-scale virtual try-on. And now we're frankly able to solve that fitting problem better using our stores and digital capabilities. And we have included our home trialing costs historically as part of our marketing line item. And as we wind down this program, we're excited to be able to reallocate those resources and that capital to awareness-driving activities and customer acquisition that we believe will drive higher returns and that we have evidence of higher ROI.

Brandon Babcock Cheatham

And if you're able to share like when might you be able to go to market with your Google AI glasses? Or when do you anticipate having a prototype ready that you could share with us?

David Abraham Gilboa

So we're very excited by the progress that we're making. We don't have a timeline to share yet, but we look forward to sharing a lot more in future calls.
