A question for you on the home team business. I know that installations are still up meaningful and I think Harry you called that about $400,000 of incremental expense just from installing the tubes. How should we think about the timing to get over the margin hump here maybe where installations are going to be outweighed by starting to see customer signups and new service?

Harry J. Cynkus

The big question that I think in a lot of peoples’ mind is what kind of housing starts will we see next year, what kind of growth will the home team see? They’re in 17 out of the 20 fastest growing markets so obviously they’ll do better than what the average is plus or minus. I think their outlook right now and based on what they know with builders they are still planning an increase, certainly at a more modest pace than what they had this year. Certainly, the incremental change and impact on each quarter for the loss incurred on the installs should be less.

At the same time, as Gary pointed out, we’ve done 140,000 installs over the last two years and we saw a nice gain in customers this year. We certainly expect a significant pickup from those 82,000 customers that were installed this year. It will probably be well over 50,000 new customers next year. We expect the margins – the customer growth from new customers with a slowing of the acceleration of the installs, we plan to see [inaudible] in the margin [inaudible]. If installs flatten you certainly don’t get the hit incrementally. We don’t mind taking that hit because there is certainly long term growth in that business and it certainly has the potential to grow their revenues in double digits next year.

Joe Box – Keybanc Capital Markets, Inc.

It’s basically just a customer acquisition cost anyway?

Harry J. Cynkus

Yes, exactly.

Gary W. Rollins

If I could add, keep in mind retention is better on these customers than it is conventional pest control so there’s really an ongoing benefit to grow this business just beyond the initial install.

Joe Box – Keybanc Capital Markets, Inc.

Harry, earlier your cost breakdown was helpful and I know it’s going to be tough to predict if some of those fees and headwinds are going to repeat themselves in 2014. Can you guys just give us a sense of how we should be thinking about SG&A either on a run rate or percentage basis for 2014?

Harry J. Cynkus

I think SG&A this year was certainly a little elevated by the decision we made with our new advertising campaign to step up our advertising cost. We won’t see that same percentage gain next year. Unless the plan changes, and it certainly can, we are constantly looking at the trends, and leads and adjust our advertising strategy as necessary. But I would think, looking into the year, it should return to more what I would say normal levels unless there are some opportunities to pour fuel on the fire.

The acquisition cost in the fourth quarter – doing our first acquisition in Australia cost us a lot more than a second acquisition would cost us doing there. There was a lot of fact finding and a lot of additional work and due diligence scoping out the market and getting comfortable with everything. But typically acquisition costs falls in the same year as the revenue comes on board. In this case, we had some time between the signing of the agreement and the closing of the deal. The deal should close mid February.

The deal there is there are certain things we couldn’t do until the deal became public. We had to get the bank council and then go to the bank, set up new payroll systems, and transfer contracts, and what not. If I had a big acquisition cost in first quarter or second quarter you’d hope you’d see revenue and profits following it down the road. So, this year was a little different where we had the acquisition cost and most of it is accrued because it’s been incurred but the acquisition won’t fall – we’ll see part of it in the first quarter.

Joe Box – Keybanc Capital Markets, Inc.

On the cap ex front can you maybe just give us some color on expectations for 2014? Maybe some high level thoughts on free cash flow? One thing I’m looking at is will there be any cash tax impact from the expiration of bonus depreciation?

Harry J. Cynkus

With regard to expiration bonus, I mean, we just don’t have a lot of depreciation. Our cap ex last year was $19 million and I would say that was a big year for us. This year, we’re still working on the biggest capital expenditure which is the [inaudible] suite project. We’re still spending money on that. It should be slowing down because we’ll be into the implementation phase before the year is out. I would say on cap ex $15 to $20 million is probably the range it will fall in and if you look historically that’s about what we spend. The bonus depreciation shouldn’t have as that significant an impact to really weigh on anything.

Joe Box – Keybanc Capital Markets, Inc.

On the free cash flow side we should basically be about growing by how much net income grows?

Harry J. Cynkus

Yes. Then we’ll certainly have the addition from the margins of the acquisition and we’re always looking – we’re not satisfied with matching our results next year so free cash flow will raise with the profit. It won’t affect EBITDA and free cash flow – we don’t know yet we’re still working with the valuation people with regards to the All Pest acquisition. At this point I don’t know how much of the purchase price will be allocated to goodwill verses intangible assets which impacts the amortization. So it impacts EPS but it is all free cash flow post acquisition and we’ll have more color on that hopefully by the end of first quarter here.

You’re next question comes from Sun-Il Kim – RBC Capital Markets, LLC.

Sun-Il Kim – RBC Capital Markets, LLC

First of all just one follow up to one of Joe’s questions regarding SG&A expenses. If I sort of add up what you consider sort of one-time items in 2013 whether it’s the advertising campaign, I think you had some consulting fees earlier last year, and I guess some acquisition related cost, if I add those up it seems like you probably had about 30 to 50 basis points impact on margins last year from those items. Is it safe to assume that you’re getting that back in 2014? It doesn’t seem like you’re going to have any more consulting fees, it seems like the advertising campaign is going normal so are we going to automatically see 30 to 50 basis points of expansion this year just from those items going away?

Harry J. Cynkus

I would think Sun if you did your math right, and I can’t verify your math right now I’m sitting at home, last night I didn’t expect not to be able to get back in the office so I don’t have any of my worksheets and spreadsheets with me. But you are correct, the consulting project, those fees were all related to our pricing initiative and we’re past the consultation standpoint and are now in the implementation. The advertising spend will return to normalized level again, unless we decide we see a market opportunity and acquisition expenses is tied to acquisition. So yes, it would normalize unless something not normal comes up. It’s hard to predict sitting here but certainly nothing on the immediate horizon that we have to talk about.

Sun-Il Kim – RBC Capital Markets, LLC

Just one more question, regarding All Pest, I know you guys haven’t closed the deal yet but can you sort of talk about what the seasonality of that business is? I know there’s a lot of exposure to the oil and gas industry. If we’re going to model this in at some point I just want to know how we should think about the seasonality as well as the growth trajectory of All Pest?

Harry J. Cynkus

The company, interestingly from a seasonality standpoint, their seasons run 180 degrees different from ours in that they’re on the other side of the equator down under. It’s summer right now so we’re sitting here freezing and having ice in Atlanta Georgia and it’s somewhere between 90 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit down in Perth today. They are in the height of their season so interestingly to some degree, and they’re certainly not anywhere as large, but they’ll help us smooth out some of our seasonality that we’ve been reporting on.

In terms of growth, we’re really not in a position to talk about that just now. About half of their business is tied into oil and gas industry. They do a lot of work around the biosecurity of these huge liquefied natural gas projects that are going on in Western Australia. Their revenues spike up at the front end of the project while the items at these plants and things are being built and then it drops off into a normalized rate. The big question is how many more of these contracts – there are other projects that are being bid on, there are other projects that are at the front end of the cycle. Some projects have slowed down, others are picking up.

They grew, I want to say I think the number was in excess of 30% revenue growth they experienced last year. In the last six months of the business this year it slowed a little for them. I think we modeled very modest first year growth as we try to get our hands around it and figure it out but a lot of it has to do with the timing of the contracts which quite frankly we haven’t had as much familiarity with at this point. We have an [inaudible] who is in the process of relocating his family to Australia. He has been down there for the due diligence. I spoke to him about 5:30 this morning, 6:30 his time and he had a full day of meetings with customers. He’s been meeting with customers now for the last two weeks.

We’re just getting and wrapping our hands around all of it. He’s having employee meetings like the customer meetings. His report is extremely enthusiastic. The customers have wonderful relations and have just given us glowing reports about the relationships and the quality of the work that has been performed and are happy to hear that it is our intent to keep the full team there and in place. We’re just bringing our balance sheet, our contacts, and looking to find ways to grow and improve the business.

Prospects are wonderful I just don’t know how to model it yet. I know next week or two weeks after this deal closes the first question I get from Gary when I get back from Australia is, “Where’s the budget?”

Gary W. Rollins

I may not wait that long there. One thing maybe noteworthy, we have a sister company RPC which is in the oil service business, another public company and they have two divisions working in Australia so we were able to kind of validate from a third-party that this oil/gas situation is going to be pretty sustainable because they have these contracts with China to deliver gas and they’re just scrambling down there to get the infrastructure in down there to meet those obligations. Of course, the infrastructure is building those dormitories and treating the materials that come in to make sure there are no pests and so forth. I think we felt more comfortable that this think was not going to be just kind of a blip.

Dan Dolev – Jefferies, LLC.

It looks like when you hire the new person in charge of M&A is there a limit to the size that you’re looking at when you’re looking at M&A? Secondly, would you be potentially willing to take on debt if you found something right that fit?

Harry J. Cynkus

We would certainly be willing to take on debt and we have in the past so there’s not any limit. The big ones are harder to catch but we feel like we’ve improved our imitative dramatically and we’ll be turning up the calls we make on these prospects. The Obama Care is looming out there and we’re getting calls from some people that are very concerned about what that is going to do with their cost and cash flow so we’re pretty encouraged about the direction as far as the new year is concerned.

Dan Dolev – Jefferies, LLC.

Is there a limit to the geographic focus for M&A? Is this now just Australia or basically anything anywhere in the world is on the table right now?

Harry J. Cynkus

We’re really not as interested in international acquisition as we are domestic. I think this Australian thing was pretty unique. We feel like our model, as far as franchises is concerned internationally as far as the cultural challenges, and the language, and other regulatory issues, etc. – so this isn’t an indication that we’re just going to go out and try and accumulate a bunch of companies. But this Australian situation just fit for us and we have other opportunities in Australia. We’re on the west coast, certainly the east coast has potential and we’re making contacts in those other areas.
