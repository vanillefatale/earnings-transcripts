Question-and-Answer Section

Operator

Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from the line of Clinton Fendley with Davenport. Please go ahead.

Clinton Fendley – Davenport & Company Llc

Good morning Gary and Harry, a nice quarter.

Harry J. Cynkus

Thank you.

Gary W. Rollins

Thank you.

Clinton Fendley – Davenport & Company Llc

Gary, I wondered, a typical Q2 is the time that you guys evaluate your pricing and any potential increases. I wondered if you could update us on your expectations for this year in light of the challenging market environment?

Gary W. Rollins

Well, we have been doing testing as far as our annual residential price increase, and commercial price increases and we’ve confirmed that we have opportunities in that regard. We are very pleased with the results of our testing. But felt like we really needed to do that, as you mentioned in light of the economic situation. And we will be initiating those this coming month. And we are looking forward to the successful effort, I can’t really get into more details, for obvious reasons about exactly what our strategies are, but we were pleased with the results of our test.

Clinton Fendley – Davenport & Company Llc

Okay, thank you. And any update on just the competitive environment out there, and what you are seeing from both some of the smaller as well as larger competitors in the market?

Gary W. Rollins

Well I think it, the smaller competitors are certainly suffering, they don’t have the quite, they don’t have the diversification that we have the different markets that we are in. But, the industry information just indicates that the industry is scrambling. I think the fact that when gas went up, as high as it did, it was really dramatic to the competitors. And we’re very hopeful that we will see an increase of people that are interested in selling their business, we’ve seen some uptick, but to-date we don’t have anything to show for it. I think that, people accounted in a catch 22 their expenses are not going down, they really know if they start discounting, and I guess that’s the natural tendency, when you are not getting that many phone calls to cut your prices, but, they don’t have any other expenses with the exception of gasoline that’s gone down. So, they really are on the horns of a dilemma.

Clinton Fendley – Davenport & Company Llc

Okay, that’s helpful. Thank you guys.

Operator

Thank you (Operator Instructions). And our next question is from the line of James Clement with Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.

James Clement – Sidoti & Company

Gray, Harry. Good morning.

Gary W. Rollins

Good morning.

Harry J. Cynkus

Good morning.

James Clement – Sidoti & Company

Gray, if I could, you alluded to advertising and marketing a little bit in your prepared remarks and it seems like, in this environment where advertising costs are generally speaking down across the Board, the company is, in good financial shape, weren’t you guys either or able to spend a little less get the same kind of penetration or they spend the same amount and arguably get much better penetration, get better spots on TV et cetera. What’s the role you guys are taking this year?

Gary W. Rollins

Well, we will have a slight increase as far as the dollars that we are expecting to spend. I mean, we certainly plan for that, but as you mentioned, we are seeing for the first time some fairly attractive rate decreases, I mean, we don’t, we are not compelled to spend every dollar that we budgeted. But we are enjoying to see some benefits for the fact that the major advertisers are really feeling the same pain that a lot of businesses are seeing. We continue to work very closely on our Internet presence. But, I guess to kind of sum it up we’re just enjoying the fact that, that people that we’ve been calling on for years and purchasing advertising, are willing to come off of their rate card.

James Clement – Sidoti & Company

Sure, sure now that’s consistent with what we have heard. With respect to the termite business, I think over the last year or so from what I understand the profitability results have trended very well, on top line performance, nothing related to right home about one way or the other, but this quarter looked pretty good. Can you talk a little about what you’ve done with that business and kind of what the goals are in, whether you maybe have turned the corner here?

Gary W. Rollins

Well, we are very encouraged with the results we have selectively added sales managers in our larger commercial branches, which always makes the difference. We have improved and expanded our sales training. Jamie, you followed us for along time and, we kind of fought the termite wars back in the 90s and cautiously we’ve really kind of unintentionally, we emphasize that part of our business, but I think, we’re always a leader as far as termite sales were concerned prior to that situation and we’ve just got back into the termite sales business. And I think that our managers some of which are young enough that they did not experience the benefits to the profit and loss statements when they had a good termite month. Really you are seeing the benefits that the termite really contributes to the bottom line because you get that infusion of profitability immediately as opposed to pest control or you really have to wait several months before you see a favorable impact on the bottom line.

Harry J. Cynkus

And Gary my understanding is that the science behind termite treatment is better than now than it was in the 1990s. Would you agree with that?

Gary W. Rollins


All the materials are better, and that’s kind of hitting the nutshell. We went through a period of timing the entire industry did. The only products that were available for so many years were just partially affected that when [boarding] was withdrawn from the market, they weren’t anything really suitable as from an effectiveness position and certainly we did know all that, but the reality is that there is very good products out there now and we got a lot smarter as a result of sometimes diversity can be a good thing. And I think it just caused us to redouble our training efforts and really become more expert as far as controlling termites.

James Clement – Sidoti & Company

Okay. Thank you. My last question is are you able to share anything about some of the Middle Eastern franchises that were opened up last year or any of them up in running and any updates can be given there?

Gary W. Rollins

We are very pleased with the progress that we are making over there, in fact we are, for the first time really, infusing some of those franchises with Orkin, people on the ground so to speak, our business does increase, our ability to I guess to have [closures] involvement as far as the franchises are concerned, that has improved, but we also, we got that $25 million contractor, our franchise did in Saudi Arabia...

Harry J. Cynkus

As you know there are member of U.K. they are doing well.

Gary W. Rollins

Yeah UAE and is doing well and we just had our VP of franchising go over there and he was very pleased with what was taking places as far as the franchisees ability to execute on that contract.

James Clement – Sidoti & Company

Okay, thank you all very much for your time.

Gary W. Rollins

Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to management for any closing comments.

Gary W. Rollins

Okay, well I hope that silence indicates that you all are pleased with our results. We certainly are pleased. We appreciate you joining us today. As Harry indicated we remain cautiously optimistic concerning the balance of the year. We are working hard to grow our business organically and through our acquisitions and we will always have our eye on the bottom line.

We look forward to speaking with you all again in next quarter. Thank you.
