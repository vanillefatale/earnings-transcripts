Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator instructions] Our first question is coming from Tim Mulrooney of William Blair. Please go ahead.

Tim Mulrooney

John. Thanks for that excellent history of your termite service.

John Wilson

You're welcome.

Tim Mulrooney

A couple questions on organic growth. So, the first one, on your commercial pests organic growth, it picked up in the fourth quarter, despite a more difficult comparison with last year. Can you talk a little bit more about your commercial pest business, what's maybe helping drive that acceleration? All else equal, we kind of expected your commercial business to continue to normalize back towards your historical range, but instead it picked up a little bit here. So just curious, what's going on?

Jerry Gahlhoff

This is Jerry, Tim. A lot of the commercial sales growth is a result of the investment that we've made in the staffing. We saw an opportunity to capitalize on the rebound and we began upstaffing in that amongst our commercial sales team over a year ago during when things were still rough, we were investing in the business and getting people up to speed and ramped up so that we would be ready for the rebound and we've just basically been able to capitalize on that.

John Wilson

Yeah, Tim, and this is John. I might add that our commercial sales success was driven by both categories. And when I say both, I mean, local sales efforts, that's our local branches with feed on the street, adding accounts, but also our national accounts and I'm going off of memory. So forgive me if I'm off a little bit, but our national account sales effort for December was up some 50% or close to it. That indicates a lot of business being let out forbid to start the new year. But we were up in that one little month for by 50%. So pretty pleased with that.

Tim Mulrooney

That's really helpful color. Thanks guys. And I apologize for this next question, but there's a lot of numbers and perhaps misinformation being thrown around right now. So I just want to clarify. You guys revised your organic growth estimates. For the first half of 2021, you gave us that excellent table in your press release and you revised it to exclude all acquisitions, not just the significant acquisitions and by our math, it looks like the difference between the old definition of organic growth and the new definition is about 1% for the first half of 2021, the only periods in which we have both numbers.

Is that also how you see it, that those bolt-ons added about one percentage point to revenue growth and do you think that that's a typical thing?

Julie Bimmerman

I'd say that yes, I'd agree to your numbers and what you're saying on that front. A lot of it, as far as typical, it honestly depends on the, how many acquisitions are closing. When are they closing? What are the sizes of the acquisitions closing? So know it is not always, the 1% there's many times when it is lower. The only time when we see anything that would be high would be a large acquisition, like, Clark.

John Wilson

Yeah, I would add that it, maybe it was typical for this year, Tim, but it's not always like that. So, we just -- we just never know. I think the benefit is -- kind of it with all extracted. Now it gives us a clearer picture.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mario Cortellacci of Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Mario Cortellacci

Hi. Really appreciate the time. I guess my question is just around your labor availability. And forgive me if I misheard it at the beginning of the call, but I know you added some color around maybe your completions, but maybe you can just talk to how the labor availability is impacting the business and how you guys are working through it.

Is this just something where you're, you're obviously paying these people more, but maybe you can also talk about the impact, the higher wages for the service of the business could potentially have on 2022 margins?

John Wilson

So Mario, let me take a stab at it first. And maybe Jerry will have something to add. So you'll recall in previous quarters as this was maybe a building issue. We talked about most of our pay plans are productivity driven. So the more work they produce, the more they earn. And so while we're certainly turning over more than our norm our people are still pretty well paid and we are getting the more placed. And so getting to the lion share of our work, we have very little of it that's fallen through the cracks.

So no doubt, it's a tough environment. Our people, I've used the term turnover, a lot of rocks before our people are having to turn over a lot of rocks to find new people. But as we talked about in our leadership meeting, that Jerry referenced week, the best course of action is not to lose them in the first place, right? Keep them engaged, keep them happy and not lose them. And then you're not bearing that cost of replacing them.

So we are seeing some inflation pressure on a few of our jobs, and most notably our termite service technicians, those are, are typically hourly and we've had to up our pay rates in some markets, but, but we're still getting people and we're getting to, to the line, share of our work.

Jerry Gahlhoff

I would add as you look, as we look forward to 2022, we're really emphasizing to our managers about how much more time they need to spend on recruiting efforts as it's, if it may be that we have to spend as a hiring manager, you may have to spend two hours of your day, every day, focused on recruiting and hiring and on-boarding efforts. It's really an adjustment of how our managers have to spend our time in this changing environment. And that's a big part of what we look at and that's our -- that's a big part of our solution to how we handle this in the coming year.

Mario Cortellacci

Yeah. And I think you guys have done a good job with managing cost and seeing margin expansion through different points in the cycle. But I guess just for 2022 and I understand that you guys don't guide, but just thinking about 2022, do you guys think you can continue the same type of historical performance with margin expansion?

John Wilson

That's certainly our expectation.

Mario Cortellacci

Got it. And then just the,

Jerry Gahlhoff

I'm sorry, go ahead. I was just to say that, this is Jerry. I said, that's what -- that's what we strive to do; Always looking to get better.

Mario Cortellacci

Okay. And then just the last one from me you guys have obviously heard about the large deal going on in the space whether it gets completed or it doesn't get completed, but if it go through and I guess just maybe how are you guys thinking about the impact, the competition within the space?

I don't know if execution on their side creates opportunity for you, does a larger player impact your ability to win new business. Obviously you guys have invested in your Salesforce heavily over the past year, but and that probably sets you up better, but any thoughts around kind of the competitive dynamics and how they shift if the deal goes through?

Gary Rollins

Well we we've been competing with, both concerns. We think that there's going to be a lot of work to be done on with a merger of that size, which really provides opportunity. As the term oil really has typically generated turnover as far as customers are concerned. And certainly employees are concerned many will enjoy the new relationships, but others will not. So we look at it as it, an opportunity, but that doesn't really take our eye off of our business. Cause in the end that's really what matters.

Jerry Gahlhoff

Yeah. Mr. Rollins at the end of the, we haven't spent a lot of time talking about it, have we? It's -- it is not been high on our radar screen. We focus on what we do and getting the results that we get, and that's where we put our efforts.

Gary Rollins

And it works.

Jerry Gahlhoff

That's right.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ashish Sabra of RBC Markets, please go ahead.

Ashish Sabra

Thanks for taking my question. There was a reference to a rate card increase for the termite business. I was wondering if you could talk about how the pricing is trending and is there an opportunity to flex higher than your traditional 1% to 2% as we go into 2022? Thanks.

Jerry Gahlhoff

The beauty of -- this is Jerry. The beauty of a rate card increases that unlike just a price increase to a recurring customer is that we can adjust that with a lot of flexibility in fairly real time. So if we saw a material increase in cost by X percent, we can, and pretty quickly in our rate card, moving forward, just increase our entire rate card to cover those that increase in expenses or whatever we deem necessary.

And we can use the same, not only in materials and supplies, but also if we're experiencing some labor challenges or whatever, we can make those adjustments and usually make those adjustments within a week or so of us doing the analysis and figuring that out. So it's a little bit different than our recurring, like say as control or some sort of contract based revenue, price increase. It's a different model.

Ashish Sabra

That's really helpful color. Maybe if I can just ask a quick follow up on that point itself. Can you just talk about which all businesses have cards? I, you, you obviously mentioned the termite but there what are other businesses where you may also have a similar rate card?

Jerry Gahlhoff

Everything has a right card.

John Wilson

If we acquire a business that doesn't, we put one in pretty quickly. We want to bring structure and kind of logic to our pricing and everything we do,

Gary Rollins

John that's how, yeah, this is Gary, if I could add over the years, we've gotten fairly sophisticated in our rate cards and our price increases and so forth. It sounds like it's pretty simple, but we look at where the customer is currently, what they're currently charging when they've last had an increase the market, the competition and so forth.

So, I think John made a great point. That's probably the first thing that we really address when we do make an acquisition. Typically competitors are, are slow to raise their rates. And we were historically, I mean, we had the same situation, but as we increased rates over the years and added the sophistication and data we've been and good at it. And it's really a margin contributor when we buy a Company

Ashish Sabra

That's very helpful color. And if I could ask my second question around as you talked about the, in some of the inflationary or the employee turnover is is affecting everyone in the industry, obviously Orkin's given your brand a strong brand presence. You've been able to manage it much better versus maybe the long tail and given how fragmented the best control industry is, it potentially might be affecting the private players or the smaller players a lot more than Orkin's.

And so my question there was how that help Orkin's, does that help you in terms of your growth potential, but also does it -- has that been a positive tailor from a M&A perspective? Does it open up more opportunities for M&A as some of these private or smaller players are unable to handle these inflationary pressures? Thanks.

Jerry Gahlhoff

This is Jerry. There's no doubt that the Orkin brand and the brand presence, the amount of marketing you see on television, on various social media, how they go to market, has helped their employment brand as well, to make them that Employer of Choice in our industry.

And certainly they -- I'm not saying they have an easier, easy time, but they have maybe a little bit of an easier time because they do have such a strong brand and such strong brand recognition from an employment standpoint. There's certainly that, that type of tailwind that they get, there's no doubt, compared to say a, a small Mom-and-Pop Company, something along those lines. We, we definitely have some advantages there.

Ashish Sabra

That's helpful. And then just, if you could talk about the M&A, how is that helpful helping you from an M&A perspective you are of the ability to acquire some of these smaller private companies, which may be struggling with this inflation of the environment?

John Wilson

Yeah. So this, this is John. What I would say to that is that may be certainly a factor in their decision making kind of process to sell or not sell. I think what we saw last year, more than anything was concern over taxes and what was going to happen with that. So, I would think that that say that was a bigger factor.

Ashish Sabra

That's very helpful color. Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go ahead.

Michael Hoffman

Hi everybody. Thank you for taking the questions this morning. So, mine comes back to growth and will you share and help us understand what composes the underlying organic growth and in a perfect world to be by line of business, but can you give us a sense of how we should think about breaking up the growth and between price, new customer ads, cross selling and where I'm going with that is you, the underlying industry growth, every on all the rate the trade groups, what have you say it's 5% roughly. So you've been growing substantially organically, substantially greater than that. Now for several years, you're not little as a Company. I'm trying to understand where's that sustainability of that, is it at the high-end a 100% or does it start easing back towards more like 50% and why?

John Wilson

So, Michael, this is John. Let me kind of take a stab at what you're asking and then we'll go from there. So I'll start with the termite business. And we had kind of been in a long slow slide in terms of our termite customer base had been going down for many years. Part of that was by design.

As we experienced some of the termite claims issues, that I mentioned that the -- during my piece, we moved the mix of, of business. So, we were up over 20% when that started. And I think we're now at around 17 for termite, but our termite customer base has started increasing. The last two years, we're adding to our customer base. And so that's, driving a big piece of it there as new customers, as it is in all of our segments.

We're adding we added I forget the number exactly from 2020, but some, 60,000 new customers for our residential pest control group just in, or, and alone. And, the same has happening for commercial. So the lion share is, is of new with new customer additions. Keeping them just the [indiscernible] longer, always helps as well. And then we're still kind of historically at that 1% or so that we can point to and say, it's price. Anything to add Jerry, I don't…

Jerry Gahlhoff

I would say if you're looking at the, the difference, what the difference is, it's really when you're improved your customer retention rate, and you are adding customers at a higher rates than you had historically, then you get the kind of growth that we get. Those are the main drivers.

Michael Hoffman

Okay, fair enough. And, I get the investment in people and training and what you've done to make this a better run business. How long can you sustain that wide of a gap to the underlying market growth?

Jerry Gahlhoff

We're going to keep trying, we're going to keep working on it.

John Wilson

Hey, Michael, we, our plan for 2022 is built on doing better than what we did in '21. So, we don't, we don't know, I guess it's probably the easy answer, but it's certainly our intention to keep chipping at it.

Michael Hoffman

Okay. And then Gary, you did make an in, I think it was Gary made an inference that you thought taxes drove M&A, so taxes have been put to bed. I think it would appear that we've pretty much got gridlocks. So do you expect the pace to slow or does the challenges around labor and inflation and what have you create an incremental catalyst and therefore the M&A outlook remains as promising is it was in '21?

Jerry Gahlhoff

Yeah, Michael. So that was me, that John didn’t mentioned that. And you're right. I mean, as the year wore on it got less and less maybe certain that that tax law would change. Hopefully, hopefully we're at gridlock with it. I and that, and on that subject but, but it may well happen that, that some of the other challenges, whether it's just the day to day running the business and the costs, different things, that's inflation, that's going on and buying products or whatever. They'll all add up to a continued acquisition market. We think that's kind of the case.

Gary Rollins

And we started the year out with acquisition potential deals in the hopper. So that's a good sign as well.

Operator

Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.

Gary Rollins

Well, thank you. We appreciate your support and interest in Rollins. Before we close, I'd like to share that Dr. Tom Lawley has decided to retire from service on our board at the end of his current firm, on behalf of our board and our entire team and myself, we'd like to recognize and thank Dr. Lawley for everything that he's done for our organization over the last 16 years.

I don't believe he's ever missed a meeting. And his contribution's mirror is distinction distinguished service with Emory. Tom, you will be missed. Rollins is excited about our opportunities for growth in 2022. And we look forward to sharing our progress during our first quarter conference call in April. Thank you again,

Operator
