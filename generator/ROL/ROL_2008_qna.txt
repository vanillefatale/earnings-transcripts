Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Thank you sir. (Operator instructions) And our first question is from the line of Jamie Famalette with Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.

Jamie Famalette – Sidoti & Company

Gary, Harry. Good morning.

Gary Rollins

Good morning.

Harry Cynkus

Good morning.

Jamie Famalette – Sidoti & Company

Harry, I'm not sure I saw this in the release and I don't recall you mentioning it in your prepared remarks what was CapEx all in for 2008, do you have an approximate number?

Harry Cynkus

Including CapEx from acquisitions it was right around $15 million.

Jamie Famalette – Sidoti & Company

And is – pardon me, a rough guess for what 2009 might look like?

Harry Cynkus

I would give you a range right now $14 million to $18 million.

Jamie Famalette – Sidoti & Company

Okay, so it is similar, all right.

Harry Cynkus

Similar.

Jamie Famalette – Sidoti & Company

Thank you and Gary, you spent a little bit of time talking about the franchise programs earlier in your prepared remarks, can you talk a little bit about the differentiation between your strategy within North America versus outside of North America and obviously you mentioned Kuwait, I was just curious for your thoughts.

Gary Rollins

Well it is quite a different. In the United States or North America we only will select proven pest control operators as franchisees. Most (inaudible) these are working alone now. We have always you know, before the franchise program lost 6 or 7 managers because they just wanted to go into business for themselves and pursue their entrepreneurial spirit. And so we have a pretty good stream of franchisees and as a result they are familiar with Orkin, they keep their uniform; they keep their vehicles on their own vehicles et cetera. So it is a very smooth transition and we also have a kind of a guaranteed buyback situation at different milestone dates, 7 years, 10 years, something in that nature.

They are required to sell their business to us at a predetermined price and this really works well for both sides because quite often these people are, you know, by the time they get into the program are in their 50s or early 60s and they are really looking for an exit to the business as well and they've got a guaranteed purchaser. This represents, I guess, about 32 – they do about $32 million you know, we had a couple each year. They pay us the 6% royalty and subsidize some other things like advertising and training. The domestic, I mean the international dealers is quite different in that we are looking for successful business people in these foreign locations typically people that are in service related industries, janitorial or cleaning business, route delivery type businesses.

Recently, one I think the Turkey franchisee was in the snack food delivery business. People that kind of understand getting a service person to the right place at the right time and of course, we take our money. We are not copartners. On the start ups, you know, they are given fixed amounts that they have to pay us and then after they mature they get more on a percentage basis.

Jamie Famalette – Sidoti & Company

Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate that and I will get back in the queue, thanks.

Gary Rollins

Okay, thanks.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Clint Fendley with Davenport & Company. Please go ahead.

Clint Fendley – Davenport & Company

Thank you. Good morning Gary and Harry.

Gary Rollins

Good morning Clint.

Clint Fendley – Davenport & Company

The first question, the pension accrual on the balance sheet any thoughts Harry as to the timing and amount of any potential cash contribution to your?

Harry Cynkus

We have been contributing $5 million a year for each of the last several years. We are working with our actuary now to determine clearly what the requirements will be in ’09 that we went from an actuary overfunded status to about 86% funded status and you know, we need to make some long-term decisions in terms of sourcing that gap, the government's laws have changed in terms of requirements. We do still have some credits available. So I can say the contribution won’t be less than $5 million that is clear. Whether we will need to increase it to $10 million hasn't been determined. It will take probably at least 5 and I don't know how much more but it shouldn’t be dramatic in terms of a demand in our free cash flow.

Clint Fendley – Davenport & Company

Okay, great thank you. That is helpful and then I may have missed it but the DSOs for the quarter, were there any noticeable changes there?

Harry Cynkus

No, you know the – I don't have it right handy but it is less than I think we are actually at decreases in some of the operations but in the largest of operations, Orkin, it was up less than a day.

Clint Fendley – Davenport & Company

Okay great and the final question, any idea as to the EPS benefit that we might have for 2009 if the fuel prices stayed at this level for the entire year?

Harry Cynkus

It stays at this level, let us say, that is going out on the limb, as volatile as it has been but it is – in terms of EPS if the – I can give you a range because I wish I could tell you what fuel is going to do but anywhere from $0.03 to $0.07 impact. It is – I just don't feel comfortable projecting fuel prices. Lot of people lost lot of money last year.

Clint Fendley – Davenport & Company

Understood. Thank you and good job in a very difficult climate here. Thanks guys.

Gary Rollins

Thank you.

Operator

(Operator instructions)

Gary Rollins

Harry, I hope this is a good sign.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of (inaudible) pardon me, I am sorry, Garo Naruein [ph] with Blackrock. Please go ahead.

Garo Naruein – Blackrock

Hi, I just wanted to ask a little bit more about this acquisitions environment and it sounds like there is certainly an increase on the conversations perhaps going on and I want to get sense of as far as prices paid, how does that compare today versus maybe 12 months ago over a longer period of history?

Gary Rollins

Well, you know, the fuel cost earlier climbed early in the year startled a lot of operators and had them come and take a harder look about whether they need to this was the time to sell or not. We saw a kind of an uptick at that point and of course from an economic point of view there is nothing and really has taken place it has been favorable. So I think there is definitely a lot more people, we are getting more enquiries. I think we have proven ourselves to be the acquirer of choice because we really are not heavy-handed with the company that the companies that we acquire. So, you know, we've got great references when they contact Western or even as recently as HomeTeam. So, we are very optimistic. We think that there are a lot of people that – this is just kind of the push that they need to make the sale decision. Price-wise, I think prices have gone down. Some of the people that were spending money – in our determination fairly loosely are no longer pursuing acquisitions. You know, we pretty much held to our guns and didn't feel like we could chase some of the amounts that were being paid. So I really think that we pretty much – we are in a good position that you know, to really buy some of these businesses at a very good value.

Garo Naruein – Blackrock

Great and just historically what kind of multiples have you guys had.

Gary Rollins

The business is kind of funny because typically it has been sold on a multiple of revenue. You know, there is quite a bit of (inaudible) in some of these smaller companies and multiples of revenues have been kind of the way that businesses have been placed. Our models are far more sophisticated than that. We really look at what is going to happen to the business after we own it and so there is a lot of things that really kind of determine our value, how profitable it is at that time, what are some of the expenses that are going to disappear when a person sells and so, you know, I think you can convert that if you wanted to kind of back into the percentage of revenue that could be probably anywhere from $0.80 to maybe $1.10. But typically historically once you restate the amount to the EBITDA, 6 to 7 times EBITDA and obviously there are variations in that.

Garo Naruein – Blackrock

Great, thanks very much.

Gary Rollins

Thank you.

Operator

Thank you, our next question is from the line of Patrick Stowe with Priority Capital. Please go ahead.

Patrick Stowe – Priority Capital

Thanks, good morning.

Gary Rollins

Good morning.

Patrick Stowe – Priority Capital

I just wanted to clarify; did you say that termite claims were down 40% year-over-year?

Gary Rollins

That is correct.

Patrick Stowe – Priority Capital

So that – does that make it $7.5 million for the year?

Harry Cynkus

Yes.

Patrick Stowe – Priority Capital

Any idea what the provision for ’09 on that will be? I'm just looking back I mean in 2006 that was a $17 million charge. So, obviously it has dropped significantly.

Gary Rollins

Yes and the provision should match pretty close in ’09 we expect to claim levels and we are hoping that and looking to reduce the number of claims in ‘09 from ‘08. I don't think we can expect another 40% reduction but by the same token the number of new claims last year was down significantly from the year before, the number of open claims was down as well. So, we think the number should continue to trend down but certainly we can’t keep that pace up.

Patrick Stowe – Priority Capital

I mean is it just an issue where the old termite applications aren’t really as much of an issue any more? And what are the trends driving that really?

Gary Rollins

I think the largest trend is that back in the late 90s we went from lifetime repair contracts to term contracts and you know, we've been able to do a good job in matching the efficacy of the contract with the term of the contract, and you know as a result we're seeing a reduction. In addition you know based on lot of actuarial work that we did as we felt a matrix. So we're much more – much smarter in imagining the risks that we will incur soon. We know what home type constructions are problematic and what not. So lot of work over the years that have all contributed to the trend.

Patrick Stowe – Priority Capital

Well I appreciate the color and good luck to you.

Gary Rollins

Thank you.

Harry Cynkus

Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. (Operator instructions)

Gary Rollins

Well, thank you all for joining today's call and your interest in Rollins and we look forward to participate. We have a late question, okay.

Operator

Excuse me, would you like to take the questions sir?

Gary Rollins

Yes.

Operator

That question is from the line of Tom Quinn [ph] with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Tom Quinn – Deutsche Bank

Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Two quick ones. How do your contracts work if a restaurant has a chain and they close a few units, you get revenue per store or just the contract stays the same?

Gary Rollins

We would lose the revenues that went with the stores that closed.

Tom Quinn – Deutsche Bank

Okay. And the –

Gary Rollins

I like it your way though. It is better. We can’t get them to stand for that.

Tom Quinn – Deutsche Bank

Okay and then you know I have listened to lot of conference calls where you know, lot of managements talk about how bad the economy is and they are going line by line through their costs trying to reduce some, and I understand in your business how you know it is contractually set up and how regulations have acquired your services in some cases but have any businesses come back to you not trying to cancel or anything like that but just trying to ask for a better price?

Gary Rollins

Oh sure. I mean you know typical national – national accounts you know do. We have a little bit of room in that we can if it's a non-food type of account it has no food sales or service or whatever we can make some adjustments sometimes with the service frequency because you know, you can certainly under some circumstances if they have no pest and we've remedied their pest problems and we sometimes can look at if there are twice a month customers sometimes we can reduce that to once a month but we're not involved in any price reductions or anything of that nature I mean it's just taken a long time to get our prices up and so we're pretty firm about holding the line.

Tom Quinn – Deutsche Bank

Okay, all right. Thank you very much.

Gary Rollins

Thank you.

Operator

Thank you and we do have a question from the line of Andrew Mahoney [ph] with Green Arrow [ph]. Please go ahead.

Andrew Mahoney – Green Arrow

Hi, thanks. Actually I just have one question. Can you quantify what earnings per share accretion were from the HomeTeam acquisition in 2008?

Harry Cynkus

No. We typically don't break up the earnings of our various operating divisions but it was as we mentioned mildly accretive.

Andrew Mahoney – Green Arrow

Okay, and cost synergies should accelerate in 2009 for that one property, the acquisition?

Harry Cynkus

Yes, we have – as we said in some previous calls you know we set out a four-year plan and model that we believe we could bring their margins up to equal to what the margins in our other operating businesses are excluding the impact of the intangibles and they are operating well ahead of schedule and we believe we have opportunities to further improve their margins.

Andrew Mahoney – Green Arrow

Okay thank you.

Operator

Thank you and there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn it back to management for any closing comments.

Gary Rollins
