Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of George Kelly with ROTH Capital Partners. Please proceed with your questions.

George Kelly

Hey everybody, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe I'll start with a couple on pricing. I was curious if you could break down your growth in 4Q by pricing and volume? And then I think you said in your prepared remarks that you had either just taken pricing or you were planning on taking pricing. And I'm curious if I heard that right and how much additional pricing you plan taking.

Adam Michaels

Yeah, thanks, George. So, your question on pricing, so actually probably 90%, definitely over 85% of our revenue growth was volume driven. So really important. We are a volume driven business. We look at pricing every day. This is not something we do once a year or once a quarter seasonally. Every day, we're looking at what's happening in the markets from a commodity perspective and immediately, it's a big learning from when I first got here. We take immediate action and we actually anticipate what's going on. So we've taken pricing, some of that pricing has been implemented already, some is going to be happening throughout the course of the month, the next two months. And again, we're clear and we really see our customers as partners. They see the same data we do, if not, we certainly share it with them. This is all readily available data on the price of beef and chicken. And when beef or chicken start to move, we immediately say, look, we need another $0.10, we need another $0.20, whatever that number is. And we work collaboratively on that. So hopefully that's helpful.

George Kelly

And just sort of round numbers or just ballparking, would this be all in like a loaded mid-single-digit pricing increase? If you look at it.

Adam Michaels

No, fortunately or unfortunately, you guys are seeing what's happening with commodity prices. Some of the numbers have to be even more than that if that's what we need to do. What's been great and actually what's been very helpful is when I first got here, when Anthony and I first got here, we took a significant amount of, and you were here from the beginning, a significant amount of pricing. So what's great is we're not playing catch-up. So the pricing is allow -- it doesn't have to be as crazy as people that weren't prepared for it. But no, and sometimes it has to be low double-digits. But we work collaborative with our partners and I will tell you for a super majority of it, the customers totally understand, and we work together to implement it.

George Kelly

Okay, understood. And then just one more question, and then I'll hop back into queue. A couple months ago at your Analyst Day, you offered up some guidance for this fiscal year, this upcoming fiscal year 2026. You talked about double-digit revenue growth and then I think EBITDA margin sort of starting the year in the high single-digit range and exiting in the double-digit range. I was curious if you're still comfortable with those ranges? And is there anything as we move through the year that you'd like to flag with respect to, I don't know, if there's new big customers coming on board that might sort of make the quarterlies uneven or anything else that's worth flagging?

Adam Michaels

So first, respectfully, Mr. George, I don't use the G word. So we did speak about, on the top line, we continue to gain, and we did an amazing job this year. If you put in perspective top line, the deli prepared categories growing in the, let's call it, about 5% range, we grew literally 19.4%. So the team is doing an amazing job gaining share every single quarter. I think every single quarter, sorry, I know, every single quarter since we've been here, we've been gaining share and we will continue to do that. I believe we can grow double-digits consistently. And I think in the nine or just maybe the tenth quarter we've been doing this, we've done that. So that's definitely to your first piece. Profit wise, again, I'll be just a little bit, I'll always have this caveat on if something uber crazy goes on from a commodities perspective, that will be difficult. But I think that from an EBITDA perspective, I think we actually said that the long-term goal is in the teens percentage, but we should be in the double-digits.

George Kelly

Understood. Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Des Lauriers with Craig-Hallum. Please proceed with your question.

Eric Des Lauriers

Great. Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on yet another strong quarter here. So, my first two questions are kind of around commodity pricing and these protein contracts. Certainly, good timing with locking in some fixed pricing here. So, just first on the chicken breast pricing, that's really kind of taken off in recent months and much more so than other aspects of chicken pricing. I'm just wondering if you have any sort of view on what's driving the greater price increases on breast versus other parts of chicken and if you have any views on how that may trend throughout the year? Obviously, a bit of a crystal ball question at the end there but just wondering your views on chicken breast pricing versus chicken pricing in general.

Adam Michaels

Yeah, so I'll say a couple things. So the first thing is, again, beef actually is still a higher commodity than chicken, right? So as people have less funds, they move to a cheaper commodity. And chicken, at least for now, is still there. So that's one element to it. There's competition also. So fast food, I'm sure your body's a temple, but other people know that, I think McDonald's just came out with a Chicken Big Mac, and a lot of the other fast-food places, they're taking a lot of the supply. So obviously we know supply is -- demand is up, that's not good. The third thing is the element that somewhat, I don’t -- this is a smaller piece of it, everyone talks about the avian flu and everything, that certainly hurt eggs. Not enough time now to go into the difference between eggs, actually the egg chickens are different than the broiler chickens. But there is a little bit of that. I think overall, a little bit, it's just, there's just so much talking about it and it is giving the producers some freedom to raise prices possibly somewhat artificially. So we are planning. It is difficult right now. Like you said, and Anthony Morello and team gets all the credit for getting us into a contract that is massive for us that we have locked in more than half our demand. The fact that we're trimming now, that allows us to buy from more places and buy the jumbo, which is more readily available, versus having to buy portion chicken. That also helps us. The fact that, another thing that Chris and his team is doing, the ability to sell both the top and the bottom of the chicken lowers our cost as well because we're using the entire chicken. So, while I always have to go in with the planning of the worst case, which is chicken will continue to go up. I know that this team has done an incredible job to blunt a lot of that. And we're seeing it, our business is holding, for lack of a better word, as chicken prices keep going up. The last thing, and it goes into George's question, we're not bashful this time around. As prices go up, again, this is a widely known numbers, we go to our customers immediately and say, look, this is where we are. We need to raise prices or, very important, or I just can't sell it to you. So I will tell you, hopefully I've been consistent with all of our investors, that we have to make a margin. I do tons of nonprofit work, that is at night. During the day, our job is to make a profit. And if the customers are not able to meet us on pricing, then we're going to have to find customers that do. What's wonderful is that a lot of new sales, you saw some of it in the press release, I could talk to you literally all day about all the new work that Tony and Scott and Chris and team are doing to get us more sales and that actually allows us to be a little picky, right? So I don't love it but the team is doing a great job managing the chicken commodity prices. Is that helpful?

Eric Des Lauriers

Yes, yeah, that's very helpful. Thank you for that. And then just as kind of a follow-on here, so you guys are contracted for now over half of your protein needs. I think there might even be a slight increase from the last time you spoke on that topic. But just in general, I wonder if you can kind of drill down on that a bit more. Should we think of this as 50% plus of your protein purchases every week or month are spot or excuse me, are fixed price and the balance is spot or is it's more like you guys are contracted for the first six months and the last six months [I suppose] (ph) to spot pricing. Just wondering if you can kind of drill down into what exactly being contracted for 50% of your needs means?

Adam Michaels

No, that's great. And you're totally in my head. So first of all, this is all year long. This is a year-long contract. And it's spread out. So every single week we get X palates of chicken. So the good news is this is for the entire year till December 31st. What that means, and actually I just had a conversation with Scott just before this call, what that means is we like to spread out. So you're not allowed or we won't let you as a customer buy $100 today and nothing for the next three weeks and then buy $100 next month. It's all spread out. We get a load every single week, multiple loads every single week. So it allows us a very smooth gross margin profile. I am all about consistency, right? Eric, you hear it from me all the time. I don't want to look like up and down whipsaw. I like slow and steady. I'm going to bore you to death type numbers. And that's what we were able to do with the contract that we put in place.

Eric Des Lauriers

All right. That's very helpful and good to hear as well. Last question from me. So obviously utilizing the breast trimmings is going to be a big driver of your gross margin or at least product margin improvement throughout the year. You've laid out this goal of going from a small minority now to the majority of your chicken being trimmed in-house by mid-year. I'm just wondering if you could kind of step us through that a bit more. Obviously you have these new products that are utilizing the breast trimmings. Maybe just any kind of comments on how those are faring in the market right now and maybe how much, when you look at your total distribution, like how penetrated are you with these new products now and how will that change by mid-year to help get you to that majority of chicken trims in house?

Adam Michaels

Yeah, it's wonderful. So two elements. The first one is, let's be clear from an operations side, we could do all five days, six days immediately. So, from an operations perspective, Skip and Ray and his team have prepared us properly. We have, and actually you saw, Eric, that the trimmers, multiple trimmers. So we're in great shape operationally. The question is, can we actually sell the products? And with Chris coming in and Scott and team, it is actually pretty incredible how fast, at least they're beating my personal expectations on getting items in. So you tried, we had an amazing rotation at Costco last month in the Midwest with our chicken stuffed meatballs. They flew off the shelves. They literally went faster than we expected. Velocities were higher. And there's talk about expanding that. That is pure trimming. That's pure bottoms. We are already shipping right now brand new to Albertsons strips, these roasted strips. It's my new favorite meal. I brought them home for my kids. Barbecue chicken strips, that's all bottoms. We're doing that already. So we just got in and we start actually next month, new fajita items at BJ's, which is the same strips. The trimming, the new MFOs are starting to go out. So, that was too long-winded, I apologize. We're doing an amazing job, beating my personal expectations, but still massively under-penetrated. There's tons of space for these to go to, but it seems every time we bring them, I mentioned to you the new Lidl items. That is using the bottom of the chicken. So there is -- I'll tell you what, not that I did wrong, but last year we didn't tell the sales team to go sell them, right, because we didn't have it all prepared. This year, it was the first thing at our strategy sessions back in November to prepare for the year. This was the year of the chicken bottoms. And Chris is doing an amazing job focusing his team and this is every -- he just keeps knocking them down every time he goes.

Eric Des Lauriers

All righty, that's very -- that’s good to hear and I appreciate you taking my questions. Congrats again on the strong quarter.

Adam Michaels

Thank you. Certainly a team effort.

Operator

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Sherwood with Maxim. Please proceed with your question.

Nicholas Sherwood

Good evening and thank you for taking my questions. My first question relates to the rollout at Walmart locations. It started with two SKUs at 2,000 stores. Is there any increased demand to add more SKUs to that rollout or increase the store count? Can you kind of give us an update on how that's been proceeding?

Adam Michaels

Yeah, thanks, Nicholas. It's been going well, actually. It's actually -- we hear back from Walmart that it's actually a top seller for them in that set, which is wonderful. I mentioned to you earlier the success we're having with the online and the ROAS improvements that we're getting on the marketing efforts that Lauren's doing. We have increased actually from a floor count perspective, but I'm really focused on it. And again, just like all the items, chicken's tough and we got to get the pricing on the items. We're in conversation with them. We continue to do more. They continue to ask for more. I feel good. I feel like, but it's slow and steady. That's the reason why we didn't go into all of them at once. Slow and steady wins the race and that's what we've been doing. But the feedback that we're getting, the data, the internal data that we're getting, great units per store per week. And they're increasing.

Nicholas Sherwood

Understood. And then my next question is related to trade promotions. I noticed that it looked like trade promotion was down quarter-to-quarter and then also year-over-year. Can you talk about how, and I know increasing trade promotion is one of the key growth drivers that you've laid out to us. Are you planning on ramping that up in the first half of this fiscal year? And also how is some of that trade promotion interacting with the pricing that you've taken recently and you're planning to take in the next couple months?

Adam Michaels

I love that. See that? The dollar I gave you to ask that question was perfect. There you go. So I hope, I tell you guys that I say what I'm going to do and I do what I'm going to say. I told you guys we wanted to do more in the trade promotion space, right? We wanted to get up. My operations get closer to 10%. I equally told you when I did not have the margin, we weren't going to do it, right? I got to get to these high 20s numbers. And what you see is absolutely correct. We went down from about 2.6% in Q3 to 2.1% in Q4. And that's just because we just didn't have, I felt good with, the team felt good with the 27%, but I just wanted to be more measured. As we get stronger and drive more gross margin, we can actually invest more in the trade. So it's something that I absolutely want to do. Chris is very passionate about investing. Lauren's passionate about investing in the marketing side of the house. But we can only do that if we have the gross margin to support it.

Nicholas Sherwood

Understood. And then my last question is, in a previous press release you said that a lot of your sourcing, you're not going to be affected by the tariffs for your product sourcing, but yeah, you've talked -- the construction at Farmingdale is done, and now you're moving to expand the East Rutherford facility. Are you seeing tariffs impacting any sort of sourcing of business, I mean building materials or machinery related to that?

Adam Michaels

Yeah, so hopefully I didn't say that there's no impact. I appreciate and hopefully I'm smart enough to know that eventually there'll be secondary and tertiary. Hopefully what I was clear on is from a primary perspective, from a perspective of our biggest supplies are chicken and beef. That is all domestically sourced. Most of our other ingredients are all domestically sourced. But in time, if you knew the answer, please tell me. I don't. I don't know what's going to happen with all the tariffs, but what we're doing, and we have Alberto here to lead our procurement efforts, we're very proactive. We've been speaking about this for many, many months now. We've actually moved stuff around. But what I could tell you is right now, we're not seeing it impact our business. We're very good at multi-sourcing. We're very good at, most of our suppliers are domestic, if not nearly all of our suppliers are domestic. We're holding strong and again, I guess the planning has helped. From an equipment perspective, again, same sort of thing. I just had a conversation with Eric just a few hours ago. We're very proactive. We actually plan for maintenance, preventative maintenance. So we know our top machinery, whatever pieces break through over time, right? Grills, the grill bars have X amount of hours before you have to replace them. The blower motors, the same things. So what we do is we proactively bring in replacement parts in advance, even though we don't need them, to make sure that we have them if needed. So again, that further [warned] (ph) us from any near-end tariff concerns because we have the pieces that we need right now.

Nicholas Sherwood

Awesome. Thank you for providing all that detail, and I'll return to the queue.

Adam Michaels

Thanks, Nicholas.
