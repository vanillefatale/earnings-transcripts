Our first question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho.

Ann Hynes

Can you hear me?

Yes.

I just want to focus on 2025 MLR guidance. Can you just break down the levers of the increase, what is -- what base you're assuming? What's the overall cost trend? How much is driven by IRA changes and what the impact of the greater-than-expected loss of D-SNP MLR, that would be great.

Celeste Mellet

Ann, it's Celeste. Thanks for your question. So to give you some additional color on top of what we included in our prepared remarks. First, I'll give you the drivers of the decreases in the ratio, which are improving the ratio.

First, the majority of the improvement is driven from the MA plan exits, which all had very high benefit ratios. We also made other adjustments to our benefits in our remaining plans, which also improved the ratio. And then finally, the favorable calendar in 2025, given both how the days fall and the extra day in 2024 due to the leap year.

Second, the increases to the ratio, which are a drag. First, business mix changes given Medicaid is growing. Medicaid carries a higher benefit ratio versus MA, as you know. Second, the IRA impact, which increases the benefit ratio given increased revenue with offsetting increases in claims. And third, incremental investments, which are important to the long term, but increase the benefit ratio in the near term.
