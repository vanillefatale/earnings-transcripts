Our first question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho.

Ann Hynes

Can you hear me?

Lisa Stoner

Yes.

Ann Hynes

I just want to focus on 2025 MLR guidance. Can you just break down the levers of the increase, what is -- what base you're assuming? What's the overall cost trend? How much is driven by IRA changes and what the impact of the greater-than-expected loss of D-SNP MLR, that would be great.

Celeste Mellet

Ann, it's Celeste. Thanks for your question. So to give you some additional color on top of what we included in our prepared remarks. First, I'll give you the drivers of the decreases in the ratio, which are improving the ratio.

First, the majority of the improvement is driven from the MA plan exits, which all had very high benefit ratios. We also made other adjustments to our benefits in our remaining plans, which also improved the ratio. And then finally, the favorable calendar in 2025, given both how the days fall and the extra day in 2024 due to the leap year.

Second, the increases to the ratio, which are a drag. First, business mix changes given Medicaid is growing. Medicaid carries a higher benefit ratio versus MA, as you know. Second, the IRA impact, which increases the benefit ratio given increased revenue with offsetting increases in claims. And third, incremental investments, which are important to the long term, but increase the benefit ratio in the near term.

The arrows we provided in our prepared remarks are in order of size. And we gave you the puts and takes, but we'll leave the modeling to you in terms of the impact overall.

Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.

Justin Lake

As you might expect, people are trying to look through -- now that you gave us '25, trying to look through '26 and understand the moving parts there. Maybe you could just -- I assume you're going to give us a lot more at the Investor Day once you have the outcome of the appeal.

But maybe you could just frame for us, if you think about it in two buckets. One, the core business. Last year, you said before the rates came out disappointing, the company could grow $6 to $10 of earnings. Rates seem to be coming in better. Is that a reasonable framework ex the Stars? And then how would you think about Stars relative to that to give us an idea of how 2026 kind of moving parts might shape up?

James Rechtin

Let me just start by acknowledging that we typically do not provide guidance that far out all the way out to 2026. And really, that is driven by several of the factors that you just outlined. There's a bunch of unknowns that we're still navigating. The Stars litigation is a big piece of that. The final funding for MA is a big piece of that. Obviously, the preliminary notice is out. Things can change between the preliminary notice and the final rate notice. And so we'll be waiting to see how that plays out.

What I can tell you is that what we are focused on differentially is how do we drive operating performance. And so what are the things that we can do, fully under our control, to get better at managing the business. When we do that, that leads us to a place where we can get to a sustainable, compelling competitive position in the market and then look at some level, pricing and benefits become easier and they take care of themselves that we're nailing that underlying operating performance.

And so that's really where the orientation is right now on 2026. And when we talk about operating performance, what are we talking about, we're talking about that second and the third lever. It's clinical excellence and all the components that go into it, and it is driving an efficient back office. Those two things more than anything else is really the focus for 2026, but we're not yet ready to provide guidance around that.

Operator

Our next question comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald.

Sarah James

How do you think about the path to 3% margin? Does that assume any sort of Stars improvement needed to get there? How does that balance against what you're doing on cost and pricing? Do you think the book has to shrink further to get there? And then should we think about that as being ratable or back-end loaded?

James Rechtin

Yes. The way to think about Stars -- or I'm sorry, the way to think about the 3% margin is, yes, you would need to have a competitive Stars position. And I'm going to go a little bit back to where I was before. You need to have a reasonably normalized rate environment, and then you need to have optimal operating performance on the levers that I just described on clinical excellence, which again is Stars. It is accurately understanding our patients' needs and doing the follow-up care that goes with that, all of which then positively impacts both quality and medical trend.

And then you need to optimize G&A. You need to be at a competitive place on G&A. When you get those things right, you have the financial capacity to price your benefits competitively in the market and achieve 3%. So Stars is absolutely a part of that. But that's -- those are the operating levers that we are super, super, super focused on because those are what give you the freedom to price the right way in the market.

And look, we feel like we have opportunities in every one of those, and that's -- that is what we're driving right now. Some of those will hit in '26, some of those will hit after '26, but it will be a steady march.

Celeste Mellet

Jim, if I can add to that. One of the things you've talked a lot about in the past, I think, to this audience is we need to get better at multiyear planning, including getting better outlooking around corners and looking ahead. We have to be a lot more proactive in our decision making and planning to be much more flexible to react more quickly, and we need to be better at making trade-offs really creating the capacity, as you called out, for the most important things. We need to be ruthless about stopping things that are not driving better outcomes for our members and better returns for our shareholders. And again, really focusing on creating capacity, to do the things we really want to do and creating the most long-term value.

As part of this, we'll continue to assess how to balance the aspects of our cost structure that are fixed versus variable, and how we evolve to over the longer period of time, become more variable in our cost structure. I really believe there's an opportunity here, which will allow us to absorb change faster and drive more consistent results. Along with Stars, this is one of our top priorities.

Our next question comes from Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research.

Joshua Raskin

You spoke to a few hundred million of investments that are sort of offsetting the underlying earnings growth in 2025. Can you just give some details on like the major buckets of those few hundred million? And then are those going to be ongoing each year? Or are those truly onetime in nature?

And then obviously, the last one, maybe more of a follow-up even on the prior discussion. But should we think of 2025 as a floor EPS number? Or do you need to win the appeal on Stars for that to happen?

Celeste Mellet

Thanks for your question. So just to be clear, we make investments in our business every year. What we've called out and what's included in our guidance are incremental investments of a few hundred million. It's across a set of initiatives designed to improve our operating performance. So we're focused on Stars, of course. We're investing in clinical excellence, membership strategies in other areas, and we'll share more detail as the year progresses as to where this -- the ratios, they hit either the operating cost ratio or the benefit ratio, and we'll leave it at that.

Operator

Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.

A.J. Rice

Good luck Celeste for the new position. Look forward to working together. Let me, maybe, just come back to Stars commentary. Obviously, for '26 paying a year, a lot of riding on the appeal and so forth. But I noticed in your prepared remarks, the way you're describing, and I know this is out there, but we're also trying to just think about the earnings power of the company going forward. There's discussion about '27 payment year, it sounds sort of cautious about that, but then '28 sounds like the year where you think the investments you're making will bear fruit and pay off.

I'm trying to understand the issues around '26 Stars seem to be totally different than what you're highlighting, or quite different than what you're highlighting for '27, and maybe that's some of the underlying way in which Stars calculations are changing. I wonder if you could speak a little more to why there's a little bit of caution on '27 and whether a favorable appeal in '26 makes any difference for '27. And the '28 seems like the year where you really think you'll and these are payment years obviously really be back to normalize Stars rating level?

James Rechtin

Yes. A.J., this is Jim. Let me take this one. First of all, let me just start by saying we are not trying to communicate anything different about '27 than what we communicated back in October. So we are trying to hit the same tone. If anything, I think what we'd say is we feel good about the operating progress that we made in the fourth quarter of the year. So that actually is a positive. We communicated that there would be uncertainty because of threshold movement back in October, and we are simply reiterating that, that still remains the case, right. Like there's just a bunch of uncertainty around the thresholds. And we want to be clear and transparent about that. But that is not different.

The 20 -- so now let me try to tease apart the different pieces here real quick. So 2026, again, not much we can say about the litigation, it's progressing as you would expect. It is unrelated to 2027. So whatever happens in 2026, with the litigation does not impact performance in 2027. In 2027, I'm just going to reiterate it one more time, we feel good about the progress we made operationally in the fourth quarter. I think we told everybody -- I know we told everybody back in October, that the thresholds that came out last year represented a different level of performance than what we had anticipated at the time. We were resetting our targets in the fourth quarter to reflect that, and we were on a sprint. We did sprint. We made a lot of progress. We feel good about the progress. And we don't know what the thresholds are going to look like next year, like it's kind of that plain and simple.

And then as we move into the current measurement year, so think about the activities that we're doing right now in 2025, that influence 2028. We have a whole year of runway now and we have the ability to layer in more buffer or more cushion to our targets. And so we feel better entering the new year with a full year's worth of runway. And that's really what we're trying to convey to everybody.

George, is there anything, I was wordy there, that you can add?

George Renaudin

No, that's okay, Jim. I would just add to that, A.J., that we saw that a lot of the new things we tested in the fourth quarter of last year delivered the results we were looking for. We saw great progress from the outreach we did to our members. We saw great progress of our teams working with our providers through various means to help our providers close gaps in care. And we also have seen great progress in our working with our vendor relationships.

So on every front that we talked about back in October, even before that, when we had our Stars call, we have made significant progress and feel very good about that progress. As Jim said, though, we are taking a very prudent approach to how we think about setting our thresholds and targets in the future and have set them in a way to have them be a significant stretch to our organization to push them to continue to excel. And so that's the reason for some of the caution you're hearing and that we are pushing our teams. We've seen great progress and feel good about where we stand right now.

Our next question comes from Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets.

Ben Hendrix

You discussed in your prepared remarks higher than expected. D-SNP attrition for the year and caution around change in SEP rules. And I was wondering if you could provide some more detail around how you're thinking about the range of outcomes there. And then by extension, how is the attrition you saw in the SEP in that population kind of impacting or informing your MCR guidance range?

George Renaudin

I'll start and then maybe Celeste can add on the benefit ratio. So look, first of all, we are pleased with the outcomes of our AEP given the members we gained versus those we lost. We have seen that our pricing strategy worked and that we are retaining members that are on path to necessary margin recovery and expansion that is critical to the point that Jim made before. We are seeing members that have a shift to higher lifetime value segments in membership.

We're seeing strong performance to date in markets with a strong concentration of our best value-based partners, including states like Florida, Illinois and Texas. We are seeing higher than historical percentage of our non-SNP, our core members, sales coming from member switching from our competitor MA plans. And as Jim mentioned, we're seeing continued shift to our higher-value distribution channels. So all those things feel good in our pricing strategy.

However, as you pointed out, we retained fewer members than we expected in our dual products. There's a lot to be learned there and we are learning from that. We have a number of pilots in the AEP that will help us progress towards our strategies moving forward and helping our D-SNP repricing, as Jim has called out. I would also add that when you think about the dual product, don't disconnect that from the very exciting success we've had in Medicaid RFPs. With the recent wins we've had in Georgia and Texas, that takes us to 13 states and as I think you all are aware, the connection between Medicare and Medicaid is growing stronger and the integration of the rules that are coming out. And so having a larger Medicaid footprint successfully implementing those states will also help us going into the future. So while we've retained fewer members than we expected, we feel good about how we're set up for the future.

Celeste Mellet

Thanks, George. Just to come back to what I had said earlier on the benefit ratios. So the majority of the improvement that the underlying improvement is from plan exits. But if you recall, we deliberately exited unprofitable plans. So additional D-SNP losses helps on the margin, but most of the underlying benefit improvement was something we did very intentionally. And then we also made some adjustments to benefits in our remaining plans. So the improvements are very intentional. Just one thing I wanted to add to George's comments on D-SNP is 30,000 of the D-SNP losses were due to redeterminations. As you know, the way each state did what varies from state to state. So about 30,000 was included in that number.

Operator

Our next question comes from Whit Mayo with Leerink Partners.

Whit Mayo

I may have missed this, but just wanted to get an update on expectations for Part D seasonality this year, given all the changes this year and the higher deductibles that we see in the market. So just any observations would be helpful.

George Renaudin

Whit, it's George. So as we think about our PDP strategy, we are pricing for margin given the additional risk of IRA. And we've taken a very disciplined approach to how we're pricing that given that increased planned liability. As you know, we're participating in the premium stabilization demonstration, and we are expecting to see growth of roughly 200,000 members versus our prior expectation of flat. There are a number of competitive dynamics that are driving that increase, including a number of plans available in '25. Of course, the premium stabilization demonstration has an impact on that. And we've maintained strong relationships with our brokers.

We feel good, though, about the way we've priced the product. While we price for margin, we're taking a measured approach in our assumptions to our guidance, given the IRA changes and given the uncertainty there. We are monitoring throughout the year. The most recent data given that Part D and MAPD does complete more quickly in the drug space. We don't see any problems there at this point. We see that the current data supports our pricing strategy and tactics that we've taken.

Celeste Mellet

Yes. And just to add to that in terms of seasonality, and I'll address the seasonality in our guidance in general since the IRA is the biggest piece of it.

So first, to remind you, our -- we expect 60% to 65% of our earnings in the first quarter, which is a significant shift from last year and prior periods. And there are really 4 key drivers of that.

First, are the IRA changes, which shift more responsibility to the plan but seasonality also changes because members are working through their MOOP earlier in the year and planned liability increases as the year progress -- progresses versus CMS reinsurance kicking in, in the back half of the year like in 2024.

Second is planned benefit design changes, including the addition of deductibles that were made in line with the focus of driving sustainable long-term membership growth. In both the cases of the first and the second, the member bears more expense in the beginning of the year, and we bear more expense in the end of the year, shifting earnings more towards the front of the year.

There are two more drivers, which are less impactful. One, and I called this out earlier, is the change in the number of days and how they fall on the calendar, including the leap year in 2024. And then finally, the timing of when we expect to make the investments we mentioned previously.

Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.

Erin Wright

You touched on this a few times during the call, so I want to circle back in terms of digging into a little bit more. But in light of that CMS push for further integration, across Medicare and Medicaid and to service that D-SNP population by 2030. There are some certain requirements by 2027 as well.

How do you think about your positioning at this point? And kind of in that spirit of being proactive and looking ahead, just how do you think about that in light of your Medicaid strategy? And do any of these efforts, whether it's Stars litigation cost savings, other initiatives detract at all from your efforts on that front?

James Rechtin

Erin, thank you for the question. As we think about the further integration of Medicare and Medicaid, as I said, the impressive win rate that our Medicaid team has had and increasing our footprint is really in line with our plans as we go out as we think towards 2030. As we've talked about before, we have a 5-year plan that we started last year that carries us almost to that same period. And we are progressing very nicely along the trajectory that we expected in winning Medicaid states and increasing that footprint for that future integration.

Do keep in mind, though, that the integration applies only to those states who have moved forward with HIDE and FIDE SNPs. And so when you think about that, that is almost half the states are in that bucket. So just keep that in mind as you're thinking about the Medicaid and Medicare integration rules and how they apply.

One of the things we're paying a lot of attention to as we are selectively choosing which states to participate and what states to submit RFP responses, is we're making sure that we are looking at where our current duals, or not just where our dual SNP members are, but also where duals exist in our core underlining products, you have to look at both. And as we're doing so, we are making sure and we're ensuring that we are prioritizing those states and that we will continue to cover the dual membership that is necessary to protect our margins and depict our growth going forward.

Celeste Mellet

Yes, I just want to come back to your question about creating capacity and the way I think about it, and these are all tied together in terms of our ability to deliver for shareholders, is we need to do better on the clinical side and reduce operating cost to, one, invest in our membership. So we continue to grow profitable long-term membership. Two, invest in Stars and they're not in any particular order. Three, invest in our Medicaid growth, as you probably read in our prepared remarks, there is a J-curve associated with the business. There are -- the initial years, we are -- they are a drag on our earnings. So we need to make sure that we can do that.

And then four, is to invest in growth in CenterWell, which we believe is better for our members. All of these things are better for our members. So we really need to think about are the things we are doing getting us to one of those four things. And they're tied to Jim's levers as well.

Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens.

Scott Fidel

I was hoping to get maybe a little more visibility or insight just into the Medicaid margin trajectory and sort of how that's flowing from '24 into '25. I know that you were expecting Medicaid margins to be at a loss in '24. Just curious, maybe you could give us a little more pinpointing on sort of where that sort of negative pretax margin percentage was in '25?

And then how you're thinking about -- I think in the prepared remarks, you commented on some incremental improvement, but curious on whether you think the business will get to profitability in '25 or still stay in that negative margin area?

And then if I could just sneak a quick follow-up in as well. Just would love an update just on sort of what you saw in the fourth quarter as it relates to specialty Rx trends. I know that's been sort of a key area of pressure. And specifically, just around the oncology drugs, which I know have been a key area of focus. Sort of how you saw that playing out exiting the fourth quarter?

George Renaudin

Scott, so I'll start with the Medicaid and then others can add in. Jim, I think we'll pick up from there. Look, the Medicaid business, given all these wins and the strength of our progress there, Medicaid is emerging as a strong scale business with meaningful earnings potential as we look forward. 2024, as you mentioned, did come in line with our expectations, and we feel good about how we ended 2024. What we're seeing as you think about '25 is we are going to see roughly 175,000, 250,000 member growth in the Medicaid block of business. That's going to come. Split, if you think about it that way, between Virginia, which is a new state that we're implementing in the summer of this year, at least that's when we're expected to, given the state's recent discussions with us. And then we also are expecting an additional allocation of members from Kentucky.

So with that, we do expect some modest improvements in margin. But as we've talked about and as Celeste mentioned the J-curve, currently, 45% of our members in 2025 are in states with less than 3 years of experience. So, there's still maturity to do there, and we are making good progress down that maturation line as you think about our margin recoveries in that line of business.

Our most mature state, Florida is performing the expected margin that we would have for this business. So we have a proof point that not only is it our longest state, but actually, it's our largest membership as well, has matured and is in the place that we expect it to be from a margin standpoint.

The 2025 rates, roughly 75% of our revenue, we now know exactly what those rates will be for 2025. There's an additional 25% that are in what is called the pre-draft state that we do not have total clarity to. So, overall, we're feeling good about where we are. The states have been very collaborative in helping to ensure that rates meet the acuity of the membership and that -- those discussions are ongoing and are progressing well.

James Rechtin

Yes, let me just hit the specialty drugs. This will be quick. The specialty drug spend, it looks very much the way it has looked for the last couple of quarters. It is elevated, it is relatively stable. We're going to talking about specialty drugs. My guess is for a long time in the industry, but we feel like where we have priced and forecasted is the right place given what we're seeing. So yes, elevated, stable and kind of within the range of expectations that we had.

Operator

Our next question comes from Joanna Gajuk with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Joanna Gajuk

Maybe just a couple of follow-ups. One question on the 2025 guidance. Can you give us either a numerical or qualitative, I guess, commentary about specifically the trend outlook for 2025 and how does it compare to what you had experienced in 2024?

And I guess the other piece of this equation waiting order. So, I understand you want to see the final rate update there, but would you assume in your guidance? Do you assume something in that range of preliminary notice? Because I guess, historically, most of the time, final rate is better than proposal, but just kind of what are you assuming in your guidance for those two elements would be helpful.

James Rechtin

Yes. Let me try to tackle both of those real quick. On trends, we're really forecasting expecting kind of normalized trend in 2025, coming off of what was elevated trend in 2024. That's, I think, the kind of easiest and simplest way to describe it. And as of right now, it's obviously very early in the year. We're not seeing anything inconsistent with that. And -- but a lot of data will come in over the course of the next 60, 90 days.

On the rate notice, we're not going to do a lot of commentary on the rate notice at this time outside of the commentary that we submit to CMS. What I will simply note is that, yes, the rate notice can change from the preliminary to the final. That's part of the reason we don't want to spend a lot of time commenting on it. And when we look at the preliminary that is out there, we would say the retrospective portion of that notice reflects what we all saw in the industry over the course of the last year, year-and-a-half, and the forward-looking is still an open question.

There's a forward-looking component that, I think it's a forecast, but I think we would say it probably underestimates what forward-looking trend is likely to be. And so, we are -- that's kind of how we think about it right now, and there's a lot more to let develop over the course of the next few months.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank.

George Hill

You guys have kind of gotten to a lot of the big picture stuff. I think I have a follow-up on Part D, which is, I guess, Jim, early -- given that it's early in the year, are you seeing anything that's kind of changed your margin outlook, or expectation for Part D in 2025?

And then kind of a follow-up is, are you guys doing anything more aggressive to manage the drug benefit in the B space, like trying to shift B drugs to D coverage such that you can do like shift financial responsibility a little bit to the government and to the manufacturers and whether or not you're seeing any success there?

George Renaudin

George, it's George. I'll take this. So the -- as I've mentioned, the early data that we have on our claims for Part D, which do process more quickly, seem to confirm our expectations for utilization that we would have with the pricing. Things look sustained on the specialty side, as Jim mentioned, and on the traditional pharmacy side, things are moving along just as we would have expected. So, again, it's confirming our strategy and our tactics and how we price the product and how we priced our bids for this year. We feel good about where we are.

As far as a B2B strategy, that's not a level of detail that we'll go into, but we continue to look forward to the Part D product within our MAPD, and we're seeing good progress in the PDP realm.

Operator

Our next question comes from Ryan Langston with TD Cowen.

Ryan Langston

You talked about margin pressure on group MA. Maybe just a little bit more detail there on what's specifically driving that? Is that more your strategy, competitor dynamics? And then I guess, how do we think about -- or how do you think about margin improvement in the group versus the slope of where you think you can get to an individual kind of into 2027 and beyond? And then just what is kind of included in guidance for 2025 on group.

George Renaudin

Sure. I'll start, Ryan. The group product, we have roughly 0.5 million members there, slightly over that. In the group MA market, what I would say as opposed to the individual market is somewhat less mature as an industry. There was a period of time, not very long ago that we're still living in where the industry was continuing to evolve and mature and offered rate guarantee contracts for multiple years. Historically, those contracts, or the long-term contracts, were in place. That is beginning to change. We're seeing change in the industry.

We're seeing change in the way plans are responding to RFPs coming from large groups, especially when you think about large jumbo groups. And that's changing, but that will take some time to flow through the financials. We do expect margin improvement in 2026 through pricing actions as those long-term contracts come up for renewal, but we will see some more pressure in 2025 that's built into our guidance for 2025.

Operator

Our last question will come from the line of Andrew Mok with Barclays.

Andrew Mok

Can you share the splits of the incremental Stars investments across the MLR and OpEx line? And secondly, do you have any updates on the Stars mitigation effort for 2026 in the event of an unfavorable lawsuit? I know you've discussed the possibility of cross-walking the group contract, but I don't think you've committed to that plan. So any clear actions that you can point us to on the mitigation front would be helpful.

Celeste Mellet

Andrew, it's Celeste. On the investments, we'll provide more color as the year progresses, both in terms of the -- where in the income statement will flow and the impact to the ratios. But we'll do that as the year progresses, depending on various tests and things like that, they may fall. They may move throughout the course of the year in terms of where they come in.

James Rechtin

Yes. On the group book, I'll hit that real quick. We are still assessing that. So we have not made a decision. That's not a decision that we need to make until really late summer or even early autumn. And so we have time. And depending on how a number of things play out, that could influence the final decision. So once we have gotten there, we'll be clear with folks, but we are not there yet.

Let me just shift to saying thank you to everybody for joining us this morning and for your interest in Humana. I also just want to thank the 65,000 associates that we have who are serving our members and patients every day. When we help our members and our patients get the right care at the right place with the right outcomes, everybody wins. And that is what we are working to do every day, and that is what our 65,000 associates are working to do every day. We appreciate your support, and we hope you have a great day. Thank you.
