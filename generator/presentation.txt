Universal Corporation is off to a strong start for our fiscal year 2025. For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, revenue was $597.1 million, up approximately 15% for both our Tobacco and Ingredient Operations segments, while operating income was $17.2 million, up $6.2 million or 56% compared to the same quarter last fiscal year.

Our revenue increase in the Tobacco Operations segment was driven by higher sales volumes and prices. Coming out of an exceptional fiscal year 2024, we benefited from continued strong demand from our tobacco customers. We believe this demand will continue to support solid results for the segment for fiscal year 2025. Our strategic decisions to accelerate tobacco crop purchasing allowed us to secure our contracted tobacco in certain dynamic markets, which has positioned us well to meet customer demand. As in previous fiscal years, we expect that tobacco shipment timing and related revenue recognition will be more heavily weighted towards the second half of fiscal year 2025.

Our uncommitted tobacco inventory levels at June 30, 2024, remained low at about 13%, and we believe that global leaf tobacco remains in an undersupply position. Looking ahead, we expect that recent elevated green tobacco prices will incentivize farmers to increase planting for the next season, potentially leading to more balanced markets in the coming years. We work closely with our contract farmers to provide guidance and support to promote increased production.

During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, our Ingredients Operations segment also delivered improved performance, primarily based on increased sales volume. New product sales have increased across our ingredients platform, contributing to positive results. These increased sales, combined with general improvement in certain markets and recovery of demand for our core products drove the 15% increase in sales revenue for the segment as compared to the same quarter last fiscal year.

As expected, our debt level remained elevated at June 30, 2024. As our committed tobacco inventory, which represented 87% of total tobacco inventories at June 30, 2024, are processed and delivered to customers, we anticipate working capital to unwind during fiscal year 2025.

Some financial highlights for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Net income for the quarter was $0.1 million or $0.01 per diluted share. Net income increased by $2.2 million and diluted earnings per share increased by $0.09 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Operating income of $17.2 million for the quarter increased by $6.2 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses were up $3.2 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2024, largely on unfavorable foreign currency comparisons.

Some highlights for our operating segments. Operating income for the Tobacco Operations segment increased by $5.6 million to $14.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Tobacco Operations segment operating income was up in the quarter ended June 30, 2024, largely on higher carryover crop shipments as well as higher earnings from our oriental tobacco joint venture.

Operating income for the Ingredients Operations segment was up $4.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Results for the Ingredients Operations segment for the quarter were up primarily due to increased sales volumes, which included higher sales of new products as well as some increases in sales of core products, notably fruit juices. Accelerated purchasing by certain customers and lower inventory write-downs also increased results for the segment in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared to the same period last fiscal year.

Test runs and certifications of the processing lines for our Lancaster, Pennsylvania expansion project are progressing well, and the facility remains on track to become fully operational in the second half of this fiscal year. Along with the expansion project, we continue to focus on our commercial and research and development teams to enhance the capabilities and specialized products, we are able to offer universal ingredients' customers. We continue to expect the project to meaningfully contribute to our Ingredients Operations segment results in fiscal year 2026.

Reducing our environmental impact remains a key business goal for Universal. Setting Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emission targets with the science-based target initiative in 2021 and committing to publicly disclosing our progress towards meeting those targets by 2030 are some of the ways we demonstrate our commitment to sustainability. The credibility of our disclosures is contingent on the accuracy of our emissions data and the methods we use to calculate them. We are pleased to announce that we received independent third-party verification of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions data as well as our Scope 3 emissions data associated with tobacco purchased through our supply chain and the methods we use to calculate our missions. These important milestones reinforce our dedication to the public and transparent disclosure of our progress towards our goals and the importance of sustainability to Universal.

For over 100 years, Universal has successfully managed our business and generated strong cash flows over time under a wide range of market conditions. We continue to leverage our global footprint to alleviate the impact of localized disruptions, such as adverse weather. Our proactive approach to understanding and responding to the changing world in which we operate and our deep understanding of our customers' needs will serve us well as we continue our endeavor to deliver consistent results year-over-year.

At this time, we are available to take your questions.
