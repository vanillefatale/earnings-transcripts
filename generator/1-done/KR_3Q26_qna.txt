Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions] The first question goes to John Heinbockel of Guggenheim.

John Heinbockel
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Ron, can you talk to -- the accelerated storing program, right, maybe talk about that cadence. And then when you think about -- you've got obviously a fairly far-flung network. How do you think about concentrating that? And as part of this -- I know the digital review is different. When you think about the portfolio that you currently have, is there -- are there opportunities or are you looking to -- do you exit some places? Do you double down in others as part of the storing effort?

Ronald Sargent
Chairman of the Board & Interim CEO

Sure. Let me kind of try to answer several of those questions. First of all, we're pretty excited about kind of the new investments in storing because that drives a lot of goodness from the top line and the same-store sales line. And we think we've got a great long runway to grow stores. I think when you think about the things that go into making stores successful, obviously, the right location, the right market. You've got to have great operational infrastructure as well as talent. And obviously, you're not going to open a store unless you think it's going to deliver a terrific return. In the fourth quarter, we're going to complete about -- or in the fourth quarter, we plan to complete about 4 major store projects. We're going to break ground on another 14 stores.

And when you look at 2026, we expect to increase new store builds by 30%. In terms of -- and I guess the other thing I should just mention is how excited we are about our entry into Jacksonville with Harris Teeter. Harris Teeter runs a great business. They already operate in Florida in Amelia Island, which is about 40 miles from Jacksonville. Florida itself is a large state. It's a growing state. We expect to do very well there. I think Jacksonville is the 10th largest city in the United States, and I think it's the largest city in Florida. And I think that's kind of an indication of we're going to continue to expand in adjacent markets.

I think we also have opportunities to grow through acquisition, and we haven't ruled that out despite our last few years with Albertsons. And I think when you look at our long-term aspiration, we expect and plan to be a national retailer. So I'm not sure that answers all your questions. Concentration is important. We'll certainly fill up Jacksonville before we move to adjacent markets. But we think we've got great opportunities to grow stores. And I think, frankly, that's been one of our biggest challenges over the last few years is we haven't allocated enough capital to growing stores because we have allocated a lot of capital in other areas like fulfillment centers.

John Heinbockel
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Great. And maybe just a follow-up, totally unrelated. The CEO search has been one of the longest, right, I think we've seen in a while. I'm curious, you and the Board, what are you looking for, maybe characteristic-wise, capability-wise, and what does the business need from that person?

Ronald Sargent
Chairman of the Board & Interim CEO

Sure. Yes. I think, as you know, we've been pretty deliberate in the process. We've also been very thorough in the process. We're working with an executive search firm, and we have identified and engaged with really several very highly qualified candidates. I think we have announced publicly that our next CEO will be external. And I think we expect them to bring in fresh perspectives to the organization and also to complement the culture that we have today, which is pretty strong at Kroger as well.

In terms of what we're looking for, we want a deep understanding of retail transformation. We want somebody who's very close to the customer. We want somebody who has a demonstrated success operating at scale, who knows how to operate and frankly, cultural fit and alignment with Kroger values is critical as well. And like I said, we're getting closer. We're making good progress, and we expect that decision will be announced in the first quarter.

The next question goes to Ed Kelly of Wells Fargo.

Edward Kelly
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to -- maybe first, Ron, could you just kind of step back and maybe talk about how you're feeling about the current grocery ID trend? It seems like you want that to be better. The competitive environment seems like it may be ticking up a bit. And you did mention some investment in price towards the end of the quarter. How should we think about all of that in the context of maintaining underlying gross margin stability going forward? And I think what you were implying for next year based upon the way you're talking about e-comm is EBIT -- at least maybe some EBIT margin expansion.

Ronald Sargent
Chairman of the Board & Interim CEO

Sure. Yes. Let me just talk a little bit about sales. I think this morning, we announced that sales came in a little lighter than we expected, and that was primarily later in the quarter. And that's due to a combination of factors. We saw increased caution and uncertainty among consumers, particularly in October and November due to the concerns about the government shutdown. Also, the pause in SNAP benefit distributions created some headwinds at the end of the quarter. I think consumers are becoming more selective. They're buying more on promotion. They're reducing the discretionary purchases, things like general merchandise. General merchandise comped negative during the quarter. And also, we had a tougher ID comparison in Q3 from the prior year.

Despite all that, our 2-year stacked identical sales were up 20 basis points, and I think that might have been one of the higher quarters of the year. But I think what we're doing going forward is our focus remains on value and serving customers during a pretty uncertain time. If you look at Q4, well, Q4 to date, we're feeling pretty good about our quarter-to-date sales. We're slightly ahead of our guidance that we provided this morning. But we don't anticipate any meaningful improvement in the consumer environment in Q4. Also, when you do the math, looking at the top line, we're also going to lap harder comparisons in Q4. Last year, we benefited from some weather and maybe we'll have weather again this year. Also, we benefited from egg inflation last year that we won't see this year.

And then finally, and I think David mentioned this one is we'll see some headwinds relating to the Inflation Reduction Act in pharmacy, and that will hit us in January to the tune of about 30 basis points in overall ID sales. You asked about competition. I think the environment remains very competitive as it always is in the retail world. I think especially true today when consumers are looking for great value. Frankly, our focus is just running the Kroger playbook. We want to run great stores. We want to drive e-commerce business. We want to grow alternative profits. We continue to lower prices. We took down another 1,000 items in Q3. And I think we will continue to ramp up promotions during the holidays to drive traffic as well as basket sizes.

The good news is that vendor funding continues to be strong to support our initiatives. Maybe I'll give you one example of that, the Thanksgiving meal bundle that we announced a few weeks ago. We lowered the price this year over last year, and we did not cut the menu to do so. I think the bundle fed 10 people for less than $5 per person. So in answer to your question, yes, the environment remains competitive, and we expect that to continue.

David John Kennerley
Executive VP & CFO

Just a couple of things to build on Ron's comments. I think also important to note that in the quarter, our share trends improved. So despite the impact on sales from the things that Ron talked about, we saw sequential improvement in our share trends, which was good. And then in terms of gross margin, I think Q3 shows that we manage gross margin in a very, very responsible way. And I think despite what we've guided to for Q4, you guys should think about us continuing to do that in a responsible way. If you look at actually the breakdown of gross margin, selling grocery itself actually declined as we invested in pricing, but we were able to offset that with mix on our brands, good sourcing improvements, shrink and other supply chain costs. And I think I'd expect a similar dynamic to what we saw in Q3 going forward.

The next question goes to Michael Montani of Evercore ISI.

Michael Montani
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I guess one thing that I was going to ask about was when you look at the pharmacy drug pricing headwind, should we anticipate that, that annualizes closer to 100 bps for next year? That was part one. And then part 2 is just can you parse out some of the tailwinds you might have to offset when you think about Express Scripts impact? Where is that now? How does that mature? DoorDash and Uber Eats? Just trying to see what there might be there as offsets.

David John Kennerley
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks for the question. David here. So obviously, we're not getting into 2026 guidance today. We'll obviously get into more details on that in our next quarterly earnings. But let me just add a little bit more color on the Inflation Reduction Act impacts that we'll see this quarter and then how you might think about some of the tailwinds that we've got. So I think to provide a little bit more detail. So starting January 1, Medicare will pay 60% to 70% less for the first 10 negotiated drugs. And I think important to stress that this is really only Medicare. Those lower reimbursements will translate into lower sales, i.e., the price at which we sell, and that creates the headwind that we've talked about.

I think also important to note that manufacturers will offer rebates to us to offset that. So this will have no margin impact in the quarter and no earnings impact, and we expect that dynamic to continue on an ongoing basis. As we think about the tailwinds that we have to maintain really good performance in our ID sales, our long-term trends are -- we're seeing units improve in our core business. We've got -- expecting to continue to invest in making sure our price gaps. We've got headroom on Our Brands. We've got, I think, a whole range of different initiatives to keep core momentum in our business moving along strongly to offset some of the impacts from what we're going to see going forward on our pharmacy business.

Operator

The next question goes to Kell Bania of BMO.

Kelly Bania
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Can you just maybe help parse out more specifically the impact of pharmacy on the quarter? It sounds like you're estimating some slight market share improvements, but I think a lot of investors are really just trying to understand what's happening with the core grocery business with inflation and units and market share? Any color you can give there? And then also just going back to the reinvestment of the e-commerce losses. Maybe can you talk about how much you're planning there? How much is planning to go towards price versus store standards and maybe just your assessment of those 2 key factors on where your price positioning is and your store standards? Is this going to be a broad-based investment across many stores, more targeted in certain areas? Any color on how we should think about that and what that might do for next year?

David John Kennerley
Executive VP & CFO

Kelly, let me take that initially, and then I'll turn over to Ron. So I think pharmacy in the quarter, I would think of the impact of pharmacy business similar to what we've been seeing over recent quarters. So I don't think there's a material change in what we've seen from a pharmacy performance this quarter. I think your second question was around units and what we're seeing on the core business. We did see a slight deceleration in our unit trends in Q3. If you sort of dissect where that's coming from, actually discretionary categories were probably the most impacted. We also saw some impacts in our meat business due to the higher inflation that we've been seeing. But I think it's also important to say that actually unit trends improved or held up in a number of areas.

We saw good improvement in the deli. And actually, natural and organic foods held up really, really well. And I think these trends changed given some of the broader dynamics that Ron talked about at the beginning, SNAP and the sort of broader macro consumer environment. In terms of the tailwind that we have next year from our e-commerce business, we haven't yet declared how we're going to split that money up. Obviously, we'll provide more details when we get into 2026 guidance. But as we've said, we expect to use some of the money to reinvest back into pricing to make ourselves even more competitive. We've got a whole range of different opportunities to invest to improve the customer and in-store experience, which we believe will also help improve composite scores. But we're also committed on an ongoing basis, as we've said, to improve the operating margins of the business, and we expect to do that next year as well.

Ronald Sargent
Chairman of the Board & Interim CEO

And David, the only area I would add would be kind of technology. I think we've got some technology spend that is in the pipeline that we want to make sure that we can continue to grow not only our retail business, but also our e-commerce business, which is rapidly evolving.

Operator

The next question goes to Michael Lasser of UBS.

Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Two-part unrelated question. The first is, as you went through your e-commerce review, how did you think about the risk of leaning so heavily on third-party providers to fulfill a core competency, which is to interact with the customer at the point of delivery versus having that key function more in-house? And also, as part of the e-commerce review, you mentioned that it's going to be profitable next year. Is that simply a function of the $400 million of losses going away? Or are there other factors that we should consider to drive that profitability? And just one last unrelated point. As you think about 2026, do you expect the rate of growth for the grocery industry just to be more sluggish overall given this 100 basis point headwind from the pharmacy change along with what could be a headwind from SNAP next year?

Ronald Sargent
Chairman of the Board & Interim CEO

Sure. I'll start, and then I'll turn it over to David. In terms of -- you asked the question about the providers that are going to be doing some more of our delivery. One, we're really excited about the connection. I think each of those partners really brings distinct customer -- serves distinct customer needs as well as occasions. Some are full basket stock-up delivery companies and some are really more about immediate convenience. I think we're looking at these incremental -- as these partners as incremental sales opportunities and customer opportunities. The vast majority of our e-comm sales come from the Kroger website, and we feel like they give us operational flexibility as well as strategic flexibility.

You think about Instacart, which is our largest partner, they deliver broad geographic reach. They've got great scale. They can handle very large basket sizes. They also -- we also can offer agentic shopping capability on Kroger's iOS platform. Uber Eats, that leverages Uber's existing customer base and the Uber app. And I think the benefits here are add-on economics. Customers can order grocery items and do with the restaurant orders. And that certainly appeals to younger customers who want more speed, more convenience. And I think those represent new and younger customers for the company. And then DoorDash, David talked about how successful that launch has been. And there, again, we're focusing on speed. We're focusing on convenience. It is ideal for quick small basket needs. And again, it appeals to younger customers. In terms of the $400 million, I'll ask David to weigh in on that one.

David John Kennerley
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So Michael, the way I think about e-commerce profitability is, I mean, as we've been saying, we're already making good improvements in profitability on the business as it exists today. In fact, in quarter 3, we actually cut the losses that we've been making in half. So we're making really, really good quarter-over-quarter improvements in profitability, and I expect that to continue into next year.

You then take the $400 million that we've talked about, which is from closing the automated fulfillment centers. You then add in the business that we believe is highly incremental from the new third parties that we're working with, so DoorDash and Uber Eats as well as continued growth from our Instacart business. You've got the media business that we expect to continue to grow and importantly, the media sharing opportunities that we have with our new partners. And when you put all that together, that allows us to expect that we will make money in e-commerce next year.

Ronald Sargent
Chairman of the Board & Interim CEO

And Michael, your third question, I'm not sure I'm qualified to speak for the rate of the grocery industry growth rate for 2026. And I certainly don't want to get into any guidance at this point. We'll do that next quarter. But I don't know that there's any reason why there should be this dramatic slowdown in the grocery industry. And certainly not for us.

We've got new store growth coming. We're closing kind of unproductive and low-performing stores. E-commerce has been -- has had a great year and continues to accelerate. It seems like every month more and more. So the mix might change a bit there because e-commerce will grow faster than physical stores. But we've got a lot going on in fresh categories. Our brands continues to grow faster than the house. And then finally, we want to continue to execute very well in our stores and customer service matters. And I'm not sure that I see a slowdown for 2026.

The next question goes to Jacob Aiken-Phillips of Melius Research.

Jacob Aiken-Phillips
Melius Research LLC

So on the last call, you talked about how you're kind of working on how you discuss the retail media business with vendors or across the organization. And today, you highlighted some new opportunities with the 3P partnerships. I'm just curious, like as more missions originate on the partner platforms, how are you structuring the relationships so that you have the right level of first-party data? And should we think of the economics as comparable first party versus third party for retail media?

David John Kennerley
Executive VP & CFO

Jacob, let me take that one. It was a little hard to hear your question. Your line is breaking up, but hopefully, I got the gist of it. So we're seeing good performance from our retail media business today. So in Q3, we saw another quarter of double-digit growth, and we think we've got good plans for Q4 and our plans lead us to believe actually that, that business will accelerate into Q4. And obviously, we'll share more specific guidance as we get into next year.

I think the foundation of this is great tools with best-in-class capabilities for the brands that choose to operate on the platforms. Now as we think about the new partnerships that we've got going forward, the really important thing that was important for us as we structured those relationships is to make sure that we got to participate in the media opportunities that exist and that may originate on their platform rather than our platform. Obviously, I don't want to get into the details of the specifics of how we structured those agreements. But we structured them in a way that we benefit what I would call appropriately from that in a way that's very favorable to our economics.

The next question goes to Seth Sigman of Barclays.

Seth Sigman
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I think there was a comment that you feel good about quarter-to-date. I'm not sure if that implies trends have improved or not. But is there anything more you can share about that and what may be driving that if it is improving? And you mentioned price investments. I'm just curious, is that playing a role? And then a bigger picture question on price investments. You were doing a lot of testing this year. Is there anything else you can share about what is working versus what is not working?

Ronald Sargent
Chairman of the Board & Interim CEO

Yes. I think it's a little early to kind of opine about the fourth quarter. We're just 3 or 4 weeks into the quarter. Just to be clear, I said that quarter-to-date, we are trending ahead of our guidance that we shared with you this morning. In terms of price investments, it's a little hard to know those in real time. We continue to make price investments. We will continue to do that throughout the quarter. I think what we're seeing with our promotional kind of environment out there is that customers are responding to promotion, and we will continue to do that. I don't know, David?

David John Kennerley
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Just sorry, one slight clarification just to make sure the point on Q4 is crystal clear. We're trending quarter-to-date slightly above the midpoint of our Q4 guidance.

So let me take that one. I think there was a second question on there, Seth, about price investments. Listen, we continue to make sure that we offer great value for the consumer. As Ron talked about, a great example was towards the end of the quarter when we knew consumers were struggling given SNAP benefits being withheld. We invested in what we believed was an appropriate way and also a very responsible way with our margins to bring the cost of a Thanksgiving dinner down as well as lower prices through promotions on a number of critical items for households. And I think we'll continue to do that. Value is at the foundation of what we do, and we'll continue to do that in a responsible way.

The next question goes to Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley.

Simeon Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Two questions. The first, e-commerce. Now that you'll be in the green next year, can you talk about the scalability or maybe incremental margins? Does it move quicker or it's still a long evolution? And part 2, since you've been in your role, Ron, there's been some significant change, strategic change, tactical change. Today's call sounded a little more urgent with some pricing, folks coming back to work, et cetera. I don't know if that's a fair read or not. Can you say if it is? And then, I guess, new CEO should be very little interruption as far as execution goes because it sounds like the plans are all being built today.

Ronald Sargent
Chairman of the Board & Interim CEO

Let me ask David to cover the first one, and I'll cover the second.

David John Kennerley
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Let me take the first one. So obviously, the economics of our e-commerce business with the outcome of the strategic review have changed. So we now move from a business that was in the red to a business that's now in the green. We've had a really good growing business now for many quarters. And I think with the new partnerships that we've signed, with the stores that we're building, with the strong growth that we're really seeing across all elements of our e-commerce business, I think what that allows us to do is continue to scale the business in a way that we now make money. So I think as you think about that going forward, I'm not sure we see a dramatic change in the growth rate, but I'd expect us to see continued strong double-digit growth from the e-commerce business going forward with the change being that, that business is now profitable.

Ronald Sargent
Chairman of the Board & Interim CEO

And Simeon, just to get into the second point, I've been here. I think this is my 10th month. And my only objective is to set up the company for future success. We got to do the right things, and we're going to do the right things even if some of the decisions are hard. And you asked about urgency. I'm not sure there's any more urgency. I'm always urgent about everything. And I think going fast needs to be a key element of our culture. I think being willing to make the tough decisions needs to be a key part of our culture. And to the support, we've gotten great support. The Board has been very supportive of those things that we need to do to set the company up for future success.

And frankly, our management team has really embraced the speed, the decisions, the focus on the customer, the focus on kind of moving some of the influence from our corporate office to our divisions where our customers are. And then 5 days a week, it's frankly just a function of the fact that, that's just retail. I mean we need to be here. We need to collaborate. We need to be able to respond quickly. And we need to be able to support our stores that operate 7 days a week as long as our -- as well as our manufacturing facilities and our distribution facilities. So I wouldn't say there's more urgency, but I would say that there's plenty of urgency.

The next question goes to Thomas Palmer of JPMorgan.

Thomas Palmer
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

In the release discussing the fulfillment center closures, there was the mention, right, of the $400 million in savings. Could you maybe get a little bit of a breakdown of where these savings will be seen? I think some of it might be depreciation, some of it other operating costs. And then when we're thinking about the reinvestment, how much of this is investment that you probably would have undertaken anyway, and this just gives you kind of better ammo to fund it versus things that might not have occurred if the closures had not occurred?

David John Kennerley
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Let me take that one. So as you think about the $400 million, you're right that splits across what I would call kind of operating profit, kind of EBITDA, kind of more cash-related items. And then, of course, there's a component of it that relates to depreciation. So it is split across both. In terms of investments, the way I would think about that, obviously, and we'll get more into that in terms of -- when we get into guidance for next year, it's a combination. Clearly, it gives us fuel to be able to make investments that we were likely already going to make, but it also gives us incremental flexibility to invest in things that perhaps we were not going to be able to make. So we'll get into more details on that as we get into 2026 guidance, but hopefully, that gives you sufficient color.

Ronald Sargent
Chairman of the Board & Interim CEO

And just to add, I mean, the key of e-commerce, it's one of our fastest-growing businesses, and that will continue. In fact, it continues to accelerate. It's 11% of our sales. The focus is we got to make money on a business that's growing that fast. And it was all about we've got to get profitable. We got to get profitable fast because that e-commerce is a key part of our future here.

Operator

The next question goes to Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer.

Rupesh Parikh
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

So just going back, I guess, just to CapEx. So going forward, more aggressive store openings, obviously, a change in your e-commerce strategy. Does anything change in terms of how to think about the baseline CapEx spending for the business?

Ronald Sargent
Chairman of the Board & Interim CEO

CapEx?

David John Kennerley
Executive VP & CFO

I don't think anything changes in the immediate term about the CapEx. I think what we're doing is prioritizing the mix differently. So we're reallocating more into our storing program and less into other areas of the business. We think this is good for the ROIC of the company and the returns on our capital as we get good returns from major storing programs. So think of it more as a mix shift.

Operator

The final question goes to Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.

Charles Cerankosky
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

In looking at your store development, well, let me back up a bit. It sounds like you talked about the mid-tier customer pulling back some more in line with the lower income customers. Is that a change that you saw during the quarter? And in looking at store development, anything going on at Fred Meyer that you might want to talk about? And could you perhaps talk about how its larger exposure to general merchandise as you're thinking about that banner?

Ronald Sargent
Chairman of the Board & Interim CEO

Sure. Yes, I can give you some big picture kind of comments about the -- what we're seeing on the consumer side. As you've been reading, consumer sentiment has declined a lot over the last 4 months. And there's a lot of reasons behind that, whether it's a slowing job market or the government shutdown, the SNAP benefits, concern about inflation and categories like beef and coffee and chocolate. I just think customers are managing their budgets carefully. And they're making more trips. They're making smaller trips. The idea of stocking up is declining a bit. And we're seeing this economy where high-income premium shoppers, they continue to spend while lower income customers are pulling back more aggressively.

In terms of that middle bucket, I would guess, again, they're also looking for value. And the best indicator of that is our Q3 was softer in the later parts of the quarter because of the pause in SNAP benefits. So that would be kind of -- I think going forward, I think the consumer is going to remain cautious. I think there's going to be more focus on food items and less on discretionary categories. Does that impact Fred Meyer? I think it probably does from their mix of higher mix of discretionary and GM merchandise. But it's also -- we're seeing in adult beverages, snacks.

I think the good news is that we're seeing this continued shift from restaurant purchases to food at home purchases, which should be good for our business. And then I think the other big trend we're seeing is e-commerce continues to grow a lot faster than physical stores. Fred Meyer, I don't want to point out a specific division, but Fred Meyer continues to perform well. We've got Todd out there, our President, Todd Kammeyer, running it. And I was out there a few months ago, and I'm feeling pretty good about Fred Meyer.

David John Kennerley
Executive VP & CFO

I think maybe just one thing just to add on stores and store formats as to how we think about that. We will continue to build kind of large stores around 123,000 square foot. We've also got a 99,000 square foot format that we're going to continue to build. And I think as we think about the future, we're going to continue to experiment to make sure that we have the right array of store formats to cater to consumers wherever they may be located.

Operator

Thank you. That concludes today's question and answer. I will now hand back to Ron Sargent, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for any closing comments.

Ronald Sargent
Chairman of the Board & Interim CEO

Okay. Well, thanks, everybody. Thanks. We had a lot of great questions today. Before we conclude our earnings call, we'd like to share a few comments with our associates who are listening in. The progress we've made and the strong results we shared today reflect your hard work and your commitment. This year, we focused on running great stores, delivering a strong customer experience and strengthening our core business, really priorities that are essential to our success going forward. Your efforts are creating a strong foundation for Kroger's long-term growth.

We're very proud of what we've accomplished so far, and we're excited for the work ahead. So thanks for everything you do and for your hard work during a really busy holiday season. Thanks, everybody, for joining us on the call this morning. We look forward to speaking with all of you again soon. I hope to see you in our stores, and happy holidays, everybody.
