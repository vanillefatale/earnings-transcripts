Your first question comes from the line of Omar Nokta with Jefferies.

Omar Nokta
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Eli and Xavier, really good commentary, lots, I think, to discuss. I have a few questions. But just maybe first off, just on ZIM and maybe just the broader governance side of things. Can you give a comment on, obviously, the market chatter regarding a management buyout? Is that something still being explored? And related to that, how should we be thinking about the changes to the Board composition you disclosed yesterday? I recognize a lot of this is sensitive, but is there anything you can share?

Eliyahu Glickman
President & CEO

Omar, first, the Board is managed the process of Board member. Two of the Board members decided to resign as such, the Board has chosen two new highly professional Board member that meet the requirement and we have a full scale of 8 Board members in the company. What was the next question? What is the next question, please?

Omar Nokta
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Yes, just in terms of, I guess, the broader management buyout potential, if that's something that's still being explored?

Eliyahu Glickman
President & CEO

For this, we have no comment. Is there going to be comment, for sure, the Board will decide when and how and no comment for this question.

Omar Nokta
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Understood. And then just wanted to ask about the Red Sea. I think you made some very interesting comments on that. And I wanted to ask in terms of how you're viewing the return. I know you're in the early planning stages in the process of that. I guess for ZIM, the Asia-Europe routes have not been really a major focus. Do you see this shifting? Is the Red Sea return or at least what you're evaluating, is this an opportunity for you to grab market share and build a presence that you haven't had before in that leg?

Eliyahu Glickman
President & CEO

The answer is yes. We are actually waiting for the insurance company to approve our return into the Red Sea, Suez Canal, Bab el-Mandeb and we're looking forward to be -- to go for shorter trade than the Cape of Good Hope as fast as we can.

Omar Nokta
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just a final one, and I'll pass it over. Xavier, you were kind of highlighting the ships you've returned this year. We can see the cost coming down as a result of that. Are you able to give any quantification or some expectations on, say, 2026, how you think costs would look relative to what they've averaged this year?

Xavier Destriau
Executive VP & CFO

Look, I think from a vessel fleet profile perspective, depending, of course, as to what 2026 will look like from a rate dynamic perspective, but maybe there are risk in this respect. It is likely that we will return and continue to return vessels that are coming up for renewal and focusing on, at the end of the day, continue to operate the larger ship, the more efficient tonnage, the newer and greener capacity that we have received over the course of the past couple of years.

So today, I think 2025 was clearly a downward trend in terms of operated tonnage. We started the year at around 780,000 TEUs. We say that today, we are at 710,000 TEUs. And we need to acknowledge that the charter market is still to date elevated. So it's expensive to recharter tonnage at a time when the revenue per TEU carried is under pressure. I think for as long as this situation continues, it is more likely than not that we will redeliver the vessels that come up for renewal as opposed to trying to recharter them.

Your next question comes from the line of Marco Limite with Barclays.

Marco Limite
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

My first question is on the dividend. So the implied Q4 for your guidance implies that the income in Q4 will be negative. And given the outlook you are providing, probably we're going to have negative net income for a few quarters at least. So can you just remind us what is your dividend policy? So as long as the net income is negative on a quarterly basis means that you won't pay dividends. So this is, let's say, maybe the last [indiscernible] for a while.

Second question, so on the Red Sea reopening, you've been very helpful on giving your view. But if you want to dig out a little bit more in how much visibility you have got on the timing of the Red Sea, have you got any strong conviction or visibility? I don't know, have you been discussing with authorities or other companies? So yes, what is the kind of visibility you've got there?

And third question is a bit more technical. You haven't changed the upper end of the EBITDA guidance, but you have reduced the upper end of the EBIT guidance. Why is that? And so sorry to sneak another one. But when we think about 2025, clearly, there have been issues with the U.S. ports and the Asian ports, China ports in Q4 probably. So is the China port fee included in your Q4 guidance? And are you able to estimate how much have you got in terms of one-off this year that are not recurring next year from all the issues with the U.S. and Chinese ports?

Eliyahu Glickman
President & CEO

I will begin with the first 2 questions and then we go. Since the IPO, as for the dividend, we distributed about $5.7 billion. The last 2 years, more than $1 billion. And this is about and more than 25x the amount we raised in the IPO in January '25. ZIM dividend policy distributed 30% per quarter from the net profit. And once a year in the end of the year, this coming March, with a catch-up up to 50% of the net profit of the year.

As for your next question about the next quarter, we haven't published results yet. But hopefully, this quarter will be profitable as well. So we have the policy. And I just want to mention here that the Board has the ability or can decide on special dividend as we did 2 times, 2 special dividends. First one on September 2021, $2 per share. And then again, in December 2024.

So the Board has the authority on top of the policy to decide on special dividend. And this is his authority. I cannot speak for the Board. I believe in the end of the next quarter, the Board will take a decision or any time we can decide and take a decision on special dividend.

As for the Red Sea, we according to the announcement of the Houthis and the Egyptian authorities, as I said before, to Omar Nokta, willing to go as fast as we can to change the direction of vessel to go through Bab el-Mandeb and Suez Canal. According to our policy and according to our -- and this is our responsibility. First, we have to have approval by shipowner and the insurance company. And this is what we are going to do. Bottom line, as soon as we can, we'll go through Suez Canal.

Xavier Destriau
Executive VP & CFO

Right. And I will take maybe the last 2 questions, Marco, if you allow me. So you are correct in terms of EBIT guidance. The original guidance range suggested a $1.25 billion difference between the two metrics, EBITDA and EBIT, so $1.25 billion of depreciation and amortization. It was -- there's a little bit of rounding going on here. Now we say $1.3 billion. It was obviously not exactly $1.25 billion to start. It was a little bit more than that. Now we are tilting towards the rounding of $1.3 billion.

A few things explain it. First, the 2 vessels that we acquired in the course of -- in the first half of 2025, having some effect on the amortization in the tail of the year, in the second half of the year. Also some equipment, and we have taken the opportunity of maybe the equipment in terms of boxes, containers are cheap to acquire today, and it's good to take opportunity to continue to renew our fleet and maintain a very efficient fleet of equipment and let go of the older boxes.

And there is also on top of that, a bit of IT cost that got capitalized and find its way in terms of depreciation towards the end. That's the reason, a mix of quite a few small things that add up to rounding to the $1.3 billion as opposed to $1.25 billion.

With respect to your -- the last part of your questions, the -- now that we are in a situation and we've been in a situation since the announcement from both the U.S. administration and the Chinese Ministry of Transport, there is no such thing as extra levy that we are subject to in any jurisdiction when we call in the U.S. or in China.

Eliyahu Glickman
President & CEO

I would like also to take the opportunity because of your question about the dividend. I want to emphasize to the best of my knowledge, I didn't check it solely. There is no company in the history that return in 2 years more than 20x the amount that we raised in the IPO in January 2021. And by today, more than 25x the amount that we raised $204 net in the IPO. So in this, we made an history. Maybe our company raised more money, but there are no other company return such high or distribute such high dividend in such a short time. Please, next question.

Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Dogani with JPMorgan.

Alexia Dogani
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just firstly, on cost savings. In the previous downturn, you looked at kind of resizing the network, taking kind of some more efficiency measures. Is this something that you are currently considering? And what could be the potential scope?

And secondly, can you give us an update on your CapEx commitments in terms of cash, but also new lease inceptions. And based on your comment that you are not looking to renew charters that are expiring, how much of the asset base should we expect will kind of roll off in the next 12 to 18 months?

And then finally, are there any financial leverage parameters that you are keen to work towards even if there is a potential downturn, mindful that most of your debt is kind of lease debt or kind of charter debt?

Xavier Destriau
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Alexia. I'll try to take your questions in the orders that you raised them. First, you were asking on the cost savings and resizing potentially the network. Clearly, the company is always looking at trying to respond with agility to the changing market conditions. What I think is very important, again, to reemphasize, and I think that makes it -- that links with your third question is that the vessels that we are committed to in terms of long-term charter are the most efficient one today that we operate. And so we will keep those ones and the ones that potentially we will let go, again, depending on what the markets look like, will de facto be the ones that are less efficient, older, not LNG powered and more expensive.

So I think this is very important when we think about the capacity that we end up operating, the efficient tonnage is with us for the longer term. And in terms of percentage, maybe to link again with your third question, how much does it mean in terms of asset base or right-of-use assets, as you indeed rightly said. When we look -- I don't have the exact number, but maybe to assist here in trying to get the picture, we in terms of total capacity today out of the 710,000 TEU that we operate, 70% of that capacity, even maybe closer to 75% of that capacity is either long-term chartered or owned, leaving 25% of the amount of our right-of-use asset, give or take, on our balance sheet being the one capacity that can be returned.

In terms of next year, 2026, this is -- we have, again, 200,000 or 190,000 TEUs of capacity that is chartered on what we define short-term charter, out of which I think we said we have something like 80,000 TEUs that could be redelivered in 2026.

So that's the way, I mean, I think to look at the math and come up with the -- with what -- the best assessment of the asset base that could be redelivered.

With respect to your second question, sorry, I did not end up taking them in the order as you raised them. The second question on the cash CapEx, we don't have much commitment in this respect very much because we are chartering as opposed to anything else. So very limited. The cash CapEx that we have is more related to sometimes equipment. But we've been -- as I just mentioned in the prior comment, we've been very active in already renewing our fleet of containers.

So there is limited needs, especially if we do not grow our fleet in the coming years. So I think we are set in this respect with regards to our fleet of equipment, by the way, including the reefers that we operate. So very limited cash CapEx. It's always IT and maybe there will always be some from an equipment perspective, but limited in the years to come.

Alexia Dogani
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And if you allow me to ask a follow-up question on the point about kind of chartered vessels versus owned. You helpfully put the chart around oversupply in the deck. We've clearly noticed that in the past 4 to 5 years, a lot of operators have increased the shared -- sorry, the part of ownership of their vessels compared to charters. How does that kind of impact you think competitive dynamics and discipline in the market? Does it make it easier for people to take capacity out or harder?

Xavier Destriau
Executive VP & CFO

I think it depends on the capacity, and there is not, I think, one straight answer to that question because then I think we need to deep dive into the Vessel segment. So whether we're talking about the large capacity vessel or the smaller one and then also with respect to their age and finally, with respect to their environmental footprint as well. So -- but by and large, I think what we are seeing and what has been, I think, very much motivating the company to shift its strategy after the IPO after 2021, 2022, the COVID era days is that we felt that we could no longer rely on the short-term charter market to source the vessels that we needed.

And hence, we had to go seek that capacity for ourselves. And we went through the avenue of partnering with vessel owners to go to shipyards, order the ships that were the ones that we needed and agree with those vessel owners on a financing solution. At the end of the day, that's one way of looking at it. And I think nowadays, when we look at the order book for the new tonnage that is on order, it is very much carrier orders that we can see or if it is not carriers and non-vessel operators, there is very often already at the time of placing the order a charter attached.

So a pre-agreement between that vessel and non-vessel operator and the potential lessee that will take those vessels on charter. So we feel that we did operate the transition timely in '21, '22, got the vessel in '23, '24. And now we feel much more confident in our ability to continue to operate the right tonnage in the years to come, having less dependency on the short-term charter market.

Your next question comes from the line of Chloe Fu with Citi.

Tianyu Fu
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

My first question is on the route diversification you have mentioned that you're adding to the Southeast Asia and LatAm markets. And I just wanted to ask at the current rate environment, which looks like a sub breakeven overall, which route is more profitable for you at the moment and which is less profitable? And how quickly can you adjust those capacities as you see opportunities appear?

And my second question is that, obviously, you mentioned that you anticipate rate pressure in Q4 in 2026. As we know that the new capacities are coming in, in the next 5 years, where do you see that the rates will recover? And what do you think will be that pivoting moment in your perspective?

Xavier Destriau
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you. The diversification that you are referring to, and it's true that we've been historically and we continue to be very exposed to the Transpacific trade. We are no stranger to the trend that was initiated between the 2 countries, China and the U.S., and we have taken actions already over the past years to increase our footprint in Southeast Asia to capture the cargo that is moving from China to the neighboring country in Southeast Asia, whether those find their way in terms of countries of destination to the U.S. or elsewhere.

And you're right in saying that also outside of this pure Southeast Asia market, we do see and believe that there is growth opportunity on the Latin America trade. Now which one are the most profitable trade? This is a very -- a question that depends on when we ask the question, the volatility of our environment and trade by trade, the dynamic may differ as well. We see positive signs in one trade in a given week or a given period, maybe a couple of weeks, and then we see something else happening and the trend changing.

So it is really much a moving environment, and I don't think we can look at it that way. I think it is also important for us to -- when we build a position in a trade where we may -- we were maybe not such a significant player in the past. We need to do it gradually. We need also to make sure that when we come and open a service, we guarantee to our customers, the reliability that they need. So we need to provide a service that is reliable. Sometimes it means investing a little bit irrespective of what the market dynamic does in order to capitalize on that.

And I think a very good illustration of that is the success that we've had on the Pacific Southwest with our expedite service that we initiated in 2020 -- in June 2020 and which now is highly recognized by the market as a very reliable and successful service. So we need to really look at it as well, I think, from a customer vantage point.

And then to your next question, I think very difficult for me to answer when the rate dynamic will change. Clearly, what we can see today are the threats, which come more specifically with the order book and the capacity that is about to hit the trade with the market, the water. We also talked about the Suez Canal reopening and emphasizing that this comes with opportunities and risk. And the risk is indeed clearly an influx of tonnage that may not be absorbed by the market and as a result, putting additional pressure on the freight rate -- on the rate environment.

But in front of that, at the end of the day, the liners always have capacities to manage. At the end of the day, the capacity that is being deployed to better adapt to the demand and to the changing demand. We are clearly also leveraging the operating together in order to reduce cost at the end of the day. We also will need -- and we need to see at some point, as we mentioned, vessels being retired, aging capacity being taken out of the trade. So that has yet to start. And I think when the situation changes on that front, we should start to see rates stabilize and potentially come back to higher levels.

This concludes our Q&A session today. I will now turn the call back over to Eli Glickman for closing remarks.

Eliyahu Glickman
President & CEO

Thank you. Slide #17. To conclude, despite continued uncertainty in the market, our solid Q3 results reflect the agile nature of our commercial strategy as well as the advantages of our modern upscale fleet of cost-efficient vessels. We remain disciplined and proactive navigating headwinds with resilience and maintaining service reliability for customers while optimizing our cost base. We continue to share our success with investors and declared a dividend of $0.31 per share or a total of $37 million, consistent with our dividend policy and capital allocation priorities.

Looking ahead, the fourth quarter is trending weaker than originally projected. However, based on our strong performance year-to-date, we've increased the midpoint of our 2025 guidance ranges. Overall, we are confident even against the backdrop of highly volatile rate environment that our differentiated strategy and enhanced industry position will drive sustainable growth over the long term. I would like to thank ZIM employees around the globe for their professionalism and dedication as well as our customers and shareholders for their continuous trust and support. We look forward to sharing our continued progress with you all. Thank you very much.

Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.
