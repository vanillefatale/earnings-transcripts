Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Erik Zwick with Lucid Capital Markets.

Erik Zwick
Lucid Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to start first, Chris, in your prepared comments, you mentioned that you saw an increase in M&A activity in the most recent quarter. And I'm curious if maybe you could just provide a little more color there in terms of whether that was fairly broad-based or has it been concentrated in a few industries. And do you expect that to continue into '26 here?

Christian Oberbeck
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I guess we're not really equipped to talk about the entire M&A marketplace. But I think, clearly, just take the large end of some mega, mega deals done last year, and that are fairly new to the market recently. So large M&A has picked up substantially. And then in the world that we're focused on, we're just seeing more deals, more -- more people are getting ready to transact on both sides, sellers and buyers. And I think as Mike mentioned in his remarks, and I'll turn it over to Mike to talk more -- more specifically, I think we're also seeing, even though the M&A is up, we're seeing a lot more competition. So there's just a lot of interest in all these M&A transactions. So we are hopeful that this is the beginning of a -- sort of back to more of a normalization of the level of M&A that we've seen in general that has been missing over the last couple of years. Mike?

Michael Grisius
Co-Managing Partner & Chief Investment Officer

Yes. Let me expound on that. So when we look at the deal flow that we're getting from our relationships that we've had for years, we view that as kind of more of an indicator of the M&A market moving because we're already seeing deal flow from that group. And if their deal flow is picking up, we view that as a good sign and probably reflective of M&A activity growing.

It's a little too early to say with certainty, but certainly, we do see a pickup there, and we're seeing more change of control transactions there and getting involved in more processes, which is great. One of the things that we like so much about being at our end of the market is that, we're not just beholden to the M&A market and having to just kind of wait for the tide to come in, if you will. At the lower end of the middle market, there's just thousands upon thousands of companies. And so if you put effort into getting deep into the various markets throughout the country and getting to know the different deal dealers and investors in these small end of the market, you can drive a lot more deal flow. And that deal flow doesn't necessarily move 1 to 1 with the larger M&A activity. Some of these businesses get -- involved in a change of control transaction because there's somebody is retiring and moving on and deciding to sell their business. It might be baby boomer activity, things of that nature.

And so we're in a position where certainly we're affected by M&A activity, and we are seeing a pickup there. But we also feel like our destinies in our own hands, which you see in the origination activity that we've been successful with. Recently, a lot of that's just based on us, doubling down on our outreach in the marketplace.

Erik Zwick

That's great color. And then moving to Slide 13, where you've outlaid kind of the historical trends for realized gains. It's nice to see over the past 3 quarters, you've returned to your longer-term trend of positive gains there. And I know it's hard to have too much of a forward-looking view there. But anything expected in the near term, either in the current quarter or maybe a quarter out where you might see some more realizations there?

Christian Oberbeck
Chairman, President & CEO

As you can appreciate, we're not in control of that. And so it's hard for us to make a prediction. I mean there are some processes underway in some of our portfolio companies, but how they wind up is not something we're in a position to predict at this moment.

Henri Steenkamp
Chief Compliance Officer, Secretary, Treasurer, CFO & Director

Yes, Erik, I would say just timing is hard to say, but what we are really happy about is that on the noncore -- sorry, our core non-CLO BDC business, our fair value is about 2% above our costs. So that's just from an overall perspective, which obviously we're happy to see.

Erik Zwick
Lucid Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And last one for me. Just thinking about the impact of lower short-term interest rates. You noted that several times during your comments, you've got a slide addressing that. I think that November cut probably has not been fully realized in the portfolio and not the December cut as well, and the futures market is looking at another 50 as well as spreads remaining tight. Henri, you mentioned the opportunity on the liability side to maybe bring out some cost savings there. So just trying to think about the earnings power from kind of the current level that you just reported, is holding the line there, would you consider that success kind of given the headwinds there? Or is the opportunity to put some of that liquidity to work that you've mentioned provides you the opportunity to potentially grow NII dollars over the next few quarters?

Christian Oberbeck
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I think you laid out pretty much a number of our considerations. One thing to add perhaps is capital deployment. I mean we've got a lot of capital that hasn't been deployed yet. We have a growing pipeline. And so I think the mix of all those things you've described, including incremental deployment, those are all the factors that we're looking at and working on them. I think our quarterly progression this year, we think this is very positive and sort of on all fronts. And so we're hopeful that, that will continue. We obviously can't predict it. We do have those headwinds, but we've had those headwinds all year and we're still to continue to make progress.

And we hope to -- again, I think that capital deployment is probably the place to look for. And I think also as the M&A market expands, we're hopeful that maybe the spread compression will go in other direction. I mean there's lots of -- there's AI, there's mega deals. There's all sorts of things happening in the M&A marketplace that hopefully are going to result in. And then maybe the private credit, the bloom is off the rose a little bit.

There's a bad press out there. So maybe the flow of money into it that isn't quite the magnitude that was before. So hopefully, the whole thing settles out to a much more normalized place. I mean we personally -- I think in our opinion, we think spreads are tighter than they should be relative to all the factors out there. And we think that's more of a temporary thing. And so -- as interest rates go down, spreads may widen as they have generally historically. So I think putting all that mix together, we feel are well equipped and well positioned to make the best of the opportunities ahead.

Our next question comes from the line of Casey Alexander with Compass Point Research & Trading.

Casey Alexander
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Mike, this is for you. I probably heard 5 or 6 times during the prepared remarks about tighter spreads on new investments. And I'm interested, what's the trade-off to make sure that you're receiving an adequate risk-adjusted rate of return, right? Are you -- is the spreads allowing you to still capture the covenants? Is that a competitive aspect? Is it being the spread allowing you to capture a new relationship? Or is the spread allowing you to capture a little additional equity on the deal? How do we get comfortable with that you're still earning an adequate risk-adjusted rate of return when spreads get tight like this as they have been?

Michael Grisius
Co-Managing Partner & Chief Investment Officer

Well, I think the way I'd answer that question is that we don't necessarily look at it as a trade-off. The spreads are tightening. And the way we look at every deal is do we feel like the fundamental risks of the investment that we're making are level set. That is, are we getting a return where we feel like it's appropriate from a risk-adjusted standpoint. Do we feel like under almost all reasonable circumstances, we're going to get our capital back and we're going to earn a good return over time. And is that going to be accretive to our shareholders relative to our cost of capital. So we enjoy the benefit of the SBIC license, which gives us very favorable cost of capital. We certainly evaluate which deals fit in the SBIC and price those accordingly. But all the deals that we're doing, we're looking at as being from a standpoint of being accretive to our shareholders, for sure.

I would also point out one of the things that's really nice about being in our end of the market, which you don't see in the middle market so much is we referenced the 7 deals that we closed or have in closing right now, 6 of the 7 of those deals, we have an equity co-investment. And you also heard us reference the return that we've got on some of the exits this quarter, which were about 15%. Most of that delta between the current rate and that ultimate IRR are achieved through the equity co-investments, which is pretty core to our strategy and not something that the middle market or upper middle market enjoys.

Casey Alexander
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Okay. My last question is, it seems like over the last 2 or 3 years that the majority of the new portfolio companies have come from new relationships. And while I understand that you want to broaden the platform, at the same point in time, there's value to the deals that you have from the existing relationships because you tend to know how they act when things get sideways. And so I just want to hear how you're balancing that risk because new relationships sometimes can surprise you when things go wrong, and so I want to get a feel for how you feel about that effort?

Michael Grisius
Co-Managing Partner & Chief Investment Officer

Yes. And that's a very fair question and something that we spend a lot of time thinking about as well. I would remind you that for us, what's so neat about our business model and our investment approach is that most quarters our follow-on activity exceeds our new origination new platform activity. So most of the investments that we're making, we're sort of coming in with a relatively small bite-size, and then we're watching the performance of the asset and then we're supporting their growth over time, and it gives us sort of option value, if you will.

And most of that historically has really been candidly with existing relationships. This progress that we've been making with new relationships is relatively new thing, and it's been a result of a lot of the business development efforts that the whole team has embarked upon, I'll call it, in the last year to 18 months. That -- the gestation period of getting a deal done with a new relationship is quite long. In a lot of ways, we wish it were shorter.

But ultimately, it's quite long, and it's one of the reasons you have some pretty healthy barriers to entry in developing new relationships. But typically, when we're cultivating a new relationship, we have a really good sense of the sponsorship's reputation in the marketplace. We have a really good sense of the portfolio that they've constructed, how it's performed. We have a really good sense of the key team members. We generally have been in the market for a long time. We do a lot of work trying to get comfortable that the ownership group is the right one for the asset that they're investing in and that we're supporting. So it is something that we take a lot of take into account.

And I would tell you, the bar is a bit higher as you correctly pointed out, when you know a group and you know exactly how they behave and what -- where they're really good, and maybe where they don't have as strong an investment perspective, it can make it easier to make investment decisions. When you don't have that history, you've got to do a lot more work, which is something that we have done and we'll continue to do.

Christian Oberbeck
Chairman, President & CEO

The other thing I would add, Casey, is that is the opportunity side of this, which is these are -- these are new relationships for doing a deal. We've been courting these people for a long time. And so in many instances, we've been tracking them. So it's not like they're brand new parties. And if you look at how we grow and our market opportunity across the smaller middle market, each one of these new relationships can all of a sudden lead to, as Mike was describing, a series of investments with follow-ons and sort of a compounding growth effect in terms of the opportunity flow. And relatively, I'm not going to say proprietary because that might be too strong a word, but certainly preferred flow in our direction with us having a lot more control over our participation in the follow-ons and the new deals.

Our next question comes from the line of Heli Sheth with Raymond James.

Heli Sheth
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

So obviously, in the same tune as Erik and Casey, originations and repayments were elevated this quarter, and there seems to be a pickup in the M&A market. Any sort of shift in the mix of the kind of deals you're seeing in the pipeline in terms of sponsor versus nonsponsor, incumbent versus new borrowers or LTVs?

Michael Grisius
Co-Managing Partner & Chief Investment Officer

Really, really good question. Not a significant difference in that respect. We have developed a really strong expertise in SaaS lending. We continue to see, therefore, a lot of deals in that space and think that it's still a rich market for us to lend to and invest in. But I would say that we've also grown our relationships outside of that space, and we are seeing probably more deals outside of the software space than we have historically. So the majority of the deals that we've done or have been closing are non-software deals that are kind of core lower middle-market businesses generally.

Outside of that, I think the flavor is what it typically is, a mix of mostly sponsored deals, but also some deals where they're an independent sponsor or we're backing a management team directly. And that's been a core part of our business as well and has been an area where we've invested very successfully.

Heli Sheth
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Alright. That's helpful. And you mentioned kind of also investing outside SaaS and tech. I know AI has been a concern when it comes to lending. So any ideas of what industries you would say are vulnerable to AI outside of tech?

Michael Grisius
Co-Managing Partner & Chief Investment Officer

That could be a much, much longer answer than I could give on this call. But I would say when we're looking at any business, we're always evaluating it from a perspective of what is it that AI brings to the table. And could AI change the business in a very significant way where it could get disrupted. And if the conclusion is that it's hard to say how the impact is going to be, we're going to steer away from those deals. So it's -- I think the AI development is relatively new, but it's something that we're highly attuned to and evaluating for every single deal that we look at.

I would say there's also some portfolio companies that we have, where they're incorporating AI and they're using it to improve their business in a way that is improving the credit profile of some of our portfolio companies as well. So it's -- it's a double-edged sword, but it's something that we're very much focused on.

Christian Oberbeck
Chairman, President & CEO

And we're definitely staying away from taxi medallions.

Heli Sheth
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Perfect. And then 1 last quick one. Could I get the spillover balance as of the end of the quarter?

Henri Steenkamp
Chief Compliance Officer, Secretary, Treasurer, CFO & Director

Yes. And per share, Heli, it's probably around approximately $2 per share at the moment.

Operator
