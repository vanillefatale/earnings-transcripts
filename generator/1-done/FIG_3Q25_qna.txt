[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.

Keith Weiss
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Excellent. Congratulations on another really impressive quarter and really impressive new functionality, Dylan, for kind of walking us through those demos. It really highlights the incredible stuff that Figma is putting together and really looks really cool as well.

Maybe a question on Weavy and the -- really two questions. One, where it kind of falls in terms of the design paradigm and how it expands your potential user base and how people are using the overall platform, one? And two, perhaps a little bit more strategically, I feel like it implies something of where you think the value accrues in the AI tool chain, like between the design platform that Figma is bringing to the equation and the models themselves.

And it almost kind of doubles down on the viewpoint that more of the value than I think many people appreciate is in the platform. Am I thinking about that correctly when you bring in Weavy and their ability to kind of stitch together the multiple models into one open canvas?

Dylan Field
CEO, President & Chairman

Yes. Thank you, Keith, for the question and the kind words. I appreciate your excitement about Weavy. We couldn't be more excited. It's an amazing team, and we are really excited to bring on to the platform as Figma Weave. When I think about why this team stands out, I mean, they've got with several of their co-founders, 20-plus years of experience in visual effects, animation, creative production.

And when we started to really dig in their shared vision and the culture, I mean, they felt like they're already Figmates. So we're really excited to bring them on board. For those who are not as familiar with Weavy yet, this is a product that allows you to compose AI model outputs with professional editing tools and really take a more modular approach. And the output from those models, I think of it as almost a new medium for Creatives to mold sort of like clay.

To answer your questions, I think that in terms of the design paradigm where it falls into. For us, this is a product that we already have image fills, we bring in video to Figma Design, but also across the platform. We already have like a way to go from Prompt to image, but this is a way to make it so that those results and the content you're using are way higher craft, way more sculpted.

And if we think about it from the Figma Design side, a lot of people on the Weavy platform want to bring in layers and aspects of their designs into Weavy as well. And I think in that case, many of the personas that we serve today, whether it be in product or brand, they will benefit from this. Longer term, I think, yes, it will open up perhaps new personas for us as well, but it's too early to say that right now.

The second question you had about the AI tool chain. I really think of it as this is the next step that's very important for us to make it so that people are able to bring higher craft to the results they have, that they generate through AI models.

And it really fits our thesis that we've held for a decade now, where design is a differentiator, craft is a differentiator, point of view is a differentiator, and that's how you're going to win this design craft point of view. And it's not enough just to hear that first prompt. You got to go all the way to the final destination. And I think we view and Figma Design will help you get there.

Your next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with RBC.

Rishi Jaluria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Wonderful. Great to see continued strength in the business. Maybe I just wanted to double-click a little bit on Figma Make here. Really encouraged with the stats that you shared. Maybe two pieces on that, I'd love to drill into. First, when we think about your $100,000-plus customers that are using Figma Make today, what are the tangible results that you're able to see out of them, whether it's faster time to kind of design and deployment of applications, a greater velocity of innovation, maybe even greater aperture of what's addressable by Figma that wasn't there before?

And then over time, do we see this kind of just continue to go up into the right in terms of a percentage where basically it just becomes such a core part of Figma that all your customers would -- are expected to use Figma Make in some shape or form? Or just how are you thinking about longer-term target in terms of Figma Make adoption and usage within your customer base?

Dylan Field
CEO, President & Chairman

Yes. I'll start off. Thank you for the question, Rishi. In terms of what the aspects of the platform are, I mean, first of all, the AI investments we're making like Figma Make are working, and it's incredible to see the progress the team has made here, and we're only to just speed up further. The quality of Figma Make and sort of the overall experience of it has gotten so much better even over the last month.

And I'm really excited to make that quality continue to improve with these new features that we talked about in the prepared remarks like Make Kits, Design and copying it over from Make to Figma. So really excited for that. We're also seeing a lot of high engagement with customers, new personas for some of those like product managers, user research and all sorts of other design adjacent personas. And they can validate their ideas faster this way.

It's also really differentiated, I think, as part of the broader Figma platform, interoperable with our other products. And I think ultimately, we need to get to the point where Make and Figma Design are really two sides of the same coin. So yes, the results that people are driving, I mean, I think it depends on which -- where they're coming from.

We see, of course, long-tail behavior with Figma Make where more people outside of your traditional B2B structures, individuals sometimes as well as small freelance teams or agencies. And then we also see more of a B2B use case. The B2B use case, I would say, we are most focused on prototyping, making sure your idea works, but we're excited about how far we can go, whereas I think with that longer tail, people are going more straight to production and they're actually shipping.

I'll turn it over to Praveer to follow up with more answers on other part of your question.

Praveer Melwani
CFO & Treasurer

Yes, Rishi, good to hear from you. We're early in our rollout over here. We GA'd Figma Make in our AI products in July -- at late July of this year. And the 30% of our $100,000-plus customers who are using Make on a weekly basis has only continued to grow since the end of Q3. What we get excited about is to where Dylan was going.

As the product gets better, as we continue to ship features, it continues to become a larger and larger part of the sales narrative and the pitch. The platform narrative continues to resonate with folks. Today, about 70% of our customers are using three or more products. And our expectation is as these products get better for us to continue to see improvement in those metrics. Our $1,000 or rather our $10,000 plus customers, our $100,000-plus customers, their growth accelerated quarter-over-quarter in large part due to the new products that we launched. So we get excited about what's to come over here, and we really do believe that we're just at the beginning.

Your next question comes from the line of Arjun Bhatia with William Blair.

Arjun Bhatia
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Perfect. Congrats on a strong quarter here. If I can touch on maybe Buzz and incorporate in Weavy together, like how do you see both of those kind of fitting together? Is there going to be a clear distinction of how you go to market with one versus the other? Or should those be kind of merging over time? And I would love to hear maybe in this conversation, how you're also just targeting that new persona from a go-to-market perspective of the content creator over the sort of app design or dev user?

Dylan Field
CEO, President & Chairman

Absolutely. So what gets us excited about both Buzz and Weavy which are different tools with different expectations is to see the way that brand teams, creative teams are already using Figma and then to make it so that the downstream consumers of their work are able to self-serve more. That's really exciting for Buzz. And there is an aspect of that in Weavy as well.

But Weavy is much more about the production workflow and how do you actually craft a way to utilize various models in a modular way and make it so that you can take their outputs and transform them into an end result. And yes, you can also have a workflow process come out of that, which can be consumed. But I think that Buzz is more of a surface that is particularly focused on the graphics case and keeping consistent -- and I think that there's slightly different dynamics for both. I'll let Praveer follow up.

Praveer Melwani
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. And then in the immediate term over here, we will continue to operate as a stand-alone entity with the team joining as Figma employees and being able to leverage some of the resources that they get access to. We'll continue to sell the product on a stand-alone basis. And in the months ahead, we'll evaluate how we want to integrate the technology and the workflows. And it's good to hear, by the way, Arjun, that you're feeling better this time.

Next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.

Kasthuri Rangan
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Dylan and team, very good results. Good to see the dollars added at a higher level than we have seen before and also good to see the net dollar retention move up very nicely. Dylan, we look at the success that Make seems to be having or is having, how do you think about the halo effect that it's creating upstream in the portfolio?

And how far are we or maybe we're already there where it is starting to have a tangible ripple effect on the uptake of your core product design. And also, if you could touch upon the adoption rates and success, any metrics you could share for dev mode, that would be great. And then one for you, Praveer, the effect of the pricing and packaging on the percentage contribution to the revenue growth rate. Congratulations.

Dylan Field
CEO, President & Chairman

Thank you. I'll start with just a short comment on the ways that workflows are changing, and then I'll pass it to Praveer because I think most of the questions there were more for him. The -- one thing I think is really important in terms of your upstream question is to recognize that the traditionally linear workflow we've seen historically is really starting to change across some of our customer base, especially more of the early adopter types.

And I'm very excited about this because what we're seeing is that people are going from perhaps it's making something in Figma Make, and they go and use that as a source of ideation. They might hop back to the idea stage, they might go to production. You might go into many different aspects of that workflow at various times. And it's really important for us to be able to help them traverse that.

And I think that the power of our platform is that everything is there together. And I think if you look at something like copy design from Make to Figma, you can start to see where we're going here and how Make and Figma Design can be really two sides of the same coin. And the interoperability story and that interop story will really improve over time, it's something that we're heavily investing in. But I'll get to Praveer to answer some of your questions about specifics of how this is happening.

Praveer Melwani
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. No, I appreciate the question, Kash. I mean the way I think about it and the way that it kind of shows up in our customer metrics is you look at both the $10,000, $100,000-plus customers, how those are growing over time, how we've seen the increase in our multiproduct adoption up to 70% of customers using three or more products as of the end of the quarter.

All of that is honestly giving us confidence in being able to raise our outlook and guidance for Q4 and the rest of this year. You raised a couple of questions there, both on Dev Mode as well as our pricing and packaging. So I'll tackle the Dev Mode one first. So we continue to see strong adoption and growth within our Dev seats in particular. We're rapidly innovating there. We've added remote access to our MCP server. We made updates to Code Connect and introduced GitHub Export, which allows you to export Makes into GitHub.

We're continuing to bring design and code closer together. We found -- we've accelerated our conversations with developer leaders and buyers over the last couple of quarters now post the launch of our MCP server. You take a couple of the customers that Dylan spoke about in the prepared remarks, Flipkart, National Australia Bank, both of which who were willing to make bigger swings and investments in the platform as they were growing their Dev Mode usage.

And then lastly, there on the pricing and packaging side, we're about halfway through the rollout, and we're largely tracking in line with our early projections. So no changes to the guidance that we rolled out last quarter. We anticipate that the benefit here is a mid- to high single-digit growth rate driver for the year.

With that said, we expect there also to be a benefit in 2026 as the pricing uplift is applied across the entirety of a first year of a customer's renewal onto the new model, and we do have a large number of those renewals in the back half of this year.

Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.

Aleksandr Zukin
Wolfe Research, LLC

Congrats on an awesome quarter. Maybe just a quick two for me. Dylan, the OpenAI integration and announcements at their Dev Day, maybe any thought on how that has any potential impact to either top of funnel or potential cross-sell or revenue uplift implications for you guys over the next 12 to 18 months from those relationships? And then Praveer, really nice to see the [ balance ] in net dollar retention back up. Any sense for how we should think about it maybe next quarter, over the next few as you guys have some of these multiple tailwinds kind of come to bear?

Dylan Field
CEO, President & Chairman

Yes. Thank you, Alex. I think it's definitely early days with the ChatGPT integration, and we're very excited about this, the ability to get Figma App out there on ChatGPT. But the use case, of course, is very much focused on FigJam right now in diagramming.

We're able to build this and ship it very quickly. And what we can do with it, you can generate diagrams, flow charts, Gantt charts using your context from that chat session and then be able to iterate within ChatGPT a bit through prompting and when you need to for higher fidelity, you can go and pop out into the Figma platform to refine, to collaborate, save it to your account, et cetera. And users are clearly excited about this.

We've heard some really nice remarks. People told us how much time it saves. And we're -- that said, we're still watching. We're learning how it's being used. So nothing to share yet on the monetization front. We're actively discussing that with OpenAI. And overall, I think if you're popping out a bit of -- or zooming out, I believe that integrations in general, not just ChatGPT but across the board are really important to our strategy. We added a lot of new integrations in Q3, and we're really excited about how we can connect with our products.

Praveer Melwani
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Thanks, Alex. I'll take the second part of your question there on NDR trajectory. We're proud of our NDR this quarter, up to 131% for that $10,000-plus cohort, which increased 2 points quarter-over-quarter on an increasingly larger base. The drivers here are -- it's everything under this on. It's -- the platform approach is resonating. There is some benefit there to our pricing and packaging model.

The newer products there that we've continued to roll out with more functionality are now reaching a wider share of audience within those particular customers now as well. The one thing I'd remind you of is the tougher comp that we face versus 2024 when we were rolling out demo for the first time.

But we do feel good to be able to -- we feel confident enough to raise our outlook for the rest of the year due to some of the strength that we've seen both in the adoption of the platform, the adoption of some of our newer products and the performance of our pricing and packaging.

Your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America.

Bradley Sills
BofA Securities, Research Division

Great. I wanted to ask about the strength you're seeing in new paid customers, really solid result there over the last couple of quarters. Any color on where you're seeing the incremental customer coming in here on the paid side? I think in the past, it's been pretty balanced across international and domestic. So I would love to get some color on that and just where you're seeing traction in some of the newer customer additions.

Praveer Melwani
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. No, I appreciate the question there. Candidly, it's a little bit across the board. If you look at the $100,000 plus customer -- sorry, $10,000-plus customers, you look at the $100,000-plus customers, both of those accelerated quarter-over-quarter for us. If you look at our international revenue versus domestic, our international business is growing just slightly faster.

I think over the course of Q3, we actually grew our international revenue about 42%. So we continue to strategically invest in the international markets. We're investing across all of our new product surface areas. We've been able to bring in new folks onto the platform with Figma Make and many of our AI features. And so it really is a tide lifting all boats story over here, Brad.

Bradley Sills
BofA Securities, Research Division

That's great to hear. And I think you made some comments on how sites is doing. I'd love to get some color on how Buzz and Draw these new offerings are -- you're seeing traction there in the installed base.

Praveer Melwani
CFO & Treasurer

So many of the things on Buzz and Draw are continuing to roll out to the customer base. And we're seeing the uptake on Draw as an example there within many of our existing customers as they look to elevate their craft, and we get excited about some of the traction that we see over there.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities.

Michael Turrin
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I have two. I'll just ask upfront. Dylan, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that as some of the vibe coders are slowing, Make is growing. I'd just be curious to tease out more observations around if that's a different type of customer, if that's sequencing or what from your perspective is driving that?

And then Praveer, the 4Q guide looks stronger than we were expecting. It doesn't sound like make or consumption is a meaningful contributing factor there. So just what's driving the Q4 strength and stabilization of growth? Is it some of the renewal dynamics coming through in Q4? Is there anything from Weavy for us to be mindful of? Or just any additional context there as well as useful?

Praveer Melwani
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Why don't I take that part of the question first, and then I'll hand it back over to Dylan to take the first part. So what we've been actually seeing here is strength -- while we've rolled out our AI features to GA while we're not monetizing the consumption side, we have seen benefit in terms of new users that are expanding onto the platform on our full seats and an increase in the number of teams that are actually now sitting on paid accounts.

So that actually -- that strength has been rolled forward into our guide for the rest of the -- into the rest of Q4 here as well. On the Weavy side, both on the revenue and cost side, it's fairly immaterial or it is immaterial for our Q4 guide, but we'll continue to keep you updated there.

Dylan Field
CEO, President & Chairman

Yes. I can follow up on the first part of the question. For Figma Make, we are, I think, more focused than others on the B2B side, where we believe that we'll see not only our platform have advantages, but also lots of strength as we continue to build out from here our road map. And the consumer side, of course, is still interesting, and we do see that behavior too for that long tail.

But what we are most focused on is how do we meet the needs of teams on the platform already and make sure that we are the best solution for them. Okta, I think, was a great example there where we're adopted by the product team and user researchers were able to validate their prototypes early, visualize ideas and be able to put them in front of folks and get that buy-in, but also be part of the conversation.

And I see it as this is very aligned with our strategy of trying to expand the conversation around design of new participants while also allowing a designer to be able to go deeper, level up their craft and raise the ceiling and very excited about where we're seeing both behaviors there on the B2B side.

Our last question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.

Mark Murphy
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I'll add my congrats. So Dylan, we have heard more anecdotes that are showing that people that have tried to use prompt-based design tools outside of the Figma ecosystem, what happens is they end up with a nice-looking user interface, but then it falls apart when they try to take it into production, right, because they don't have the design primitives or the templates or the brand assets.

And so there's a lot of feedback that it becomes a heavy lift for engineering. And I'm just wondering if your customers are developing a clear understanding of some of the limitations of those competing products and maybe making a move to look a little more closely at Figma Make.

Dylan Field
CEO, President & Chairman

Yes. We're seeing not just increased adoption, but increased interest in Figma Make. And I think you recapped that really well. I think it's also important to just note that this has been part of our strategy for a while now to think about Code Connect and the ways to tie Figma Design systems to actual code because like you said, it's really important if you're writing code, if you're building a system, one of the first engineering principles that you learn CS101 is try, don't repeat yourself.

If you already have something existing in the code base, you don't want to rebuild it. And you want to have that consistency and the more you have scale, the more that matters. And that is a big part of what we're trying to drive towards is a better way to use your design systems, but also to use things like MCP to go to your code base and go build it. And so we're very much looking forward to figuring out how we can make that work with the entire platform and make that platform differentiated overall. Thank you.
