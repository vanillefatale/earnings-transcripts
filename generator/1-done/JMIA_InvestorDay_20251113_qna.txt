Question-and-Answer Session

Unknown Analyst

There just seems to be lots of opportunities in lots of countries. So how do you decide which countries go first and how you allocate capital to increasing that coverage?

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

Yes. So first of all, I would say there's not much about capital allocation in this case, right? I mean expansion at country level is happening without much CapEx. When you expand the network within the country, it's funded by 3PLs. We may make some choices in working capital allocation, but it's very minimal. So it's more a question of time and focus, I would say, from the teams. And over the past few years, so we started from a very large footprint. We shrunk it to fewer countries that makes sense. And today, we're definitely allocating more time, attention and more working cap, a bit more freedom to the countries where there's obviously the biggest potential.

And in the last, we'd have Nigeria first, obviously, given the scale of the untapped potential, Kenya, Egypt, Ivory Coast and somehow Ghana that can actually catch up with Ivory Coast because on paper, it's pretty much the same markets. We have a bunch of smaller markets where -- that are either a bit smaller or with slower traction that would be Senegal, which is structurally smaller, Uganda, which is a bit smaller as well. Algeria and Morocco, where we had lower -- I mean, slower traction in the past years. So ballpark, that's the idea, but there's very -- I mean, there's not much around capital allocation in our case.

Unknown Analyst

Okay. So you're not constrained in any way in terms of your ambitions in terms of how quickly you can do things?

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

The only way in which we are constrained by capital would be allocation of working cap at group level, right? We cannot afford to have big swings in working capital. And we know that the most important part for us to -- I mean, the easiest part for us to accelerate fast would be building up inventories, which right now would not be the right thing to do for our business and for our cash flows. So that's somehow constrained. Marketing levels, we can manage with the cash we have. We could do a bit more maybe, but that's the only limitations we have.

And to your point, what I'd like to say, usually, given the type of business we're in and given the profiles of customers we're serving, it's actually good to be under some amount of pressure on the cash side. So we don't get crazy and remain very, very frugal for some time. So we're okay with the current situation.

Unknown Analyst

And just a question on those global brands. Where is the relationship with the global brand managed? Is that managed centrally? Or is that managed at the country level? And how important are you to those brands in terms of exclusivity, that type of thing?

Hisham El Gabry
Group Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. I'll take this one. So first, to come back to the working cap part. If you recall, we showed these 4 buckets of sellers that we work with. The only one where we would need working cap is the part of the global brands. For all the rest, we operate on consignment models, we operate on marketplace models. So it's not cash intensive at all. So we are not limited in accelerating all the other few buckets.

The global brands, we are customized on this. We are mapping what we see from the brands. So take, for example, someone like Starlink, it's a centralized relationship because Starlink is centralized. You take something like Transsion, so itel, Infinix, Xiaomi, they are decentralized on their end, and we map that as well. So we're always mirroring the opportunity so that we have the best flexibility. Typically, with most of those brands, it's a 1P relationship. It's a retail relationship.

And in terms of exclusivity, not as much. We have first entrant opportunity across most of those brands, be it adidas, be it Starlink, et cetera. But I cannot call it an exclusive partnership. It's just a dominant market position.

Unknown Analyst

A couple of questions. So first, maybe explain to everybody the tariff war that's kind of going on globally. How does that impact the business? And we've heard that you mentioned it's actually a tailwind to the business in the past. So if you could explain it to everybody, I think that would be great.

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

Yes. I'll let Hisham answer again. But I mean, high level, it's favorable for us. Definitely for Chinese manufacturers, it's putting Africa back on the map. I mean, not at the top of the list, but at least back on the radar. So it's overall favorable. It's a net positive for our supply. I'll let you elaborate.

Hisham El Gabry
Group Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. So I mean, as Francis put it, simply put, less products going to America, more products are being funneled to Africa, if you put it in very simple terms. Psychologically also, our partners internationally, they feel that, okay, there's a market that is being risked.

So let me derisk and diversify my options somewhere else. And again, the nature of the products are different, but the numbers are big. With some sellers we have, they are shipping 60,000, 70,000, 80,000 units per container, and this is coming every couple of weeks. So significant volumes for many of those sellers that they see as, okay, if we shuffle this to Africa, then this is the upcoming opportunity, and I'm hedging against whatever goes wrong in the states. And the supply is there.

Unknown Analyst

Got it. And then...

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

Just adding to that, in practice, I mean, on the ground, what we see is that our supply pipelines from China are better than ever. I mean we're literally counting the number of consignment orders that are raised by Chinese vendors to our warehouses. This is looking better than ever. We see way too many sellers attending our meetings and our onboarding sessions in Shenzhen. So we have more sellers than chairs available sometimes quite recently actually. So we're really seeing some kind of enthusiasm of sellers having to pilot somehow.

Hisham El Gabry
Group Chief Commercial Officer

And I can add on top that there is a very strong interest even from the authorities on the governance there. So many programs that are sponsored by them. They are putting us on events and so on. They see also holistically the opportunity in Africa, and they are sponsoring that on the ground.

Unknown Analyst

Got it. And then another interesting thing that we saw in the quarter was previously, a lot of the growth have been led by Nigeria, Ivory Coast, but there was a huge acceleration in Ghana, for example. So maybe talk about how some of these -- the smaller countries start to contribute to the overall growth acceleration now going forward.

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

So I think high level, of course, in the past few years, each country had a different pace of restructuring. So very early actually in '22 -- I mean, '23, already Ivory Coast was contributing to most of the growth or maintaining somehow the pace for the whole company. And then we saw that restructuring was pretty fast in countries like Uganda, credits to Vinod, Ghana, credits to Temi here and a few other countries that were able to catch up some pace, but we were unfortunately unable to make up for the whole loss in bigger countries like Egypt and Nigeria.

Now we're at a stage where all the countries pretty much have done the restructuring. It took longer, a bit longer in Nigeria, much longer in Egypt, but we're seeing now very positive trends. So it took more time. The pace was different, but now we have everyone contributing. The case of Ghana is very interesting. It's no longer a small country actually. It's the same scale as Egypt for us now with a much better pace. So they're going to be much bigger very soon. Ghana is an interesting case, and I will let maybe Temi or Renault elaborate on that because we've been able to deliver very strong growth over the past 2 years, actually in Ghana already.

On the back of a horrible macroeconomic environment, Ghana had the highest inflation across all of Africa in 2024, 50%. And still, we delivered 80-plus percent in GMV growth in dollars, a very strong case that by adapting our value proposition to customers with very low income, we can grow in any kind of environment. If you want to add to that, maybe, Temi?

Temidayo Ojo
CEO of Jumia Nigeria

So I'll just add that Ghana is an example of a case where everything that we put out in the playbook is finally working and coming together. So on the supply side, on the logistics side as well as on the operations side. This is a typical example of what you can -- what can happen when everything in the business is working. Also, it's also a testament to the adaptability that we talk about because we have people that are in the market, and we are used to volatility. We understand the kind of volatility that cause. In fact, although 2024 was really a bad year for us, we also had 2022 to learn from, which was also a very, very bad year for Ghana in terms of currency volatility.

So a lot of changes in the way we source in the kind of coverage we take in the way we operate and the way we manage risk came from the learning of 2022, such that we're in a much better position to manage the volatility that came again in 2024. So this is just basically the local teams on the ground adapting and learning from the changes in the markets that they operate in.

Unknown Analyst

Do you have a breakdown, a GMV country breakdown?

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

So what we're providing is the GMV breakdown for the top 5 countries and then the bucket of the remaining 4. You can find it on Page 10 or 11 of the quarterly release issued yesterday.

Unknown Analyst

And just in terms of delivery times from the Chinese merchants, how does that work when an order is placed, Chinese brand, delivery times of the PUDOs you have? Do they have stock on site, you have fulfillment in your warehouses? Or do they do it themselves? How long does it take?

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

So most of the business with our Chinese suppliers is done with fulfillment on site. So basically, our thousands of Chinese vendors will ship container loads to our warehouses in Africa under a consignment model. They will manage transit, customs, everything, and then we sell and we remit the money.

The most simple option for us which means that it can be delivered the next day in the big cities. It can be paid on delivery. It frees us up from a lot of constraints that you would have with cross-border otherwise. On the other hand, it kind of limits the breadth of the assortment, but we're very focused on winning at the top sellers in the 80-20.

Unknown Analyst

Cash flow projections, you have $80 million cash balance and $80 million cash burn. How do you see that evolving next year and '27?

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

Sounds like a CFO question.

Antoine Maillet-Mezeray
Executive VP of Finance & Operations and Member of Management Board

Can you hear me? Can you hear me?

Unknown Analyst

Yes.

Antoine Maillet-Mezeray
Executive VP of Finance & Operations and Member of Management Board

So we believe we have enough cash, as I said, to reach profitability and free cash flow in 2027. It's going to be a combination, as we said, of scale and savings with a bit of increase of monetization, but that's our plan, profitable in 2027 and free cash flow unwound.

Unknown Analyst

Okay. Cash burn is going to decline significantly.

Antoine Maillet-Mezeray
Executive VP of Finance & Operations and Member of Management Board

Cash burn is going to decline, and you have also to think in terms of seasonality of the different quarters.

Unknown Attendee

This is a question from online. Brad Erickson with RBC. When we think about your ability to achieve the long-term targets, can you give us any guardrails around how sensitive the business is to currency volatility before the targets become less achievable?

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

Yes. So the way we're sensitive to currency volatility is mostly -- I mean, it's directly tied to the level of disruption caused by currency volatility. We had very extreme cases over the past few years like in Nigeria or Egypt when there is massive volatility with very strong devaluation in the market, the biggest impact is that the supply kind of freezes for like a whole quarter, and we lose a lot of time building up the marketplace. So that's the big impact.

Of course, it impacts reported currency numbers, makes the figures a bit harder to read, but that's almost a secondary here. It's just that large volatility is impacting our ability to source because suppliers will keep the dollars outside of the country. They will not import, they will not risk it to get a lot of naira in Nigeria, for example. Chinese vendors will lose confidence and stop shipping. So that's what we had in '22, '23, '24 in Nigeria. However, a slow decline in currency rates, I mean, some money is slowly losing against the dollar or slowly gaining against the dollar is totally fine.

As long as the moves are controlled and slow, it's fine because suppliers can still plan, international sellers can still plan ahead, ship without losing confidence. So it's all about the magnitude of the volatility. I think -- and then we have a question in the back.

Unknown Analyst

You've obviously done an excellent job in the Ivory Coast about with creating a very profitable business with pickup centers moving country. Is there anything structural in Nigeria, which is clearly the biggest prize in Africa that would prevent that same model working? Or is this just a simple execution playbook that you need to follow.

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

I deeply believe it's all about -- it's 90%, 99% about execution. There's no structural barrier. To me, you contradict me if needed, but there's no structural barrier that prevents us from delivering the same plan, the same quality of execution in Nigeria. There are some subtleties at country level. The road network is not as great in Nigeria as Ivory Coast, okay, we can deal with that. Some regions in Nigeria have security issues, but our 3PLs, our partners can deal with it. They can deliver in the north.

Supply is a bit more scattered, but we're managing. On the other hand, we have great teams, great seniority, very high level of excitement and motivation in Nigeria. So there's really no reason for Nigeria not to be able to achieve the same levels we see in Ivory Coast.

Temidayo Ojo
CEO of Jumia Nigeria

No, I completely agree with you. It's the same -- the playbook works as well in Nigeria. As I mentioned, those are just -- there are unique in each country, but the fundamentals of the playbook still applies. You just need to adapt, make minor tweaks to adapt to the specific markets that you're in. But still the fundamentals of what we are doing in Ivory Coast in Ghana as well works in Nigeria.

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

Bottom line, it's on us. The one difference between those 2 countries is that Ivory Coast has been executing a decent business plan for the past 8 to 10 years, and Nigeria only had 1.5 years of clean execution. That's the big difference.

Unknown Analyst

Just one more question. So I think one thing that is really great for investors is the profitability target. So you've talked about Q4 2026 and full year 2027. Maybe you could just give everybody your overall just confidence level on hitting that profitability. That's not that far away for the company to really turn profitable, and I think it really changes the game.

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

We're confident. I don't want to go to jail. We're very confident with that. That's why we disclosed the numbers is because it's perfectly achievable.

Antoine Maillet-Mezeray
Executive VP of Finance & Operations and Member of Management Board

Yes.

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

Next question in the back, I think.

Unknown Analyst

You mentioned a significant part of your code is now being written by AI. And I was wondering if you guys are looking at or seizing on any other opportunities for automation, whether it's on the back-end office side or in your logistics operation like the physical warehouse space and easing in levels of automation and planning that can go a long way.

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

So anyone to take call centers?

Antoine Maillet-Mezeray
Executive VP of Finance & Operations and Member of Management Board

We have no robots, and we do not plan to have robots in the warehouse for sure, for many reasons, a matter of price and moisture and some other topics. On AI, I've mentioned the code example because it's the most obvious, but we have developed use cases everywhere. I have my auditors in the room. We are working in gathering information for SOX control with agents, for instance. They will have to audit the code, but we have opportunities to reduce cost and automate really everywhere. The list is very long. As far as the warehouse is concerned, I will let Francis.

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

Yes. In operations, we have very different use cases. In call centers, it's obvious like everywhere on earth, we're replacing human beings with agents and customers are interacting with AI-enabled chatbots. So we have fewer and fewer people in our call centers each year, although the volumes are growing. That's an obvious one. And then in warehouses, well, a few things here.

On the one hand, staff cost is extremely low, extremely low in most of our countries, especially the biggest ones like Nigeria after massive devaluations. And the business case to add robots or any kind of really strong automation just doesn't fly, doesn't work in our countries. And on the other hand, the ecosystem to provide robots automations and maintain them in those countries hardly exist.

So yes, the highest level of automation, we've just recently reached in Nigeria, we've set up a conveyor belt, gravitational, no engine. So that's as far as it gets. It's definitely not an Amazon warehouse if that's what you have in mind. But the economics work. The ecosystem would not work to support something much more sophisticated anyway.

Unknown Analyst

Very helpful. Additionally, the relationship with Axian, they're now a significant shareholder, and you've added Hassan Allam to the Board. And maybe if you can touch on the synergies that they see or you see together and how that relationship benefits going forward.

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

Yes, of course. So we're working with them on synergies. Of course, there are some obvious overlaps in the footprint, so we can work on a few things. Maybe, Marcelle, you want to comment on what you're doing in Senegal?

Marcelle Siayojie

Yes, sure. So -- and Senegal is actually the one country where we have both groups, that is Axian and Jumia. And we're doing a lot with them. We have a lot of synergies starting by selling just the products on Jumia, that's the basic part of it. We're also doing a lot of things. We are working on BNPL, buy now, pay later, phone financing. They already have a solution. So it's working for us. We are also working on overdraft with them, like financing a little bit the SMEs that on Jumia.

So there are a couple of things. Adding to that, we have all the connectivity, the Internet in our warehouse and offices. So we are working on a lot of things right now.

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

The main opportunity would be around the fintech arm what they know how to do consumer finance, vendor finance. So that's -- I mean, we're not ready to disclose anything tangible here, but that's probably the main opportunity.

Unknown Analyst

And lastly, could you touch on why you stopped accepting cash in Kenya and maybe why that's unique to some of your other markets.

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

Because we could -- you want to elaborate?

Vinod Goel
Regional CEO for East Africa

Sorry, what was the question?

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

Why did we stop accepting cash in Kenya?

Vinod Goel
Regional CEO for East Africa

Yes. I think the answer is short is that we could. There is a very high penetration of digital money, mobile money in Kenya. And just a small nudge to the customer that, sorry, we do not accept cash. Actually, we went from probably accepting 15% of cash to 0 cash, and there is no damage. It's actually faster, better for everybody.

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

It's a great example of what's coming with digitization of payments, right? We -- I mean, in Nigeria, 1, 2 years back, it was 90-plus percent banknotes cash. Well, then a few things happened. They withdrew all the bank notes, which helped us. It was a bit rushed. But I mean, the system of local bank transfers on -- bank transfers really works. We've integrated it to our JumiaPay platform. And now it's over 80% of deliveries that are paid through JumiaPay through -- sorry, on bank transfers upon delivery in Nigeria. So removing a lot of cash and a lot of complication for partners and for Jumia. It really depends on the local ecosystems and some countries are way more advanced than others.

Unknown Analyst

One more, sorry, I'm hogging. If you could expand into other product categories or service offerings today, is there anything that you're targeting or looking at bringing into the fold or maybe it's market specific, but just on how you enhance the offering profile?

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

So nothing crazy. We really stick to the basics, right? We have a few core categories. We believe there's still a lot of potential demand to serve in those categories. Then we're still trying to expand. Maybe Renaud, you want to explain the fine-tuning in Ivory Coast, which is our most penetrated market.

Renaud Glenisson

Yes. So in Ivory Coast, we started developing the kids and babies category a couple of years back, predominantly because like we were having customers asking for it, right? Many people and many -- especially mothers asking for diapers in the countryside, while there were no delivery available there with the retail market. So we are covering this category.

And we are also expanding on like -- unlike in the Northern African markets where beauty and fashion is very elaborate in Western countries, we still have a lot of opportunities to grow with local sellers, but also with international brands through China, through Turkey, we are working on several projects as we speak. So we definitely have a lot of growth in these categories.

Unknown Analyst

One more question from me. I remember in the past, there was a big gap between gross GMV and net GMV. With the new delivery strategy, how has that changed?

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

So we haven't disclosed that for a while. I think you can see the 20-F, correct me if I'm wrong. We -- so fairly stable on that KPI. On the one hand, we're making our deliveries a lot more reliable. On the other hand, we're pushing to more remote cities, targeting customers who have less experience of e-commerce and do -- well, we're finding more surprises with them. So many different factors at play here.

The ratio is overall stable on the e-commerce business. But I mean, what I can say most precisely though, is that this is probably our biggest battle in operations. We know that there's a gap because we're doing payments and delivery, whether it's cash or digital, there's a gap between -- a significant gap between gross and net more than just the returns because customers are not committed and the money may be gone between the moment you order and 3 days later when you get your product, right? So we're working really hard on that.

A few different topics here. We're working to deliver a bit faster as long as it makes sense for our unit costs. We're working to make our partners more professional to provide them incentives or penalties if they can reach certain targets on that. We're working also really hard on kind of communications we're sending to customers through text messages, through WhatsApp, through push notifications.

So it's a very broad range of topics we're trying to cover to gradually improve that metric. That will always be kind of under pressure because payment and delivery is going to stay and is going to be a very important part of the playbook for a long time.

Question for Francis, I think now.

Unknown Analyst

Could I maybe ask the same question that was asked around the playbook working in Nigeria, but for Egypt? I mean, it seems a tougher market around. I appreciate you're maybe further behind in terms of aligning the business model to the changes that you've done elsewhere. But I guess as you think of that market 5, 10 years out, is there any reason to think it could just be more structurally difficult there because of competition or anything else?

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

Maybe, Hisham, do you want to explain the specificities of the Egyptian market?

Hisham El Gabry
Group Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. So at face value, it is a more difficult market, okay? So you have big players like Amazon or noon, you have a lot of homegrown players, I mean 60 of them, and you have like sometimes per category 7 or 8 players. So it's a market that is more competitive, and that means maybe your marketing cost per order will be higher there. But is there a structural reason for it to fail versus the other markets? No. Simply put, what we mentioned at the start of the presentation, people are coming with a global playbook. It's more focused on the Tier 1 cities. It's more focused on the higher AOV, which is usually what you come with the noncustomized version as we call it.

In Egypt, we have a huge opportunity in the upcountry, which is still not unlocked in the North, in the Delta or in the South. And this is -- it's the same playbook. We're expanding one by one. We're opening pickup stations, and we're delivering to those underserved customers with products in that price reach. So yes, there is more competition. We're not going to deny that, but the playbook is going to work. It's just not going to be in the Tier 1 cities. It's going to be in the up country, which is our strength.

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

I'm absolutely convinced that the gap in penetration that you see today in Egypt versus other markets is purely -- I mean, it's not due to competition. Competition has been a convenient excuse for a long time. It's, of course, a bit more competitive, but most of the gap is driven by legacy and by quality of execution over a whole decade. And that's why we have like 3 full years of restructuring in Egypt. And now after rebuilding the teams, changing the logistics, rebuilding the supply base, we -- I mean and delivering the same quality of execution that we're delivering in I don't know, Uganda, Ghana, Nigeria, we're able to grow again quite significantly, as you could see last quarter.

So we deeply believe in this market. It's starting from a more challenging point. It's always harder when you're small in the big ponds when you're in the marketplace. But we believe that scale will help. And there's clearly a market for the lower middle class of Egypt that is not the focus of other big players where we know how to serve. We've learned a lot for this segment of customers, and it definitely applies to Egypt.

Unknown Analyst

Thank you very much for the detailed presentation. Just if we look at the GMV or order mix now in terms of countries, do you largely expect that to remain the same if we think about that $2.5 billion -- I think $2.5 billion to $3 billion GMV figure where would the majority of that growth come from? Or will it be quite broad-based?

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

For sure, the mix will change, right? You saw the penetration levels across countries. We do expect much faster growth from the most underpenetrated countries where we're already seeing momentum, right? Nigeria is growing faster than the average, is growing faster than the average, Kenya as well. So we do expect those countries to take a larger share of the mix. That would be surprising if Ivory Coast remain the biggest country at Jumia in 1 or 2 years. That would not make sense.

Unknown Analyst

Yes. I guess the -- I mean, the experience from Africa is that all the countries don't operate the same way all of the time, such that some of those -- like one of the countries might be susceptible to increased risks, whether it be competition in Egypt or otherwise. So you see like an element of offset that would -- you'd see better growth in a more advanced market like Ivory Coast because there's a bit like people can afford to transact on the marketplace and maybe the business environment is a bit more stable.

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

Well, I mean, our forecasts are kind of all things being equal, right? We cannot foresee political events, macroeconomic events and so on. Based on what we see on the ground, we expect those countries with low penetration to catch up very clearly. And then no, I mean, of course, it's harder to operate in some countries for some specific reasons like Nigeria, but we also have lower competition. So there's no specific reason for a country not to be able to reach penetration ratios that we're seeing in other better countries.

Unknown Analyst

Okay. And final question is just on take rates. I think you said 200 to 250 basis point improvement over the 5 years. And you went into some detail about how that would take place. But could you just reexplain that like how much would come from advertising, increasing contribution to GMV and how much would be from terms with your merchants like putting through price to merchants?

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

Yes. So yes, the range is around 2.5 points in the next 5 years. The way we see it happening. So on advertising revenue, we're generating about 1% of our GMV in revenue from advertising. What we -- when we look around, we believe the right benchmark should be around 2% and it will take a few years to get there. I mean we're working -- we'll have better tools, better execution. Scale will help. More competition on the marketplace will definitely help.

It will take time, but we assume up to 1 point can come from advertising. And then the rest, which would be 1.5 up to 2 points will come from better take rates from the marketplace and from 1P vendors -- 1P suppliers, which we're fairly confident with, right? I mean we -- on a yearly basis, we're reviewing the terms. We're reviewing most importantly, the commission rates, and we're doing this in all the countries where we have scaled. We deeply believe that the take rate is a function of scale in those countries.

The more you sell for your vendors, the more you can get from them. That's the balance of power in any marketplace on earth, right? So we've done that in January '25 in all the countries where we had been scaling over the previous years. So that was Kenya, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Uganda, Ghana not so much and Nigeria not so much. We had spared Egypt at the time because they were in a more challenging situation. And in January '26, we will be reviewing the terms again with a view to winning a few -- I mean, a few decimal points of take rates as part of the greater plan to get this 1.5.

Unknown Analyst

And you mentioned 1P. Does that -- I thought that 1P would sort of normally translate into just the whole thing into revenue, but you said there's an element of 1P involved in there as well.

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

1P is about scaling and getting better terms when you purchase. It's much harder to decide upfront, but we also see it as a function of scale for the future. wanted to add to that?

Hisham El Gabry
Group Chief Commercial Officer

I think you covered all the key points.

Unknown Attendee

This question is from Tracy Kivunyu with Standard Bank. How many JForce agents do you have at the moment? And any data on how much GMV they provide?

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

I don't think we've disclosed recent numbers, dozens of thousands of active JForce vendors, but we've not provided the latest figures, and we have not provided the share of the mix. I mean what we usually say it's above 10% of the GMV. It depends on the countries, can be between 10% and 15% across countries with some specificities. And it just shows how significant it is, how important it is to have sales channels that can deal with customers who are fully offline. So it's significant share of the sales.

Unknown Attendee

And one more question. This is from Brad Erickson, RBC. You mentioned some sensitivity to working capital intensity on inventory. But ultimately, what are the gating factors to building supply? And would that carry a relatively one-to-one relationship in translating order and GMV growth?

Francis Dufay
CEO & Member of Management Board

I'm not sure I get it. Can you...

Unknown Attendee

Yes, sure. So just basically what is asking what is the working capital intensity on inventory? And what are the issues that will stop the building and supply?

Hisham El Gabry
Group Chief Commercial Officer

So again, let me reiterate on what I said a few minutes ago. It's only one angle of building our supply out of 4. And it's not the major one. As I clearly said, the majority lies with our local sellers who are all on marketplace, many of them on consignment and our international sellers who are also on consignment. The cash heavy part is we're not at liberty to disclose numbers, but it's not the majority at all of what we do.

It's selected bets. We don't -- are there opportunities that we can do more? Obviously, yes. But is that going to be streaming? Is that where we're going to put the majority of our focus? No, it's not. We're scaling with noncash-intensive avenues.

All right. With that, I think we're done with the Q&A. We have a small cocktail upstairs. Is that right? So you're all welcome upstairs for a few drinks. For all of you if you have a of time, we'll be very happy to have a chat. And I'll be very happy if you can spend some time talking with the team. I've been doing a lot of talking over the past few months with investors. I'm happy to leave the floor and let you double check everything I've said.
