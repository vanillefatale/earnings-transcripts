[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjit Singh with the company Morgan Stanley.

Sanjit Singh
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I had one for Brian and one for Sridhar. Brian, first for you, when we look at the growth rates on product revenue this quarter, really attractive at 29%. It was just about 3% beat slightly below 3% beat versus the midpoint of guidance. But at the same time, when I look at your Q4 guide, it's probably the best sequential guide I've seen from the company in a couple of years. So I was wondering if you could help us square that.

And then for Sridhar, like really impressive in terms of getting to that $100 million AI revenue run rate. You mentioned on the press release that Snowflake Intelligence is one of the fastest adopting products. I was wondering if you could give us a color on the types of customers that are taking on your AI products, some of the use cases that Snowflake Intelligence is unlocking. And also if you could comment on kind of Cortex AI adoption.

Brian Robins
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Sanjit. I'll answer the first part of the question on the financials. We're happy with the performance this quarter. We delivered 29% year-over-year revenue growth. The quarter pretty much played out as expected. There was really only one surprise in the quarter, and that was the hyperscaler outage, which impacted our revenue approximately $1 million to $2 million within the quarter.

I think it's really important with the consumption model that not to view quarterly beats as the best signal of the fundamentals within the business. The quarter, as you mentioned, we raised our fiscal year guidance by $51 million or $4.446 billion, and the FY guide is really the most meaningful signal. And I think the guide really reflects the underlying behavior that we see in our customer base going into the fourth quarter. Sridhar, over to you.

Sridhar Ramaswamy
CEO & Director

Yes. Snowflake Intelligence amplifies the investments that our customers have made in putting high-quality data into Snowflake. To take our own example, we created a data agent on all of the sales information that matters for my sales team, whether it is consumption information or the Workday hierarchy itself of who is managing whom, information about customers, their use cases, and it's been a magical unlock for several thousand people because things that they needed to painfully find dashboards for, they can have answered immediately.

Plus, you also get the benefit that unlike a dashboard, which is a 2D representation of a pretty complex space, you can ask questions that cut across any dimension, analyzed data in ways that previously were simply not possible before. And so we have a slew of customers, whether it is the USA Bobsled team or Fanatics or folks like ServiceNow or TS Imagine that are using this to create data agents specialized for some areas. So anyone that is working in a particular function, for example, has all of the data that is relevant to them available from a single interface and right on their phone or laptop computer.

It is that unlock of access to this data that is driving adoption. What I can tell you is like I -- whenever I have dinners with CIOs or with CEOs, and we are talking about them often, they turn out to be Snowflake customers and they end up showing off Snowflake Intelligence on my phone, usually to show them information that I -- we have about their companies, like how much they're spending, what use cases they have deployed.

And the first thing that comes from them is they want this for their own business. That's the attraction of Snowflake Intelligence, which is it puts all of the data that matters to you right at your fingertips. And unlike before, this data is not confined to analysts. This is to every single business user within a company, and that's the big unlock for all.

The next question comes from Kirk Materne with the company Evercore ISI.

S. Kirk Materne
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Sridhar, I was wondering if you could just talk about the go-to-market. You guys mentioned you had a really nice quarter. And I was particularly interested in the 600 new customer wins. And I realize you all land small and then grow with your customers. But, with AI coming on in Snowflake Intelligence, are you landing with more products now, meaning is it still landing with the core data warehouse and then expanding? Or are you all able to land with multiple products at once and then grow from there? I'm just kind of curious about whether your surface area is growing within some of these new customers.

Sridhar Ramaswamy
CEO & Director

Kirk, thanks for the question. Well, I think things like Snowflake Intelligence now play a key role in making the power of data come alive every single time you're pitching a new logo. One of the magic of recent advances in AI is our ability to do demos or POCs, proof of concepts, that are hyper customized for each customer.

Often, we will generate a synthetic data set that say we will mimic an oil producer or a pharmaceutical company and show them the art of the possible. Previously when people got onto Snowflake, it was for an abstract need. It was to make data more efficiently accessible so that you could do more analytics.

Now we do the work to show them what is possible with a product like Snowflake Intelligence on top of their data. It just makes the value of the transition from previous systems on to Snowflake even more clear, and those are some of the stats that we've been sharing with you, which is AI having a helping hand. It's not the dominant thing but definitely having a helping hand in more than -- in close to 50% of the new logos that we acquired. I would say definitely opens up our aperture.

On the other hand, I would add that products that are lower down the stack, products like OpenFlow are taking off because they actually help make the other side of the data life cycle more efficient. I've used OpenFlow. It's pretty magical to be able to sink data, whether it's from an Oracle OLTP system or from Google Drive onto Snowflake, I think shrewd investments like that are also helping us substantially in just accelerating what people do with us.

Previously, we used to be just the analytics provider, but we can be there from soup to nuts with products starting with OpenFlow, but then things like Snowpark, obviously, our analytics engine, then ML and then AI. It's where this breadth of offering and the complete data offering will end up playing a larger and larger role.

Our next question comes from Brent Thill with the company Jefferies.

Brent Thill
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Sridhar, good to hear the news on AI bookings influenced. I guess many are now turning to the go-lives. And when do you expect this batch of go-lives to go up that then helps re-influence the even more excitement on the platform? How do you think about the trajectory. Does that have a bigger ramification in the back half of '26 then as those deals go live?

Sridhar Ramaswamy
CEO & Director

Well, you're seeing it live, right? We gave guidance for Q4. It's a pretty hefty beat and raise. And that is driven by what we see in consumption trends. As you know, we tend to be pretty disciplined about how we forecast and guide. These are based on machine learning models, unsurprisingly, that predicts the future. And we are disciplined in following that.

On the other hand, we track the other side, which is how many use cases are we winning? What is the time duration from a win over to a technical implementation over to a go-live and accelerating go-lives will continue to be a priority. And we're using AI pretty heavily in making some of these use cases go live a whole lot faster as well. And all of these feeds into the forecast and guides and the general optimism that we convey to you.

Brent Thill
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. And if I can just for Brian, on Anthropic, the $200 million partnership, great to see. Is that in backlog? Or what goes into backlog from that relationship?

Brian Robins
Chief Financial Officer

The $200 million is a buy side that we're buying from Anthropic.

Sridhar Ramaswamy
CEO & Director

And in some ways, obviously, our confidence in being -- in having AI drive more and more of our revenue, it is a commitment. But as you see the front side of things like the AI consumption revenue ARR that we announced, the $100 million ARR, that's what gives us confidence that partnerships with Anthropic, which include a buy, but also a broader go-to-market motion will continue to accelerate the overall business.

The next question comes from Brad Zelnick with the company Deutsche Bank.

Daniel Knauff
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

This is Dan on for Brad. Just wanted to ask maybe Sridhar to start. Just if you can kind of help frame the impact that migrations had to product revenue this quarter versus last quarter? I know there were some kind of unique circumstance last quarter where some positive things came together to drive a pretty strong result. But just in general, I think across all of the cloud names, we've seen pretty strong momentum this year. And just as you look at kind of the visibility and pacing here that you have into that maybe just the sustainability of what you're seeing on that side?

And then maybe one for Brian, just on operating margins. I think 4Q operating margin was guided maybe a couple of points below where you guided 3Q and maybe a little down from what was implied in the guide last quarter. Anything just to unpack on op margins into Q4 for us to think about as we build our models.

Sridhar Ramaswamy
CEO & Director

I'll start. We are super early with migrations. I think you folks heard Matt Garman say today that he thinks maybe like we are 15% to 20% of the way through kind of on-prem legacy migrations. And that's positive news for Snowflake. And I see AI, I see products like Snowflake Intelligence exert both a powerful tool because the data that's in Snowflake just became more valuable because it can be used to drive business a whole lot more effectively, but I also see AI play a big role in pushing migrations forward, in other words, making the act of migrating from legacy systems go faster.

And this is where tuck-in acquisitions like the acquisition of Datometry, which makes products that make migrations go faster, easier are also helpful. We keep a close watch on migrations through the entirety of the use case life cycle, and it's something that we are continuously looking to accelerate, bring better techniques. It's an area that I've been personally involved with throughout the year, and we continue to make very solid progress.

Brian Robins
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Just real quickly on the 4Q guidance. All I would say is that 4Q is a little tricky in the sense that you're giving the 4Q guidance and the annual guidance at the same time. And so don't read too much into that. There's nothing intended by meant to read into that.

Operator

Next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with the company Barclays.

Raimo Lenschow
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

One question to stick to that one question rule. Sridhar, zero-copy comes up a lot in the conversation. And like every vendor is now talking about like, "oh, we're doing zero-copy that helps to kind of -- help us play better with everyone else in the ecosystem, et cetera." How do you think that will impact you? Is it kind of -- does it drive more adoption? Does it impact how much you can monetize? Can you speak to that, please?

Sridhar Ramaswamy
CEO & Director

Yes. Zero-copy generally comes up in the context of SaaS vendors who are under a lot of pressure from their customers to share data. Many of them are busy creating data products on top of the data as a way to monetize, and zero-copy or sometimes bidirectional data sharing agreements come up in that context as a faster, more efficient way for people to share data with each other. We see these as a win-win. We have these agreements with, let's say, ServiceNow, Salesforce, SAP with the recent partnership as well as Workday. These products continue to drive our broader mission to be at the center of all of the data needs that our customers have. And they just make the process of data collaboration between the SaaS vendors and Snowflake just a whole lot easier.

And we are very happy with these agreements. And what this means is that Snowflake will continue to be the place for our customers to get like that single -- that stable single pane of glass sort of view on everything that matters to them. And obviously, with agentic AI and agentic systems now, the value that you can get from the data is tremendous.

I can tell you from personal experience that I'm not thinking when I'm looking at my sales data agent, about whether this data comes from Workday or from Salesforce or from our own systems, I can focus on the logic of what needs to get done. And the rest of the stuff works as though it is magic. And so zero-copy agreements just make data flow more smoothly and I think are a big step forward for everybody involved Snowflake, but most importantly, our customers.

Our next question comes from Mark Murphy with the company JPMorgan.

Arti Vula
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

This is Arti on for Mark Murphy. Congrats on the strong quarter and continued momentum. I know you've touched on this thing throughout the call here, but we spoke to a Fortune 150 customer, recently and they described Snowflake as the most important piece of their AI and data strategy and explicitly stated that Snowflake budget is now tied to their AI budget, and they're kind of broadening their adoption of products on the Snowflake platform. So my question is, are you kind of seeing that sort of tying explicitly from customers of their Snowflake investments to the AI investments? And if so, how is this influencing the buying habits? Are they entering into larger, longer-term contracts? Are they adopting more products or just any new customer patterns you're seeing emerge?

Sridhar Ramaswamy
CEO & Director

Yes. The strongest pattern that we have had to work hard and earn this year is to be that genuine player when it comes to enterprise AI. And no amount of talking can make you that. You need project, products that produce the magic. And so building on earlier products like Cortex Analyst as well as Cortex Search, Snowflake Intelligence, the agentic platform that can use these different subproducts flexibly is the big unlock for us.

And what you're also seeing is a number of these customers have tried to string together agent systems by, let's say, creating MCP servers on tables and sticking them into our foundation model. And then they realize that solutions like that don't actually work all that effectively.

Part of what we provide are systems that can help them thoughtfully structure the data that then needs to be exposed to an AI agent and a careful amount of tuning that makes sure that these systems are failsafe, that they're reliable and can actually answer the questions they are supposed to. We also work with our customers on things like unheralded, but really important things like eval where they can judge ongoing performance so that they know that they're actually making their systems better.

It's a combination of all of this expertise. Yes, the partnership with the big foundation model providers to bring the best models as part of Snowflake, combined with our unrivaled expertise in data and modeling to help them create AI products that deliver value. And if you combine that with products like Snowflake Intelligence that now like are clearly valuable and useful for every business user, I think that's the narrative shift that you're seeing in a number of these companies.

And agentic AI is still evolving. We have a lot more to do. That's part of the reason why I keep repeating being in the center of enterprise AI because we are already the holders of the most valuable data that many of these enterprises have and then we are bringing the power of AI to get even more value from this data.

Operator

Your next question comes from Kash Rangan with the company Goldman Sachs.

Matthew Martino
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

This is Matt Martino on for Kash. Sridhar, I want to stick with the AI topic here. The number of customers leveraging Snowflake AI is accelerating very, very quickly within your installed base, and you're able to pull forward that $100 million in AI revenue, which very few of your peers have been able to do. From your perspective, what about the Snowflake platform is allowing customers to really accelerate their AI journeys? And maybe secondarily, do you see the market increasingly standardizing around a smaller subset of platforms to handle all their data requirements given your commentary about Snowflake really sitting at the center of the AI opportunity?

Sridhar Ramaswamy
CEO & Director

Yes. I think to take on your second question first, I think there is a lot of complexity in the data space. I know of the number of different tools that Snowflake, the company itself has had to use to have an effective data strategy and with things like Snowflake Intelligence and Streamlit, which we are very heavy users of, we are just able to do more with Snowflake. And again, investments like OpenFlow or even Postgres are going to expand the aperture of what we are able to tackle as the data platform.

Operator

Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with the company Wolfe Research.

Aleksandr Zukin
Wolfe Research, LLC

Maybe for either of you, Brian or Sridhar, clearly, the momentum that you're describing is showing up in bookings. So I just maybe better understanding the confidence and conviction around -- and maybe the direction of travel for the expansion rate as we continue to see some of these go-lives and an explanation of how the consumption patterns, particularly as you start to see customers leverage the AI portfolio and the other -- and the multiproduct portfolio more broadly?

And then, Brian, any timing elements? Last quarter, it seemed like there was a little bit more of a onetime bump or boost to product revenues from consumption from some very large deals in the quarter. But then this quarter, you also had 4 super large deals. So is there something where they maybe happened a little bit later. And last quarter, they happened a little bit earlier that maybe drove that beat magnitude cadence to be a little lower.

Sridhar Ramaswamy
CEO & Director

I can start with the first one. The virtuous cycle of Snowflake customer is one in which they sign a deal. It has a certain amount of slack capacity that is built into it, that our teams then use to expand into use cases that can deliver value for our customers.

And to actually address a previous question that I had left unaddressed, that was the first part of the previous question. Part of what drives broad adoption of AI with Snowflake is that we make it easy to do.

It's not a brand-new system. You don't have to resolve the existing problems like governance and access controls. And we have made it super easy to first build chatbots and then to build more complex agentic systems like Snowflake Intelligence, which is why some 1,200% -- 1,200 customers are already using Snowflake Intelligence. And as we expand and deliver value, these then naturally result in more confidence in more conviction on the part of the customer that they're getting value from Snowflake.

And remember, in all of this, they don't have to make any pre-commits towards AI. The value that they get is like it has to be delivered by the products that they build on top of Snowflake. This risk-free approach driven by our consumption model is what makes AI super attractive for our customers on top of Snowflake. We make it easy to use, we don't require them to commit and then they naturally expand out the ones that are creating value.

And I'll just touch on the second part of your question, and I'll hand off to Brian. Large deals that we sign don't tend to have immediate impact on revenue within the quarter. If anything, as soon as a large deal is signed, they typically get a better discount. So it tends to be slightly negative with respect to revenue.

But as I said, these are long-term cycles. Our customers on average sign deals with us once every 2.5 to -- 2.5 years-ish on average. It's not really directly tied to consumption and within a quarter, and I would not read too much into timing constraints like that. Brian?

Brian Robins
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Absolutely, Sridhar. I guess I would emphasize that product revenue is still the leading indicator of our business, and we saw that in really the migrations and increased use case wins. We're also happy with the developments in AI and also the data engineering workloads. We look at the consumption patterns up until today to inform our view of Q4. The quarterly beats are less indicative, especially in a consumption model. I would really look at the FY guidance as the best indication of the long-term business trends for a consumption model.

Our view of the business over the last 90 days has improved. And I think you can see that in our annual raise. This is also represented in the $7.9 billion in RPO, 37% year-over-year growth and all the new customer adds that we talked about in the prepared remarks.

Operator

Our next question comes from Patrick Colville with the company Scotiabank.

Patrick Edwin Colville
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

I guess, Sridhar and Brian, one for both of you, please. You passed the $100 million consumption thresholds, really impressive to see that. I guess what do you see as the next milestone? And then could you just remind us what does that $100 million actually include? Is that equivalent to the Cortex suite? Or are there other products that go into that $100 million of consumption that you achieved this quarter?

Sridhar Ramaswamy
CEO & Director

Yes. The $100 million is primarily the product suite, but it's the whole stack. It is Cortex AI and AI SQL. It's accessible from SQL also as a REST API. And then the products that stack up on top of that Cortex Search and Cortex Analyst, which are our unstructured and structured data products, respectively. And then Snowflake Intelligence, which builds on these building blocks to provide an agentic solution for data products. That's roughly the suite.

In terms of the next milestone, I think much broader adoption of Snowflake Intelligence is certainly that we are driving. There is no reason for us to not have every single data set that is in Snowflake, be AI-ready. And you're already seeing this play out in the collaboration space where instead of sharing a data set, you can, in fact, share an agent on top of that data set so that the recipient on the other side can straight out just start asking business questions of this data without needing to build dashboards and so on.

Obviously, in many situations, this data flows through programmatically and will be combined with other data. But my point is making all data in Snowflake AI consumable and making the act of making that AI consumable is something that we will be -- honestly be spending a lot of time on.

But the second and the third order impacts that I alluded to earlier, the pull-push analogy that I used. I think that's where the impact is going to be a lot more profound. I think migrating from legacy systems, bringing data into Snowflake using products like OpenFlow or being able to write data engineering workloads using our coding agents. All of those are going to get accelerated. I think that's where you're going to see like tremendous value that our customers can realize and tremendous potential for us as a business.

Next question comes from Brad Reback with the company Stifel.

Brad Reback
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Sridhar, the results are very impressive. The booking is super great. The op margin obviously down-ticked on the first half sales and marketing investment. As we look forward into next year and beyond, how do you think about balancing the huge opportunity in front of you and the ability to drive margin expansion?

Sridhar Ramaswamy
CEO & Director

I think we live in fortunate times where this is not an either/or. We clearly invested pretty heavily in our sales and marketing teams in the first 2 quarters because we saw a tremendous opportunity. And what we're going through now is a maturation of the folks that are here, and we expect them to aid us substantially. But we have also invested equally heavily in how do we make sure that we upskill our own labor force, whether it is engineers or solution engineers. We have rolled out coding agents for the folks. I talked earlier about how we want to make it super easy for every single rep, every single solution engineer to be able to do custom demos, custom POCs for our customers. Obviously, we have a big services team as well, making then AI native is a big transformation.

So the way we will -- the way we look at next year is, yes, we will continue to invest in the business, but I think there is also substantial gains to be had in just how efficient we are as a company. And I don't think of this as an either/or. We have had pretty healthy expansions in things like operating margin, but also things like SBC year-over-year, and we will continue to press hard on those things.

Brian Robins
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I'll just echo what Sridhar said. We can do both. It's not one or the other. Obviously, it's a really big market, and we've delivered impressive growth and we'll continue to do innovations in our product to drive that revenue growth, but we'll do that responsibly.

Operator

Our next question comes from Mike Cikos with the company Needham.

Michael Cikos
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Great. And Brian, congratulations again on the new role as CFO over at Snowflake. Looking forward to working together here. My question comes back to -- I think there's been a couple of different attempts throughout this call at understanding, frankly, the magnitude of the product revenue upside relative to the prior quarter, where, to be frank, last quarter was more significant, but I really -- I attributed it or I thought that you guys positioned it as last quarter really saw some very large customer migrations, which is outside your control.

And so the question is, when we think about the increased confidence you're talking about for the year, the traction for data engineering and AI, is it fair to think that 3Q here was just a strong execution quarter but maybe a more normalized return to typical migration activity? And then secondarily, just while we have everyone on the phone here, Brian, we would love to get your perspective on whether the guidance philosophy has changed at for the margin.

Sridhar Ramaswamy
CEO & Director

Yes. I'll start with the first one. We've consistently told all of you that we view a 3% beat as a very good beat. And anytime we do much better than that, we go back. Obviously, the ML models recalibrate and we calibrate ourselves back to the 3% beat. So -- and there is also a natural variability in a consumption business because this is literally the agglomeration of 12,000-plus enterprises deciding what they want to do with their data futures.

And so I view the Q3 beat as actually still a very solid beat at some 2.5%. And yes, the Q2 beat, and we are upfront with you about it, had some large migrations that also had onetime activities, but we also have cautioned to you that large migrations are lumpy and not all that easy to predict.

And that's roughly where we are. And as we look at things like Q4, we approach it the exact same way. We do the best job that we can of trying to figure out where we are going to land and use pretty much the same guidance philosophy as we have before. Brian?

Brian Robins
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks, Sridhar. Just to echo what Sridhar said as well, the quarterly variability is not the right way to evaluate the consumption model. Companies that do migrations, they don't do those due to our quarterly earnings calls. They basically -- we snap the chalk line and where they're at and their migrations are at. And so we really point you to the full year guide. And based on the behavior that we've seen up to the earnings call, we have the confidence to raise our full year guide to $51 million to 28% annual growth year-over-year.

Just from a guidance philosophy perspective, there's a number of things that I did when I first joined, but one of the things that I did was spent a lot of time with the team that wrote all the AI models. It does the forecasting on a daily business of our revenue. Super impressive team, very detailed, and I can assure you that there will be no change to the guidance philosophy.

Operator

The next question comes from that Matt Hedberg with the company RBC.

Matthew Hedberg
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Just a quick one for Sridhar. The $100 million AI run rate is super impressive. Wondering if you could give us just a rough sense for how quickly that's growing? And then maybe more of a detailed question. On the heels of crunchy data, curious if you can comment about just now that you've had more time, how customers are thinking about that long-term balance of OLTP and OLAP within Snowflake?

Sridhar Ramaswamy
CEO & Director

Yes. As I said, AI revenue is predominantly driven by the Cortex product suite, including Snowflake Intelligence. This is among the fastest products to get adopted by our customers because, as I said, the value is very, very clear as soon as someone uses Snowflake Intelligence. So we expect to -- we expect for this to continue to grow quite well. We don't really want to guide to it or hint at that right now.

With respect to Crunchy Data, it will take us a couple of more months to get the product into GA, but all of the early conversations that we have is that customers are very welcoming of Postgres support within Snowflake. They view Snowflake as an incredibly robust and reliable data platform. And for many kinds of applications, having them be hosted as part of the overall Snowflake deployment makes perfect sense for these folks.

For what it's worth, Unistore, which is our HTAP product, is also doing well. It addresses a different segment of the transactional data space. And we will continue to have both of these. But I think bringing Postgres to market will be an important step forward for us, especially for things like agentic solution that need an OLTP store to function effectively. So there are a number of those kinds of use cases that we are actively working with our customers on.

Operator

Our last question comes from Tyler Radke with the company Citi.

Tyler Radke
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Really impressive to see roughly $1 billion of RPO bookings in the quarter. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the 3 9-figure deals that you added in the quarter. How are those sort of structured from a duration perspective? And are you expected to see significant growth in those deals? In other words, were they large expansions?

And then just a follow-up for you, Brian. Anything we should be thinking about as it relates to FY '27, whether it's headwinds or tailwinds in the model? I know you're not giving guidance, but just as we think about new products, optimization headwinds, anything you'd call out?

Sridhar Ramaswamy
CEO & Director

Well, as a matter of fact, Tyler, we had 4 9-figure deals this quarter. All of these folks are customers that are spending significantly with Snowflake and are very positive about additional value that they can bring. But bookings are an indicator of how much a customer thinks they're going to spend in the coming years. Product revenue is the best indicator of how our collective customers are going to be spending on Snowflake next quarter. And so that's the thing that I would look at.

Brian, do you want to take the last question?

Brian Robins
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Tyler, as you mentioned, we'll guide to FY '27 on our next call. But what's really important is consumption after the holiday season, is the most important input for FY guidance for next year. And so we'll need to see the consumption behavior unfold in January, February, and that will give us better visibility to deliver that on our next earnings call.

Operator

At this time, I'd like to pass the conference back over to our host, Sridhar, for closing remarks.

Sridhar Ramaswamy
CEO & Director

Thank you, everyone. Snowflake remains at the center of today's enterprise AI revolution. And we at Snowflake are focused on empowering our customers throughout the end-to-end life cycle for data. This is an incredibly exciting time for the company as we continue to reimagine what's possible with AI and push the boundaries of innovation to lead in this new era. We continue to execute strongly as evidenced by our product revenue growth and strong outlook for the remainder of fiscal '26, and we see a long runway of durable high growth and continued margin expansion ahead. Thank you all.

Operator

That will conclude today's conference call. Thanks for your participation, and enjoy the rest of your day.
