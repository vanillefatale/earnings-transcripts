[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.


Matthew Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So in the U.S., could you speak to the cadence of demand that you saw in the third quarter, elaborate on trends quarter-to-date, maybe notably the slowing trend that you cited post Black Friday. And just larger picture, the time line that you see is reasonable for the product assortment to be fully optimized as we look to next year?


Meghan Frank
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Matt. I would say in terms of U.S. demand, the quarter progressed pretty much as we expected. We did come in line with our Q3 expectation. The best month was August, the softest month was October, but that was planned just based on some activities last year and did come in overall in line with expectation.

In terms of quarter-to-date, we're really pleased and saw a strong Thanksgiving period result. We have seen some pullback in demand post Thanksgiving in terms of traffic. We've reflected that in our guidance. And then in terms of the longer picture, we are, as we mentioned, focused on activating the newness that we have in the assortment as we move into Q1. We'll start to see the benefits of that in Q1 in terms of getting our newness penetration up. And then we're also leaning into those activation pieces we mentioned in terms of ensuring we get eyeballs in terms of marketing on that newness in our assortment across all of our channels in terms of stores and e-com.


Matthew Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. And then, Meghan, just taking all that into account on the product assortment changes, are there any puts and takes for us to consider as we model operating margins relative to this year? Any reinvestments for us to think about maybe as it relates to your comments on experience and activating newness as you outlined as we think about next year?


Meghan Frank
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. There will be some puts and takes in terms of margin as we look into '26. And obviously, we'll offer more color as we get into March, see some initial results in response to our assortment. We will have a full year of increased tariffs and the removal of the de minimis provision, offset, obviously, by the actions the team is taking to mitigate those expenses, and we have been making some good progress there. We will need to layer in back some certain expenses we reduced in '25, including incentive comp. And we're going after, I would say, expense savings overall and looking for efficiencies across the business. Bottom line, I would say that the negative factors would outweigh the positives as we move into '26, but the team continues to work on the efficiency side, and we'll give an update in March there.

The next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Group.


Dana Telsey
Telsey Advisory Group LLC

As you think about the segment, how did the segment perform this quarter versus how you performed? And then as you think about the newness that's flowing in, which segments should we be seeing first, what are you thinking about bottoms, about tops, about men's and women's? Any more clarification on that? And what are you looking for in the new CEO? What are you looking for in the new leader as you move forward?


Calvin McDonald
CEO & Director

Thanks, Dana. I'll take the first 2 parts of the question. In terms of the flow-through and what we've seen in the overall marketplace, we continue to see sort of pressure in the apparel space. We held share in premium athletic and lost some slight share in the performance apparel as we see guest behavior and trading down.

From a newness perspective, I'm pleased with the innovation pipeline and what you've seen and we'll see this quarter in terms of some of the updates to franchises like Scuba, in lounge, BeCalm, Big Cosy, Loungeful are new introductions that are performing well and in performance, the Milemaker as well as Shake It Out.

And as you know, as we head into spring, we're moving our new style penetration to 35%. That's going to be a balance of both innovation behind our performance active categories where we continue to see growth through Q3 as well as some other new items and new innovations across lifestyle. And we're going to be kicking off the year with the train campaign followed by some new introductions to some of our core franchises, including Scuba, Swiftly and ABC that the team is excited about.


Meghan Frank
Chief Financial Officer

And in terms -- Dana, in terms of the CEO, the search has begun. The Board intends to do a thorough process and really focused on a leader with experience in growth and transformation.

The next question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays.


Adrienne Yih-Tennant
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Yes. Calvin, thank you for all the hard work over the years and all the successful strategies in place going forward. I guess let me start with kind of the new product pipeline and the things that you'll be doing. How much of that new product has been sort of informed from primary research and from the customer directly?

And then, Meghan, can you talk about kind of price increases, what you've done season to date and any additional price increases for spring? And you had mentioned kind of maintaining operating margins or supporting them at current levels for next year. Can you give us a little bit more color on what that entails? And best of luck, Calvin.


Calvin McDonald
CEO & Director

Thank you, and thank for the best wishes. From a product innovation perspective, our process always begins with research, really focusing on solving for the unmet needs. And I believe the pipeline has a lot of those solutions, both across our activity as we continue to put our performance activity categories initiatives first across run, train, yoga, golf and tennis. You'll see a lot of innovation across all 5 of those activities in the yoga category as well we're kicking off, as I mentioned, train.

And we have a new performance fabric that's specifically designed for weight training that we're excited for. And then there's the ongoing updates to our core franchises as we've addressed and looked and using data to really look at our high-value guests into our core franchises and opportunities to bring newness and refresh those swiftly, some updates, our ABC pants for him as well as building on the success of Waffle Scuba seeing opportunities to innovate. So the team definitely focuses and targets using both our own data of our guest behavior as well as research with our ambassadors and collective community as to where the opportunities are.


Meghan Frank
Chief Financial Officer

And in terms of pricing, we haven't taken any other further pricing actions relative to what we discussed last quarter. So we took a small amount of the assortment up modestly. We've been pleased with the price elasticity on those actions, I would say, in line with our expectations from a revenue and margin perspective. It's an area we continue to keep our eye on, closely monitoring where the competitive landscape goes, but no imminent plans to go further there.

In terms of 2026 operating margin, it is fair to assume that the negatives will outweigh the positives. The margin push though will be a multiyear effort looking at efficiencies. It will be our first full year of tariffs, and we are looking for offsets. The team has been making some progress there. But I would assume we have some pressure next year, and we will be focused on it from a multiyear perspective.


Operator

The next question comes from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs.


Brooke Roach
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Calvin, Meghan, I was hoping you could speak to the performance of your largest franchises, both in the performance category and in lounge and social. Are these businesses large enough that you think that they warrant a reset in order to let the new product innovation shine and the new design language pop out to the consumer in a bigger way in '26 and beyond? And what proof points in the new design language are you currently seeing that gives you confidence that the new styles launching in '26 will change the trend rate that you're seeing in the U.S. today?


Calvin McDonald
CEO & Director

Thanks, Brooke. In terms of the overall focus of the team, it's definitely balanced across our activity areas of run, train, yoga, golf and tennis, with some lifestyle. And when we look at the core franchises today, as I've shared, we continue to see growth across our performance activity categories. And we have innovation behind those categories as well as next year as that is definitely our leading strategy. So you'll see innovation in our bottom legging business. You'll see innovation across our top business, all geared towards these key activities and unmet needs of our athletes.

And then on the lifestyle side, we continue to see growth in social, both on the back of the newness that we have brought in, Daydrift being a good example. And we have additional innovation next year in our men's bottom business, updating the ABC and bringing that silhouette as well for her that the team is excited about with some new fabric innovation.

And then lounge, which has been our core franchises where we've seen the greatest headwind. We can see that updating Scuba with new materials and silhouette changes, we see great response. So the team is leaning and doing more of that as well in China, Mainland China, we activated it and saw great results. So we know even internationally, a lot of these core franchises, although in North America, they have more saturation internationally and globally, they don't yet. So it's a balance to make sure we continue to drive the growth there and then reinvent here in North America.

And that really brings us to the overall balance and solution that the consumer is bringing. To your last point, Meghan mentioned, there's a lot of work going on in terms of in-store visual merchandising. We have some small tests going on in L.A., Miami, they are very much focused on exactly what you said, curating the stores, de-assorting, taking product out so that we could put focus on the newness and the guests can see that. And we're seeing very good results, and we're excited and plan to roll that out. That would be a key initiative so that our guests in the physical space can see the newness better than today.

And online, with the launch of our new web design, the teams have a lot more levers than they've ever had before through guest navigation and storytelling to put the newness front and center in front of the guests. And there, we're already seeing good results as well in terms of the adoption and the visibility to the newness. We'll continue to play those levers into the next year as the new product comes.

Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.


Lorraine Maikis
BofA Securities, Research Division

I was hoping to hear more about the Amex partnership. Can you quantify the impact to sales and margins? And then talk about, if it attracted a new or reengaged guest in line with your expectations?


Calvin McDonald
CEO & Director

Great. Thanks, Lorraine. I'll take the first -- or the second part of your question and then hand it over to Meghan. But from an expectation point of view, we've been pleased with it. We went in similar to some of these partnerships and initiatives we do, very much focused on guest acquisition and being able to grow both our men's guests as well as our female guest. And I would say on this partnership, although it's early, we're pleased with the results in the number of new guests that we've seen come through this partnership.


Meghan Frank
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And I would say in terms of the numbers, it's a relatively small part -- exciting part, a small part of our business. We haven't broken out specifics. But I would say we're pleased overall with the profitability of the program. We do have a share in the credits, and that is a reduction to revenue.

The next question comes from Michael Binetti with Evercore.


Michael Binetti
Evercore Inc.

Let me add my congrats, Calvin, to the next step. I think, Calvin, you did mention there are some signs of trade down in third quarter. I was just curious if you had any additional thoughts that you could share there and if that adds anything to your thoughts on using pricing as a lever for the mitigation efforts as we go forward. And then I guess as we look at the next year, I know you guys have been working on some of the multiyear DC projects for a while. I think there's a pretty big one in Canada that you've been working on for a long time that was scheduled to come online next year. There's been some questions about whether maybe that was originally intended to be used for some of the de minimis business. And I wonder if that's something you have to reposition on at this point or how you're thinking about that distribution center.


Calvin McDonald
CEO & Director

Thanks, Michael, and thanks for the best wishes. I'll take the first part. Meghan will take the DC network configuration. And in terms of the -- sorry -- yes, sorry, in terms of trading down, we've seen a bit of that behavior throughout the year. I've talked about the uncertain behavior of the consumer we're seeing. We're seeing a little bit in terms of how they're responding to the promotional activity in the marketplace today, and they're definitely looking for ways in which they can save in value. And it's behavior we've seen throughout the year and continued into Q3.


Meghan Frank
Chief Financial Officer

And I would say in terms of pricing, we've been really strategic with the pricing moves we've made. As I mentioned, we're pleased with that -- with the elasticities we've seen and are in line with our expectations from a sales and margin perspective. So I don't see any concern there related to what Calvin just mentioned. And again, we'll take that same stance as we move forward on an item-by-item basis.

In terms of the DCs, I would say, given the news on de minimis, the team is deep in the work on evaluating the network. I don't think it means we won't have a presence in Canada, but I do think it means some changes to our DC network, and we will make sure we're as most efficient as possible. I think we can share more as we move into '26 and the team is further along in that work stream.

The next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi.


Paul Lejuez
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Curious if you could talk a little bit more about the China business, what you saw in e-comm performance versus stores. And also curious how you would characterize the athletic apparel market in China in general? And if there are any big differences by city tiers?


Calvin McDonald
CEO & Director

Thanks, Paul. In terms of the performance of our business in China, and obviously, as the results indicate, we continue to see very good momentum, very pleased with the overall results. There were a couple of timing opportunities and shifts to platform activations that helped us in the quarter. But on those, when we activate, we show up as a brand with the least amount of discounting. We actually have a large number of reg sales as a percentage of our business. We were able to use that event to activate Scuba.

And as you know, we also have a lower outlet to store ratio, and we use these channels as a means to exit some of our markdown products. So those levers and that mix works well for that market. And obviously, we were really pleased with the overall results. We also saw very good success to our outerwear business, which is a very key important category within that market. And we continue to see guests respond very well to both existing Wunder Puff and styles as well as our new innovation, the Featherweight and other styles and silhouettes that we bring out.

Overall, we're definitely gaining share, gaining momentum in that marketplace, and the team there is executing very well. And we're seeing success across all tier cities. And we definitely, as we enter into the Tier 2, Tier 3 deeper, see the business and the brand continue to resonate and perform well.

The next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.


Brian Nagel
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

First off, Calvin, best of luck. It's been a pleasure working with you.


Calvin McDonald
CEO & Director

Thanks, Brian.


Brian Nagel
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

So with the leadership change, we've been talking for a while now about product refreshes and particularly a lot of new products set to hit in early '26. So I guess I want a 2-part question. I mean, does the leadership change, change the timing or any aspects of those product launches? And then I guess the follow-up, and I think this may be a bit of a follow-up, but I mean, what are you seeing now as far as consumer reception to the new products you have introduced? Are you -- is there a marked difference in how the consumer is reacting to those products versus some of your legacy items?


Calvin McDonald
CEO & Director

Great. Thanks, Brian. In terms of the team and confidence in the work that they've been working on for the past year, there's no change, and this shouldn't be perceived in terms of any lack of excitement and work that, that team has been creating. As I shared, I think, early on, the first season spring when I go back from -- to spring of this year, and we had all our regional teams in, the energy in the room was contagious and exciting. There is enthusiasm for the newness that's coming and shifting that mix to 35%. And there's work the team still has to do as we work and offset the life cycle of some of our core franchises. And that's the work they will continue to be in and have been in as the year progresses from season to season.

And relative to the newness, no change. We continue to see newness, what we believe to be future core items drive outsized growth in the U.S. and we're seeing our high-value guests as well as all of our guests respond and react well to those. And we know as a mix that is increasing next year, and that's just not the existing styles, but it's more styles to come. So overall, the batting average on the newness is very good, and the guest response is very strong, encouraging, pleased with that and encouraged that we have more of that as a composition of our mix moving forward. And the teams are focused on the areas where they're going to continue to offset where we see some of the headwinds.

The next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS.


Jay Sole
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

My question is on the co-CEO structure that exists now. Calvin, given your transition and Celeste transition, who is design reporting to, who is merchandise reporting to, who's ultimately going to make the final decision on what happens in terms of product and what gets made and what goes into the stores?


Calvin McDonald
CEO & Director

Thanks, Jay. First of all, it's a very strong leadership team that I have huge confidence in. And in terms of the co-CEO structure, Andre taking on the Chief Commercial Officer role and being able to provide his leadership globally to our markets and to our GMs will really continue in that capacity and excited to have him work with Carla and the North American team and bring new perspective and new insights and sharing from some of the other global markets where we've seen momentum and success. And the other team members will report to Meghan through the search process. So product, both merchandising and design will report into Meghan as well as brand.

And we've operated as a team of peers and challenging each other. And I expect and know that, that will continue to be the dynamics and look forward to how they continue to drive the business forward. What I would want to just remind you of is the dates. A lot of the decisions around design, product merchandising, the team has made, in particular, through the first half of next year. The teams are just completing the winter buy for '26. So the work has happened and a lot of that foundation is in place as the search occurs. So I think the team will work and execute the plans to the action plan that Meghan laid out, both on how to activate and leverage a lot of the test and learn initiatives that are underway. But a lot of the solid plans are in place to create the inflection that I know they've been working towards.

The next question comes from Janine Stichter with BTIG.


Janine Hoffman Stichter
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Good luck to you, Calvin. A question for Meghan, just on the puts and takes as we think about margins next year. Can you speak to how you're thinking about markdowns? They came in a little bit higher than expected in Q3. It looks like they step up a bit in Q4. Maybe talk about what you saw there. And then as you talk about aiming to increase full price penetration next year, just speak to your confidence in that? And is that more of something that we would see in the back half? Or could we see that as early as the first half?


Meghan Frank
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Janine. So this year, as you know, sales haven't met our expectations, and therefore, we have more seasonal inventory that we're clearing through, and that's reflected in our markdown expectations. As we started planning next year, we are taking a more conservative posture on inventory. We will manage inventory units below our sales plans in an effort to mitigate markdown exposure and use those chase capabilities I described to chase the trend on the upside. I would expect and we're planning for that dynamic to start in Q1. That said, we have multiple scenarios if the trend ends up being different than we think. But we are definitely taking, I would say, a more conservative prudent posture in terms of inventory management.

The next question comes from Mark Altschwager with Baird.


Mark Altschwager
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Calvin, best wishes for your next chapter. My question is for Meghan. I just was hoping we could zoom in specifically on the tariff de minimis piece. Last quarter, you gave us some dollar figures for gross and net this year and next year. It sounds like you're making some progress. I guess where are you seeing the progress? And would you be willing to share some updated figures on how you're thinking about the gross net impact both this year and next year?


Meghan Frank
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks, Mark. So we -- our outlook has improved this year in terms of tariffs. So we had 220 basis points of pressure on an annual basis in our last guidance. We've updated that to $190 million. It's about $210 million net impact. When we think about next year, we offered a $320 million number. We're not giving a specific number update there. As I mentioned, we are making progress. I would say some of the areas we're working on still are in the vendor negotiation space as well as our DC network and inventory placement to offset some of those costs as well as just efficiencies across the business. There will be some puts and takes in terms of next year's operating margin that we went through, and we're really focused on inflecting the business. So we'll give you more of an update there in March in terms of our operating margin perspective for next year.

That's all the time we have for questions today. Thank you for joining the call, and have a nice day.
