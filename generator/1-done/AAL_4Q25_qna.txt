Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham of Melius Research.

Conor Cunningham
Melius Research LLC

I was hoping we could talk about the hub structure a little bit. You have a bunch of fresh eyes looking at it right now. And clearly, there's a lot of questions about what's happening in Chicago. So I was hoping you could talk about how you view profitability by hub and then where you see the most upside from your hub standpoint in 2026 and beyond.

Robert Isom
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Conor. And I'll just dive right into Chicago. We've been flying to Chicago for 100 years, and it was where our first flight took place, in fact, and it's going to be part of our system for the next 100 years. When we look at Chicago, it's strategically important. It is something that we're going to grow back to where we were prior to pandemic to 500 flights. We feel that's rounding it out. That gets us to where we think that we need to be. And I'm really pleased with what I see from the results so far. Local customer mix is up 20%, loyalty acquisition is up 20%, co-branded credit card acquisition is up 20%. So we're making sure that we're doing best for our customers. And when it comes to Chicago, we would expect that it returns to the average profitability of our hub network. It's going to be our third largest hub, and we're going to get -- keep at work taking care of our customers and making sure that it performs as best as it possibly can.

Conor Cunningham
Melius Research LLC

Awesome. And then maybe we could talk a little bit about just the cost trajectory in 2026. I think -- I mean, you quantified what you expect for 1Q just from the storms, and that's helpful. But just -- it seems like 1Q is going to be your high watermark. So just how you think about the shape of the cost curve in '26 would be helpful.

Devon May
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks for the question. The construct we've given in the past is that at around mid-single-digit capacity for this year, we would expect our unit cost to be low single-digit growth. And that's what we would have experienced here in the first quarter. We expect the unit cost growth in that 2% to 3% range prior to Winter Storm Fern. So that's where we'll be for the year. I think quarter-to-quarter, it might move a little bit up or down depending on what's happening with the timing of certain maintenance events. But if we end up at mid-single-digit capacity, I would expect low single-digit CASM. As always, though, we'll be flexible with capacity depending on the demand and competitive environment we find ourselves in.

Our next question comes from the line of Catie O'Brien of Goldman Sachs.

Catherine O'Brien
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

So maybe just on the premium growth rate. I know you've shared that premium seat growth rate will be double Main Cabin seats at the end of this decade. And I think you've previously noted that's driven by 20% premium seat growth and 50% lie flat growth through 2030. I'm just wondering, what does that look like in 2026? How much seat growth is driven by premium? How quickly are you growing those lie flat seats? And how does this factor into your full year revenue outlook? Is there a mix shift benefit included? And how should we think about that?

Robert Isom
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Catie. I'm going to hand that off to Nat Pieper, our Chief Commercial Officer.

Nathaniel Pieper
Chief Commercial Officer

On the premium side, our premium performance in Q4 '25, premium RASM was superior to non-premium by 7 points, both domestically and internationally, very strong. And as we look forward into '26, by entity, you'll continue to see our premium mix improve. We're taking delivery of A321XLRs, our more 787-9P configuration, P standing for premium, and we'll continue to deploy more premium seats into international markets.

By entity, just quickly, if you think on the transatlantic side, demand there continues to be really strong across both products, all parts of our business, Heathrow, rest of Europe, et cetera, and our joint business partners seeing similar things. Premium holding up well in the Pacific as well as in our deep South Latin market, too. So you're going to continue to see richness. We see a lot of depth in the premium market, and we're really excited about American's product evolving, the customer experience investments we're making, all tuned to that premium traveler.

Catherine O'Brien
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Great. Nat, great to hear from you at your new gig. Maybe just one for Devon. You pulled forward your debt reduction target by a year once again, now expecting to be less than $35 billion by the end of this year instead of $27 billion. I think when I asked you at my conference last December, you said you contemplate what the right medium-term or longer-term leverage target would be once you got to under $35 billion. I know we're not there quite yet, but with the target approaching, how are you thinking about the balance sheet? And when the potential buybacks start to figure into the calculus again?

Devon May
Executive VP & CFO

Catie, listen, we are really pleased with the progress we've made on the balance sheet, not just over the last year, but really over the past 3 or 4 years. And we talk about the priorities, they remain the same. We focus first on taking care of our customers and making the right investments there, taking care of our team members, and then any investments we need to make back in the business.

And then beyond that, any free cash flow that we're producing, we are putting into the balance sheet. And that's what's allowed us to achieve this goal and achieve this goal a year early. But we still have a lot of work to do before we shift our focus to any sort of shareholder remuneration. We need to get inside of 3x net debt to EBITDA. That was our longer-term stated goal. We want to get to a BB flat credit rating. So some work to do still on the ratings and metrics side, but really happy with the progress we made so far.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of John Godyn of Citi.

John Godyn
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I wanted to ask a little bit about full year guidance. I think the narrative that we've heard from other airlines so far is that the year has started out very strong, and we've seen what people have interpreted as a bit conservative guidance in light of that. It sounds like you guys see similar trends based on how things have started the year. I just was hoping to kind of dialogue about how you would characterize your full year guidance and areas where you think there may be some conservatism, if that's how you see it at all.

Devon May
Executive VP & CFO

John, maybe I'll just start with the first quarter, which I think is really a 50-50 forecast at this point. We've attempted to capture the impact of Winter Storm Fern, but we'll know more about that impact over the next week or so, which is why we provided a little bit wider range here in Q1. I'd say for the full year, though, probably similar comments to what we've heard from others. I think if bookings continue at their current pace, this guide could prove to be conservative. But we'll see how the year plays out. Right now, we're a month in, and we're comfortable with this range.

John Godyn
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Got it. And if I could just follow up on a little bit of the Chicago commentary earlier. Completely appreciate your perspective on Chicago. One of the data points that was put out there by one of your competitors was the fact that you guys are potentially losing significant amounts of money in Chicago. I know you typically don't talk about hub level profitability, but I just wanted to give you a chance to kind of address that if there's anything to address there.

Robert Isom
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, John. Look, we're growing back Chicago. Pleased with what we see so far, as I said, customer action has been great. And we fully expect that Chicago will return to the profitability levels that had been at prior to the pandemic. And I'd just say this, we're doing all the right things from that perspective. But we're -- look, we're mindful of how we're positioned. And quite frankly, I wouldn't be out there bragging about profitability in a hub when 80% of your team members make a lot less than the market rate. So we're doing right by our team members. We're doing right by our customers, and we're certainly doing right by the community of Chicago, too. They welcome this kind of service. And the customers in Chicago, I can tell you, benefit from competition. So we're pleased with what we're doing, and we're playing our game, and we're going to make sure that we deliver for our customers.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker of JPMorgan Securities.

Jamie Baker
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So question -- another question on the full year guide. Last year, American contributed about 4% of the total Big 3 pretax profit pool. Based on your disclosures today and if we just kind of use consensus for Delta and United, that 4% goes to about 12% in 2026. So I get that you may not necessarily think in these relative terms. But when we think of that improvement, how much do you attribute to the macro? And how much is idiosyncratic to American? And so obviously, the Citi deal is a contributor. Is there any way you could parse that implied percentage of Big 3 improvement? That would be helpful.

Robert Isom
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Jamie. Well, I just -- I'd say this that, obviously, some of it is due to a macro environment that is positive. Clearly, we see supply and demand, especially for domestic coming back more into sync, and that definitely benefits American. But all the things that we're doing, as Nat mentioned, in terms of premium traffic, our strategy, I think, is paying off, too. So I don't know if it's 50-50 or 70-30, but it's a combination of both. And again, I'm pleased with the strategy we have. We're going to be a really efficient producer of ASMs going forward. And from a profitability perspective, the only other thing I'd just add is, yes, we expect to be a greater proportion of total industry profitability. And again, we have labor cost certainty. That's built into our numbers.

Jamie Baker
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. Okay. And then very quickly on the firm calculus, that $150 million to $200 million revenue impact, can I confirm that, that is net of recapture? Or actually, let me ask it differently. Of the lost revenue in the past week, how much do you forecast you recapture later in the quarter? Or are you just assuming that the totality of that revenue is gone for the foreseeable future?

Robert Isom
CEO, President & Director

Jamie, I'll start. Devon could help me out on this, too. Look, we're still in the midst of assessing where things stand. We're at 9,000 cancels. It's going to probably be more than that. So that's a couple of days of operation for the entire quarter. And so the impact has been certainly that people didn't want to travel to some of the places that are iced in, and we don't see a lot of that coming back. And the other thing is there's been a freeze on some level of bookings during this period as well. So as we take a look at it, I like what I see in February and March in terms of the bookings that we've seen. As we really round out January, I just -- I think a lot of that is probably foregone revenue and the fact that we've got a perishable product in terms of some people want to fly to some places on certain days.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank.

Michael Linenberg
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I want to just get back to Dallas. And as you think about building that into the largest airline hub, actually single airline hub in the world, when I look at this last year and I look at your op stats, it's been a tough year, but it does seem like that Dallas has had more than its fair share of bad weather. And I'm not here to sort of predict what I think weather is going to be like in Texas over the next few years. But you do have knock-on effects as that hub builds out. As you think about building that out, does that at all factor in your calculus and how it can impact the entire system, maybe weather there, just being so much of your system, being driven by the Dallas operation?

Robert Isom
CEO, President & Director

Thanks for that question. I'd just say this that Winter Storm Fern, it is something that is relatively unprecedented. I don't -- I won't say that it's never happened before, but we get this kind of storm once every 5 to 10 years in DFW. And having been here for over 10 years, that's been my experience. We recover as quickly as we can. But over the long term, DFW is the fastest growing -- one of the fastest-growing metro regions in the country. And the product that we're putting out is fantastic. As we think about growing, though, reliability is key.

So one of the things that we're doing this coming year is reassessing how we bank our operation and pulling down the peaks quite a bit. So you'll see us convert to a 13-bank operation, yet still have presence in local markets that's equal to the biggest banks anybody else flies. At the same time, we're making sure that our facilities can keep up with that. You've heard about the new DFW Terminal F, which is just progressing at a great rate. But we'll be opening up a new satellite on Terminal C later this year and also on Terminal A.

So we're going to make sure that we have the facilities, the schedule that works for it. And then the final piece is we're working on airspace as well. So we're always going to have to take care of irregular operations events, and we'll thaw out here. Don't worry about that. And mother nature has a way of hitting everybody equally over time. But I really like what we're doing in terms of making sure that we're as reliable as possible. And then also, we're going to continue to invest in making sure that our irregular operations recovery is the best in the business.

Michael Linenberg
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And then just a follow-up on the Dallas. As you build that out, sort of where -- and maybe this is for Nat as well, just where the connect versus local split is today? And as you add, you build that up, where does that -- what does that evolve to? How does that shift, if at all?

Nathaniel Pieper
Chief Commercial Officer

Thanks, Mike. I think the mix actually stays pretty similar. We're going to be more -- create more utility for local customers with different alternatives. But I think the way we manage Dallas as it goes to 1,000 departures eventually is the cornerstone of our network. And you hit the nail on the head in asking the question. I look at it as trying to maximize revenue for American across our entire system. And having an operationally reliable DFW, the engine behind everything we have in the domestic U.S., it really becomes a no-brainer. So we're really excited about the potential and the enhanced utility for local DFW customers.

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research.

Scott Group
Wolfe Research, LLC

So can you just help us think about overall capacity growth for the year? And then I guess with what I think you'll say is something north of GDP, like what's the confidence in sustaining strong RASM throughout the year with more elevated capacity? And maybe just help us think about like how much the credit card -- the new credit card helps on RASM this year.

Devon May
Executive VP & CFO

Scott, yes, for capacity for the year, we didn't give a guide to you, but I would expect for the first quarter, as we said, it's going to be up in the 3% to 5% range. Ideally, we would have been a little higher than that. I would expect a similar level of capacity growth right through the summer peak. And then as we always do, coming out of that summer peak, we'll adjust capacity depending on the competitive and demand environment that we're seeing. But if it holds and if kind of our expectations hold, we'll probably have capacity for the full year around mid-single digits. We like the opportunities we have. We've talked a lot about growth opportunities in Philadelphia, Miami, Phoenix, along with rounding out our schedules in Chicago. And we do think even with this level of growth, we'll have a supportive environment for positive unit revenue throughout the year.

Just one quick note on the loyalty side, too, part of your question. As the AAdvantage program continues to grow, enrollments are growing extremely rapidly for us. And AAdvantage members are the lion's share of our premium revenue, the lion's share of our flown revenue. And as we continue to grow that program, it just generates loyalty to American, and that's going to translate into higher unit revenue as well.

Scott Group
Wolfe Research, LLC

Just a quick follow-up. So like when you guys announced the new card and gave us like a multiyear like earnings contribution from that, is there a reason to think '26 is -- is that a linear growth in '26? Or is it front-end loaded in any way?

Devon May
Executive VP & CFO

No, I'd say it's all pretty linear. It's never going to be perfectly linear, both in terms of remuneration that we get. Sometimes it will come in a little chunky depending on different bonuses that might be there and also just in the impact of the P&L. It won't be perfectly linear, but it will be fairly linear over the next 5 years.

Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Stathoulopoulos of Susquehanna Financial Group.

Christopher Stathoulopoulos
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

On ORD, I heard a target of, I think it was 500 flights. So where does that sit? And assuming that's -- I'm not sure if that's for this year or next, but how should we think about that within the context of the midpoint of the guide? And then at 500, does that put you back at profitability for that hub?

Robert Isom
CEO, President & Director

I'll just comment again. We anticipate getting back between 500 and 550 flights. That will happen this summer. And we are on track and meeting the goals that we had established for ourselves. And again, Chicago is strategically important. And at the end of the day, it's going to help system -- overall system profitability, but we fully expect that Chicago will return to its position as one of our mid-level profitability hubs.

Christopher Stathoulopoulos
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Okay. And then on the $1 billion in savings realized, if you could talk about opportunities going forward. I think in the past, you've spoken about technology and -- or AI benefiting areas such as MRO and procurement. Maybe if you could expand on that in other potential areas.

Devon May
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. This is something we've been at for over 3 years now, just really trying to reengineer our business for efficiency and making investments that drive productivity and a better customer experience. I'll say no major change. Obviously, we'll lean into the latest technologies like AI and the opportunities it brings, both areas like tech ops and reservations. A lot of the work, though, just continues to be streamlining processes and making regular way technology investments that drive improvements across our labor line with productivity improvements that are improvements for our customers. We also focus heavily on procurement, where we think we've built the best procurement team in the world that's driving really significant savings as well as working capital improvements. So this is a continuation of a year's long effort. It's a mindset for the company. It's an area that Robert and I get to meet on with leaders across the company every month. We think we're best-in-class, and we'll continue to focus there.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Savi Syth of Raymond James.

Savanthi Syth
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

I wonder if you can talk a little bit about operations. Clearly, Fern is just an outlier here, but some of the investments that you're making in DFW, when do you expect to see that? And in Chicago, not necessarily -- there seems to be a lot of flights being added just industry-wide in Chicago. And just any thoughts on kind of how that operation might impact, but really looking at it at a high level, but also wondering if kind of the level of flying in Chicago is a concern.

Robert Isom
CEO, President & Director

So I'll just start with DFW again. We have this facilities project that is going on that's been in the works for some time right now, new Terminal F, which is going to be American's terminal, new satellites on Terminals A and C. Those are progressing really well. I think that they're going to be really spectacular from a customer experience perspective and enable DFW to get to over 1,000 departures, and we're really pleased with that work. And regarding Chicago, again, I'll just say that we're flying to the places that our customers want to go and it warrants rounding the schedule back out to between 500 and 550 flights and really look forward to putting forth a great product this summer. We've done it before. We'll do it again. And that's what I have to say on that front. I can't really speak to what others are doing.

Savanthi Syth
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

I guess, Robert, my question is coming from operations. I have no doubt that there's appetite in Chicago for American to kind of come back there in a big way. I'm just kind of curious about, one, like the changes you're making at DFW, how you expect that to improve operations throughout the year, like when we will see the biggest benefit? And two is kind of the level of operations that are going to happen in Chicago this summer, not just American, if there's a concern in terms of if the airport can handle that.

Robert Isom
CEO, President & Director

Well, Savi, in terms of what we're doing in DFW, it's not only the facilities work, but it's technology we're bringing to bear. So whether that's making sure that we have the appropriate solutions to disruptions during the summer with smart gating and Connect Assist. We have new block time targets, which means we've assessed how we're building things out all into this 13-bank schedule. We really think that, that's going to show performance throughout the entire year, but I would expect a notable benefit during the summer. And for Chicago, look, this is a lot of growth for us, again, but it's only getting back to where we were. So we're putting a tremendous amount of time and effort to making sure that we're ready and that all of our partners are ready to go as well. So we've got all eyes on it and ready for the growth that we have planned for Chicago this summer.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Atul Maheswari of UBS.

Atul Maheswari
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I also have a question on the full year guidance. It sounds like to get to the midpoint of the range, you're not necessarily assuming current booking strength to persist. A, could you confirm that? And then b, to achieve the high end of the range, would you need the current demand to continue at these levels? Or would that drive even more upside over and above the high end of the range?

Devon May
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I think you're interpreting our comments correctly that we've seen really strong bookings in the first part of the year. If bookings continue at this level, we would probably be a lot closer to the high end of the guide. We haven't built that in for the entire year. To come in above the high end, it would probably require some acceleration of what we're seeing right now.

Atul Maheswari
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, as you look out over the next few years, what do you think is a sustainable long-term margin rate for American either with respect to EBITDAR margin or the pretax margin, whatever you want to pick? And relative to where you land in FY '26, what are the key drivers that get you to that long-term sustainable margin rate?

Robert Isom
CEO, President & Director

Well, what we're working on is this. We're going to continue to be the most efficient producer of capacity in the business. And I feel great about what we're doing. And Devon highlighted some of the things that we've embarked on with reengineering the business. But our focus right now is delivering on our revenue potential, and that's going to push margins, we believe, the most. So it starts with delivering a customer -- a consistent elevated customer experience. You've heard us talk about a lot of things we're doing, whether it's from a facilities perspective, reconfigurations of our fleet, the new flagship suites and flagship lounges, Everything that we do for our customers is being looked at in a way to enhance that.

On top of that, we have a network that is getting back to scale and size. And I feel that where we're flying is where people want to go, and we're going to make sure that we maximize the power of that network, and it's powered by the youngest fleet that's out there. You know about the work that we're doing with Citi with the relaunch of our co-branded credit card relationship. Feel great about the AAdvantage loyalty program and that being the best in the business. And then ultimately, we're going to sell and market our product and make sure that we stay on top of our share and our ability to really drive performance through sales, marketing and revenue management. All that combines to put us in a position where we anticipate margin growth. I think that, that then fuels free cash flow production, a stronger balance sheet and getting really American back on track with where we had hoped we'd be a couple of years back. So that's what I expect, and I appreciate the opportunity to expand on it.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI.

Duane Pfennigwerth
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I just wanted to ask you about your window into government travel. Obviously, there was a fair bit of noise in the fourth quarter, and we have some noise at least in the last week from Mother Nature. But are you seeing signs of stabilization or growth in the government segment as we begin to comp really severe DOGE impacts last year?

Robert Isom
CEO, President & Director

Okay. I'll handle that. Look, what I can tell you is that we -- our government traffic in the fourth quarter was down about 50%, and that's largely driven by the government shutdown. As we move into the first quarter, it's still too soon to see how that's going to come back. But we've built into our forecast assumption that we'll have to be out there and working hard to win back government business.

But over time, I would anticipate that the government traffic returns. Washington is always going to be really important. And I do believe that our Washington National hub does something for customers that no other airport can really do. And when government travel comes back, we're going to be the best position to take advantage of it. So I look over the long run as that being upside to us.

Duane Pfennigwerth
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And then just on premium, I don't know if there's any way to frame it on a relative basis, premium as a percent of total seats, where you are today versus your network peers? And as you look at like the growth you're lining up over the next few years, where does that go to?

Nathaniel Pieper
Chief Commercial Officer

I think -- Duane, it's Nat. I think from a network peer perspective, not deep into that. I can speak though on the American side, not only taking delivery of aircraft, but mod programs that we've got going on with our A319s, our A320s, 100-plus airplanes in those buckets and then longer-term 777 modifications, both the 200s and the 300 fleet. So clearly enhancing the premium product and the offering that we have out there. Premium economy continues to be very successful for us, too.

Robert Isom
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Duane, in terms of just real numbers, 30% growth as we take a look in premium seating out towards the end of the decade and 50% growth from a lie flat international perspective as we move out towards the end of the decade. And in terms of overall premium revenues, I don't think we're a lot different than our competitors. We see about 50% of our revenue being driven by premium offerings. And that's something that, again, we've got a product lineup and a strategy that is really directed at meeting those customers' needs.

Nathaniel Pieper
Chief Commercial Officer

And the other piece to it as well is just a recovery on the sales and distribution side, which drives premium revenue as well, getting back to our indirect share, which we mentioned in the script and then just having a more reliable, better customer experience, more reliable operation suited to that specific segment, we expect to continue to participate actively and grow that share.

Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, the floor is open for media questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Niraj Chokshi of New York Times.

Niraj Chokshi
The New York Times Company

I was just wondering if on the topic of Fern, can you guys help us understand why was American so disproportionately affected? Just looking today, like United Delta Southwest have very few cancellations and American has about 750 so far.

Robert Isom
CEO, President & Director

Thanks for the question. I can tell you from having spent the night on campus here that the DFW area is a little bit different. And let's face it, DFW is big in our operation. Almost 1/3 of our team members reside in the area. Conditions here are still a skating rink. And I'm super proud of what our team has done in terms of getting the operation back. We're trying our best to make sure that we cancel in front and do that in a way that gives customers the most advanced notice, but there's no mistake.

DFW is still in the thick of it, and we've got to saw out a little bit today. I do think that the sun is going to come out and roads will improve quite a bit, so our team members can get back in place. But this Fern, it hit not just DFW, but it hit Charlotte and then went up the coast. So it hit our system 5 out of our 9 largest operations, all at the same time. I believe that we've got a couple more days of digging out.

I want to apologize to our customers, certainly doing everything we can to make sure that they are taken care of. And then the last thing is our team. They're the ones who are fighting the elements trying to make it in. And there's no hiding it. Again, it's an ice rink out there in DFW. And it's safety, safety, safety. So from the perspective of canceling flights, it's done for the purposes of making sure that we don't put anybody in harm's way. We'll work out of this. We're the best in the business at this, and we'll be back on track as we get towards the end of the week.

Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I would now like to turn the conference back to Robert Isom for closing remarks. Sir?

Robert Isom

Thanks, Latif. And I'd just like to say thanks for dialing in. We know who we are. We're a premium global airline. We're out there every day, even in these ridiculous weather conditions, caring for people on life's journey. We have a focused plan this coming year to deliver on our revenue potential. And it starts with making sure we have a fantastic customer experience. We're going to maximize the power of our network and just love the areas that we're going to be growing this year. We have a loyalty proposition that's second to none and relationship with Citi is really going to kickstart value production this year. And we're going to keep up the momentum in terms of selling our product effectively, making sure that we regain and hold our share with our most -- all of our customers. And at the end of the day, we have a fantastic team. We do a great job of producing an efficient level of capacity and making sure that we're taking care of our customers. So I appreciate the interest and look forward to delivering for our customers and our shareholders.
