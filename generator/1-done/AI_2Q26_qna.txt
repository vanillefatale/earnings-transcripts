And our first question today comes from the line of Patrick Walravens of Citizens.

Patrick Walravens

Great. And Stephen, nice job stepping in here and driving the bookings. I thought it might be helpful if you could just sort of take a step back. I mean 2 quarters ago, this company was growing in the mid-20s and the gross margins were closer to 70% and now the business is shrinking and the gross margins are down and the losses are big. And I think some of us understand sort of the setup that you walked into. But if you could just take a minute and explain why the business fell off by so much? And then the steps you're taking to bring it back, big picture, I think that would be really helpful?

Stephen Ehikian
Chief Executive Officer

The biggest thing I would say is sales execution, and Tom hit on this last quarter, fell off. It was totally unacceptable, and Tom would probably acknowledge that his health contributed towards that. So I think he spoke at that at length on the last call. That was attributed towards the poor performance. But I can say this, being in here for 90 days now, the demand for C3 and enterprise AI is only accelerating. I've been actually surprised coming in here how much bigger the opportunity was than when I first came in. So the market is there, the product itself. I've spent catalyst meetings with customers and prospects and partners. We have a world-class product.

And I hear this. I see that the NPS scores, but I'm also seeing this in the amount of economic value we've been delivering. And I think that was maybe lost sight earlier this year. When we actually focus on delivering real value, the actual results come. I think GSK is a great example of that. That started off as an IPD to do like demand forecasting accuracy. They saw real value and that converted into an enterprise-wide agreement.

So from my perspective, we need to focus on more of those opportunities, be very disciplined. I can tell you what I'm seeing going forward. We have the plan in place and the operational rigor to go deliver on this. And the last thing I'll highlight is we have the talent density. I've been part of a lot of great teams. This is the best team I've been a part of, not just pure intelligence but people who truly care about the customer. And I see that every day. I hear that from our customers how much they love, not just the technology, but the people.

And the last thing on my side, I would say, Tom Siebel -- obviously, everyone knows Tom is a phenomenal businessman, entrepreneur, philanthropist, but he's also been a phenomenal mentor and support of mine. So I just say thank you, Tom. It's been incredible 90 days and very excited for Q3.

All right. Fantastic. And then just a follow-up, and I know you're not guiding to it, but just in general, how is your confidence in getting this business back to growth and profitability?

Stephen Ehikian
Chief Executive Officer

I would say Q2 execution was very strong. It was solid results. I'm confident in the opportunity ahead of us. We got to execute, Pat. I mean, there's work to be done. So I'm not going to say it is easy. But I know the market is there, the technology can deliver. It's purely like I got to drive this business is what you're hearing from me. And I believe we have the plan in place to go do so.

And our next question will be coming from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham & Company.

Matthew Calitri
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

This is Matt Calitri, on for Mike Cikos, over at Needham. I wanted to start with a clarification. Hitesh, you mentioned $21.9 million during the quarter. I forgot exactly how you described it. But was that from demo licenses? Was that what that was?

Hitesh Lath
Senior VP & CFO

That is correct.

Matthew Calitri
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then sticking on the revenue line, it was quite a big change in mix between Subscription and ProServ. I know you've talked about Professional Services generally staying within 10% to 20% of revenue long term? Any changes to that outlook? Is there any reason it should stay at these levels or anything to think about there?

Hitesh Lath
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I would say in the long term, we would expect ProServ mix to continue to stay between 10% to 20%. Our Professional Services mix this quarter was on the lower side. That was primarily due to lower PES revenue. And PES, we sell these Prioritized Engineering Services on an opportunistic basis to some of our large customers. So that is -- we had a lower PES revenue just because of the low demand this quarter. But on a go-forward basis, we would generally expect to be between 10% to 20% ProServ mix, as I mentioned.

Matthew Calitri
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Okay. And then maybe on the public sector, pretty strong bookings growth despite some of the headwinds you guys spoke about. Just wondering what your view is there for the rest of the year going forward? And obviously, any lingering impacts of this extended shutdown?

Stephen Ehikian
Chief Executive Officer

The strength of the Federal business is going to be a durable growth engine for C3. There's multiple factors, and I'm kind of late in my time in government and on the other side of this, there's a big push within the government to buy more commercial-off-the-shelf solutions. So moving away from government built. So that's one big tailwind. The other is this push to drive AI adoption for the AI Action Plan, and I think there's -- every single, almost virtually every agency is reevaluating their AI plan of which solutions are in place and they're doubling down on areas where they can actually get real value.

I would say the third big piece is the reindustrialization of such things is the Maritime Industrial Base. These are multiple years of generational changes in terms of investments to prepare ourselves. And we are benefiting from all 3 of those trends: cost focus, the AI Action Plan adoption and the reindustrialization of the Maritime Industrial Base.

Our next question will be coming from the line of Brian Essex of JPMorgan.

Brian Essex
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Stephen, great to see the color that you provided on how you're approaching, maybe getting the company back on its feet. I guess if we think about facilitating a pathway to better growth, and I think you gave some nice detail around incentives or initiatives that you've done with the management team to maybe drive accountability. Are there a few North Stars that you could point to where you're setting expectations and holding management accountable for delivering better execution going forward?

Stephen Ehikian
Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Honestly, it's starting with the small things. And a big driver of our growth is going to be the IPD motion. That is the most efficient way for us to deliver value to the market and our customers. So it's the qualification of IPDs, it's the rigorous evaluation in setting milestones and working very closely with our customers. If I just say the one thing we need to do better is to continue to drive a rigorous evaluation and delivery of value as fast as possible. I find when we actually deliver economic value quickly, it converts much faster.

So I think the direct correlation, you can expect my focus will be on that going forward. The technology is there, it's literally demonstrating value as fast as possible in these sales cycles. So that's my North Star.

Brian Essex
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Are these initiatives tied back to, I guess, discrete metrics that we can see, kind of looking from the outside, whether it's like Bookings or Subscription revenue? Or how might we kind of evaluate progress as you kind of execute on your plan over the next number of quarters?

Stephen Ehikian
Chief Executive Officer

I would say bookings is going to be the leading indicator of how to evaluate C3 as well as the growth in the IPD and Production revenue.
