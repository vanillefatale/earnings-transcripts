[Interpreted] The first is on food delivery. What is the duration that the JD will be committed to invest at this loss-making period as part of customer acquisition? And what's the progress in improving economics and commissions and business models like the 7Fresh and even coffee across the 7Fresh brands?

Second question is on general merchandise, seeing very healthy growth there in 3P. So how do we plan to further strengthen the competitive edge in the 3P categories, supermarket, health and apparel in terms of speed, selection, quality and price?

We have been optimizing operational efficiency and improving UE.

[Interpreted] So in the third quarter, JD Food Delivery maintained healthy growth trend. JD Food Delivery GMV achieved double-digit growth quarter-on-quarter. Alongside order volume growth, we also delivered a healthier order mix with a proportion of mill or mail orders steadily rising and contributing `to a bus majority of our total order.

At the same time, average price per order also increased quarter-on-quarter compared to Q2 meet intensified competition. So this is remarkable. While scaling up overall investment in food delivery in JD Food Delivery business in Q3, narrowed sequentially thanks to the UE improvement, the revenue contribution of food delivery is still limited as we are implementing a commission-free policy for merchants and only started to generate limited advertising revenues.

That said, our team has made solid progress in improving operational efficiency, including enriching supplies the number of high-quality restaurant merchants continue to grow in the quarter. And we also further improved our subsidy efficiency with refined operations and tailored subsidy strategy to different regions, user groups and order types. In addition, as we continue to upgrade our underlying system capability we have seen better operating efficiency. We also launched our new business, 7Fresh Kitchen model in July, which address full safety concerns through supply chain innovation. Our goal is to ensure that consumers can enjoy their meals with peace of mind and at the same time, help quality restaurant improve profitability.

Since its launch, 7Fresh Kitchen has been welcomed by our customers with a rapid increase in its order volume. It has also boosted sales and order growth of other quality restaurants within the 3-kilometer range. By the end of this year, people will see more semi-fresh kitchen in the region of Beijing.

[Interpreted] Looking ahead, we'll drive our strategic progress with a long-term perspective and focus on long-term ROI. Our goal is to create a sustainable business that drives healthy order growth and at the same time, gradually and long scale effect and enhance operations with better UE.

Ultimately, JD food delivery should be a self-sustaining business. Moreover, food delivery is deeply integrated into JD overall ecosystem. We believe there is significant potential for synergies in user momentum, supply and fulfillment within our ecosystem. The way of our business working together is not simply adding 1 and cutting another. JD user acquisition costs -- in the long term JD-user acquisition cost will decrease. And at the group level, we are committed to driving sustainable growth while maintaining profitable and cash flow sufficient.

[Interpreted] Regarding your question about our general merchandise category, as I mentioned before, it has sustained a 4 quarter consecutive double-digit growth key categories, especially supermarket, health, fashion and home goods all delivered very strong growth. We see significant growth potential in general merchandise, including supermarket and fashion as our users have substantial unmet demand, we have clear growth strategy for each of these key categories.

First, on supermarket categories, we focus on improving user mind share and user penetration through promotions such as -- through our promotions such as Black Friday and Super 18 will build stronger user mind share of our supermarket offering. Supermarket category will also take the opportunity of our rapid user growth on the platform to drive healthy -- higher penetration and conversion.

We have been optimizing costs and improving operational efficiencies through our supply chain capability, providing more competitive price to our user which validates the economic scale of our 1P model. Our supermarket category has made solid progress in this area and build strong competitive -- competitiveness compared to other models online and offline. At the same time, we will collaborate with brands further refine our operations and build categories with strong JD mind share and growth potential such as liquor, baby and mom products and household cleaning categories or all have already established strong user mind share, we expect to make breakthroughs in other categories as well.

Sean Shibiao Zhang
Director of Investor Relations

[Interpreted] Overall, our strategy for the general merchandise category is very clear. We are confident in the growth potential and market opportunity in the general merchandise sector as we enhance operation and user mind share. General merchandise is an important pillar of JD growth metrics and will support our long-term sustainable growth. We can take the next question, operator?

Your next question comes from Alicia Yap with Citigroup.

Alicis a Yap

[Foreign Language]

[Interpreted] So can management share with us the synergies on general merchandise category that benefit from the food delivery traffic, most of your food delivery users come from loyal JD user -- and what is the retention rate of the newly acquired user through the food delivery? Would you be able to quantify and share the cohort of new food delivery users who become active user of JD Core retail user. And second question is can management update us on your latest AI strategy and investment. Can you elaborate how AI has helped on JD's Core business? And how do we think about the financial impact?

Ian Su Shan
Chief Financial Officer

[Foreign Language]

Unknown Executive

[Interpreted] Thank you, Alicia, for your questions. I will take the first one. So as JD Food Delivery drives healthy development, we also see it's generating deeper synergies with JD Retail. First, on the user growth and user engagement side. In Q3, DAU of JD app maintained a rapid growth with growth rates leading the industry.

Our quarterly active customers and user shopping frequency, both recorded over 40% year-on-year growth in the quarter. As we continue to provide quality food delivery, we have seen JD food deliveries user retention rate maintained at a relatively high level and at the same time, boost our overall user engagement and user shopping frequency, while serving our high-quality existing users, our food delivery business also attracts new users to our platform.

Our annual active customer number surpassed the milestone of 700 million in October, reflecting our expanding user base and increasing user stickiness. At the same time, we will be accelerating the deployment and further optimizing our user conversion strategies and tools based on the preferences of food delivery users -- we have been providing retail product selection and recommendation in a more precise way, thus driving better user conversion. We have seen that the conversion rate of the new users acquired by JD Food Delivery has been trending up month by month. And for the earliest group of such users, their cohort conversion has reached close to 50% in Q3.

[Interpreted] Second, on the cross-sell side, we will see a stronger trend of cross-category purchases of food delivery users, particularly of our general merchandise category including supermarket products and live services. We believe food delivery will create new growth momentum to our general merchandise category as it attracts new users and drives up shopping frequency of our existing users.

In addition, 3D food delivery has also accelerated the development of our on-demand retail business. We will build a dedicated team that pays close attention to this area. Going forward, we will continue to accelerate the synergies between food delivery and core retail business, in terms of user momentum, cross-category purchases and marketing. In addition, we will tap into more synergies of our broader business ecosystem driving healthy progress in our user base expansion, revenue growth and efficiency improvement.

Sean Shibiao Zhang
Director of Investor Relations

[Interpreted] I'll answer the second question. So we are in the new era where we see a lot of new opportunities in AI and significant value of business model reform. JD has built a solid comprehensive AI capability framework that covers infrastructure models, platforms, application scenarios and products.

Over the next 3 years, we will make a sustained investment to foster a trading RMB scale AI ecosystem across various industries. So at our JDB conference, in September, we have unveiled JD AI strategy road map and launch flagship AI product, including our JD AI TaTaTa and all-purpose digital human assistance and JoyInside an AI agents for robot toys, devices and among others.

Xu Ran
CEO & Executive Director

[Foreign Language]

Sean Shibiao Zhang
Director of Investor Relations

[Interpreted] In terms of application, JD's differentiation is that we have extensive application scenarios, including retail, logistics, health care and industry -- other industry sectors -- so taking both retail and logistics, as example, in retail use case, we are providing merchants with over 50 AI tools, such as AI systems, AI agent for advertising allocation and [indiscernible] MDM to help them -- help merchants enhance efficiency and lower cost in content generation marketing, supply chain management and customer service.

We also redefined e-commerce experience in the AI era. We launched a smart search and recommendation function through natural language interaction, it can precisely understand user needs and delivering a huge breakthrough in shopping efficiency and truly personalized shopping experience.

In the logistics use case, while our logistic robots have been deployed across more than 20 provinces in China and over 10 countries globally, covering the entire logistics chain from warehousing, sorting to transportation and distribution.

Looking ahead, the expanding deployment of logistic robots autonomous vehicles and drones will further reduce logistic costs in the society, increase our business partner efficiency and keep optimizing shopping experience for our consumers. Okay, operator, we can take the last question.

Your last question comes from Thomas Chong at Jefferies.

Thomas Chong

[Foreign Language]

[Interpreted] My first question is about our ecosystem development, including the number of 3P merchants contribution as well as the expectation over the next few quarters. And my second question is about the outlook in terms of our profitability and margin in the next few years.

Ian Su Shan
Chief Financial Officer

[Foreign Language] My first question is above our ecosystem development

Xu Ran
CEO & Executive Director

[Interpreted] Thank you, Thomas. We've actually made solid progress in developing our platform ecosystem with a set of indicators growing at a very rapid pace. So in Q3, our active merchant number grew by over 200% year-on-year.

We have onboarded more top-tier merchants as well as merchants from industrial belts, providing users further enriched product offering. Meanwhile, our food delivery business has also brought in a large number of quality restaurants to merchants. We have also seen positive feedback from users. In Q3, the number of users who shopped our 3P offerings grew at a fast pace of over 50% year-on-year, outpacing the growth of our total users reflected in the financial results our commission and advertising revenues have been on a very rapid growth trajectory with growth rates accelerating to 24% year-on-year in Q3, which is the highest pace since Q2 2022.

Thomas Chong

Xu Ran
CEO & Executive Director

[Interpreted] We believe our platform ecosystem has a lot of potential. In particular, we will further explore industrial belts to onboard more merchants -- we will also continue to expand our full delivery merchant base to enrich local supplies for our 3P ecosystem.

In addition, we will continue to strengthen our platform infrastructure and provide more tech tools to merchants with the goal to help them enhance operating efficiency on our platform. We will also optimize merchant operation rules and traffic allocation efficiency to create a clear growth path and a fair ecosystem for our 3P merchants.

In addition to that, we will continue to strengthen user mind share of our 3P offerings. We will see that for our 3P driven categories such as fashion category, users have built growing mind share of shopping for clothing on JD.com. We are committed to developing our platform ecosystem, achieving win-win outcomes with our 3P merchants and better serving our users. Platform Ecosystem business will also be our long-term driver for both revenue growth and profitability expansion.

Xu Ran
CEO & Executive Director

[Interpreted] For your second question, in Q3, JD Retail continued to see steady profit growth. This further validates our confidence in retail's long-term margin trajectory. The main drivers for this include: first, the healthy development of our platform ecosystem will drive growth momentum in our commission and advertising revenues, which will be a contributor to our margin expansion.

Second, as we continue to build up our supply chain advantages and the scale effect of our core retail business, we are confident to further lower cost and improve our operating efficiency, which will lead to better margin performance. To note, JD Retail's gross margin has been expanding year-on-year for 14 consecutive quarters. Third, our category mix shift will also impact our margin performance. Currently, the operating efficiency and margin performance of most of our categories and brands have been improving.

In particular, our supermarket category has built stronger procurement capabilities and differentiated product offerings. We see meaningful potential to further increase supermarkets margins going forward.

Meanwhile, as we continue to optimize the product mix for electronics and home appliances, we also see room to increase these categories margins in the long term. In terms of investments in our new businesses, we will be centered around supply chain capabilities to make investments such as in food delivery, international and Jingxi businesses. As we further enhance our supply, performance and services and broadened coverage in categories, customers and regions, we see more growth potential of our businesses.

As the new initiatives generate deeper synergies with our existing businesses, we expect to see improvements in operating efficiency and profitability of our broader business ecosystem. Finally, our high single-digit margin target for the long term remains unchanged.
