[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.

Joseph Ritchie
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

So let's just -- I'm just going to focus my one question on Gas Power equipment orders. Clearly, incredible momentum in 2025. I think your original expectation was for backlog and for SRAs to be roughly around 60 gigawatts and you ended at 83 gigawatts. Now you have an expectation of 100 gigawatts by the end of 2026. Scott, maybe just talk about just the nature of your discussions. Have they changed at all, types of customers? And then also you did mention that you expected the margin in your backlog to be better as well. So it sounds like the pricing discussions have also been positive.

Scott Strazik
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Joe. I mean on the end of that, I'd say, yes, pricing does continue to strengthen. When we look at where we're trending with our slot reservation agreements today versus our existing backlog, there's another 10 to 20 points of pricing strength in the SRAs today. We are pleased -- you're right, we were talking in the middle of last year at 60 gigawatts and landed at 83 gigawatts because the intensity of the discussions, really late summer, fall, right through the holidays have continued to be very intense. When you think about this year getting to 100 gigawatts by the end of the year, what I would tell you is it's likely going to be a larger proportion of orders. Today, with the 83 gigawatts, it's 40 gigawatts of orders, 43 gigawatts of SRAs, that probably shifts towards more of a 60-40 split with 60% on order over the course of 2026.

And then really the question that we'll have to evaluate and share with you as we go is how many customers are ready to commit to slots today for really '31 to '35. And our 100-gigawatt assumption that we talked about today doesn't really assume a lot of those, let's call it, framework agreements get closed in 2026, but there are active discussions right now and active discussions we're going to keep working. That could take that 60-40 split of 60 gigawatts of orders directionally and 40 gigawatts of SRAs to see the SRA number grow even higher over the course of this year. But it's January and we want to see how those discussions progress.

The next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.

Julian Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Just wanted to circle back to the Gas Power equipment market because I suppose we get a lot of questions from investors around smaller turbine makers looking to grab share, looking to take advantage of the fact that you're trying to be measured on capacity increases and there are very long lead times. And obviously, there was an announcement of someone looking to repurpose ancient narrowbody engines for power gen supply.

So I just wondered, I suppose, 2 things. One was how serious do you think the threat of market share gains from that plethora of smaller players is? And do you think that they could have some negative effects on pricing in the equipment market as their capacity and share gain efforts ramp up in the years ahead?

Scott Strazik
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Julian. I would just reinforce the comment I made before, which is we do see our slot reservation agreements 10 to 20 points higher in price than where we are other backlogs. So we're continuing to gain price as we continue to play this game in gas. Frankly, a lot of the smaller applications are simply enabling more projects to get started because what it's enabling is earlier power that truthfully we can't provide. But then on the back end, as the heavy-duty gas turbines are available, those smaller applications will become the reliability solution on the back of the -- on the heavy-duty gas turbines.

So what we talk about every day is this is about economics and when you're underwriting 20-year business cases, efficiency matters a lot when you're running these units at baseload. So now with humility, we don't really view those smaller units to be competition, but that doesn't mean that's not a good business in the near term. I think those smaller applications could do very good business the next few years. But we also have just as much conviction in the competitiveness and the value proposition our heavy-duty gas turbines are providing. And we'll continue to provide, and we expect to continue to have the attractive share in the market that we have had and will continue to have.

Kenneth Parks
Chief Financial Officer

And Julian, I know you know this, but we obviously play in a piece of that as well, right. So we have aeroderivative units, and I think last year we booked orders for about 63 of those, which was up significantly year-over-year. Because of us playing in that market, it informs those comments that Scott just made, which is we know how the customers are thinking about utilizing that equipment in the midterm.

The next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.

Nigel Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

So my one question is on the backlog margins specifically for Power. So 11 points of improvement year-over-year is really impressive. Maybe just can you talk about the 17 points of improvement since year-end '22? The starting point would have been about a breakeven. I just want to confirm that. And then based on where you're pricing turbines today, would you expect backlog margin to continue improving in 2026?

Scott Strazik
CEO, President & Director

That's fair. That directionally the starting point is approximately breakeven, and most definitely, we expect the margins in equipment backlog in Power to continue to grow at a very healthy clip in '26. And that's why we articulated on the call that we expect to add at least as much equipment margin in backlog in '26, i.e., at least $8 billion this year as we did last year.

Kenneth Parks
Chief Financial Officer

And we get excited about that, not only on the equipment side of it, but if you think about the pricing on the service contract that comes along with a new heavy-duty gas turbine as the pricing is accelerating on the equipment itself, as we sign those new contracts for service orders, we'll see incremental pricing there. So your point is exactly right, we're seeing accretion in margins on the equipment. That also leads to a long life of pricing improvement on the service side of the portfolio.

Scott Strazik
CEO, President & Director

Because when you think about it, everybody, we added about $12 billion of equipment backlog in Power. We added $9 billion of services backlog in Power over the course of the year. Both are experiencing real margin accretion.

The next question comes from Mark Strouse with JPMorgan.

Mark W. Strouse
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Scott, maybe switching gears to the Electrification segment, just kind of stepping back, kind of leading up to the spin. Just kind of the opportunity that you've been talking about, kind of investing in that business to expand it from what it's been over the last decade or so. Obviously, you're clearly making progress with the orders. You talked about kind of record orders in 4Q. To the extent that it's possible, can you just kind of update how much of that do you think is really driven by just kind of the overall market strength versus what GE is doing specifically to gain market share?

Scott Strazik
CEO, President & Director

Well, I mean, Mark, with humility, I would argue that we're able to provide a very unique solution to the end customers today with the linkage of the power generation and the electrical equipment together in a way that it is difficult for many other providers to do. So this isn't simply about drafting on a larger market. I would say that was maybe more of a theme in '23, as the European market started to move post the Ukraine crisis, that supply and demand created an opportunity for us and we took advantage of it. That was a '23 theme. '25 theme is we're providing a differentiated solution. And our ability to link power generation solutions with electrical equipment is positioning us to continue to grow this business on an outsized basis.

So I look at the business and I say $14 billion of revenue in 2026 directionally, we think our addressable market today with the products we sell is directionally $150 billion. So I mean we're at like 10% of our directional market, and there's a lot we can do. Now yes, to earn that, we've got to get better with our operations. And that's why we talked about the fact that from '24 to '28, we're doubling our output with transformers and switch gears. And most of that is coming from more shifts, more investments in how we operate. That helps.

And at the same time, we talked about things like solid-state transformers in December. I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, 2 weeks ago, I saw our first product that's completed. We'll be testing it over the course of the summer before we deliver it to the hyperscaler customer. That could be a substantial order for us with a new product line in 2027 for deliveries later in the decade. So I continue to grow my optimism and frankly my expectations with how material this is as a part of GE Vernova. And we're going to keep leaning into this business.

Kenneth Parks
Chief Financial Officer

And then it's a great opportunity to think about the Prolec acquisition, right, because you talked about what are we able to do not only just from a market, but from a GEV perspective, bringing things together. This was one of the primary reasons that we were so excited about the Prolec acquisition because there were terms and conditions around the arrangement which allowed us to keep things within certain markets. Now that it's totally going to be consolidated by GEV and fully owned by GEV, we're able to optimize where we can have transformers go around the world. So that's a really good thing.

But one of the other opportunities as well is Prolec is a provider of distribution transformers, which are a key part of what's going into data centers. So this opportunity of bringing GEV together and how it's benefiting the Electrification business though it runs right exactly to what Scott says, but it gave me the opportunity to remind everybody what the importance of this Prolec acquisition is.

The next question comes from Alexander Virgo with Evercore ISI.

Alexander Virgo
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Can we stay on Electrification, please? And just integrating Prolec, I'm surprised there hasn't been a little bit more of an accretion on the original margin guidance. So I wondered if you could just talk a little bit about costs to integrate and investment that you might need to do to make sure that you get the benefit of what you've just talked about and think about how that margin profile might look as we look out to the 2028 guidance.

Scott Strazik
CEO, President & Director

I mean Alexander, I'd just start by saying no change from the expectations from Prolec from what we talked about when we closed the deal in October. The reality is we could have a little bit of debate as to whether we wanted to change the margin guide by basis points, to be exact, to where we had framed things up in October. What I would just interpret is this gives us even more opportunity to outperform over the course of '26. I wouldn't overthink that there's been any change in the financial contribution from Prolec in 11 months of, call it, the '26 or, at all, the '28 expectations. Frankly, if anything, we've had a very productive 3 months of integration meetings and are very excited for this to be part of the company on Monday.

The next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.

David Arcaro
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I was wondering if you could touch on the nuclear space. We've seen a lot of momentum on the policy side, deal side in the SMR space. Wondering if you could talk to your project opportunities. Have things accelerated? Could there be opportunities for more SMR deals to come?

Scott Strazik
CEO, President & Director

David, the opportunity is great. The discussions are progressing. What I would say with nuclear may be a little bit different than gas and grid because we're really restarting an industry here in the western world is they're progressing, they're sequential. There's a lot of terms and conditions that are being discussed. We're working very closely with the U.S. administration that is very determined to restart a nuclear industry in the U.S., and we're very motivated to serve them on that path.

We're also having productive conversations in Sweden, in Poland today that we're very optimistic about going forward, but it may take a little while before they translate to announcements. So we're into a new year. We're working hard with a number of both governments and customer archetypes, including the hyperscalers, on what this can mean for them in, let's call it, the first half of the next decade. So opportunity pipeline growing, but the timing to close is going to be a little bit different than the intensity of the close velocity right now with gas and grid.

The next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.

Nicole DeBlase
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Scott, I wanted to get your thoughts on something a bit higher level. A few weeks ago, we had this announcement from Trump kind of pushing for an emergency power auction. I'm really curious about your reaction to that, both with respect to the potential impact on Gas Power demand, the market in the U.S. as well as GEV.

Scott Strazik
CEO, President & Director

There's clearly a need to continue to evolve the market mechanisms to encourage what's needed in this country, which is substantially more new build of firm fixed power generation capacity. Whether that happens through the auction mechanism a few weeks ago announced by the administration allowing hyperscalers to bid into a separate auction for separate PPAs, that's one pathway to do it. Do we probably need in a number of markets a capacity auction mechanism that provides more years of revenue guarantee for more build to happen today? Definitely.

The market's already moving, right? We moved into '25 with 46 gigawatts on contract. We ended the year with 83 gigawatts. We'll end this year with at least 100 gigawatts. So the market is moving regardless, but we are very motivated by continuing to iterate with the administration on how to enable even faster growth and simultaneously thinking our way through on how we'll fulfill if that happens. So motivated by the announcement a few weeks ago, but I'd also emphasize it's early. I think changing policy and how these markets have worked isn't going to happen overnight. But clearly, you can see in our orders book that the market continues to move our way regardless.

The next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with UBS.

Amit Mehrotra
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Just one clarifying question. Can you just update us on what you're sold out through? I think last time it was 2028 on both heavy-duty and aeroderivatives. I mean these backlog numbers are eye popping, so I assume we're going out quite further. And then just one clarification on Electrification. I know you talked about it earlier, but it just seems like the organic growth expectations have maybe come down for '26 when you include Prolec in there relative to the 20% you had last year. Maybe I'm doing my math wrong, but if you could just clarify that point, that'd be helpful.

Kenneth Parks
Chief Financial Officer

Let me do the last part first and then I'll hand it back to Scott. No, the organic growth expectations haven't come down. When we give you the organic growth number, we're giving it to you without Prolec. So just to make that easy, we're saying the organic growth for Electrification and then just add the $3 billion on top of it. So there's been no change in the expectations for Electrification negatively.

Scott Strazik
CEO, President & Director

And they've demonstrated an ability to outperform the last few years with their ramp. Let's see how they do this year. But yes, no change, Amit, from December 9. On the gas capacity, the reality is the 83 gigawatts that we now have on capacity is certainly very heavily playing into '29, but there are slots in '30 and beyond that are also secured. So we do continue to have capacity available today at 83 gigawatts on contract for 2029. That said, by the time we get to 100 gigawatts which we're now projecting by the end of the year that 100 gigawatts directionally will have both '29 and '30 largely sold out based on where we see it today. But sitting here today on January 28, there are still slots available for 2029.

This question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup.

Andrew Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Scott, can you give us more color in your assessment of how your teams are doing on that variable cost productivity that you talk about and what that might mean for the next couple years? Obviously, you reiterated those 22% EBITDA margin targets for '28 in Power and Electrification, still early days on lean. What are you seeing on the ground as you begin to ramp up capacity more significantly? And can you remind us how your contracts are structured for rising commodity costs?

Scott Strazik
CEO, President & Director

Well, the commodity cost, to a large extent, I would say from when we take orders, Andrew, to a large extent, we lock in with the suppliers, the price. So it's generally matched. The only exception to that is with our long-term service contracts and those have material escalators attached with them. So on our $150 billion backlog, we feel very good about our protection for material inflation.

Now on our variable cost productivity journey on where we are, it's a very good and timely question. We'll have our February operating reviews with our business teams next week, and that is the main event or one of our main event. If I assess where we are right now, I would say with a backlog that's grown by 50% in the last 4 years, the team has been making very good progress in our ability to fulfill on that. And that's when we talk about seeing the gas ramp up in the third quarter of '28 -- third quarter '26, excuse me, we'll hit that. Doubling transformers and switch gears '24 to '28, we'll hit that.

Now can we be even more effective with our sourcing leverage here now that we're at this level of scale? And do I have a high degree of expectations that the sourcing productivity will contribute even more to our margin expansion when we show you that chart that we showed you today on backlog in March, 12 months from now? The answer is yes. But there's a maturation process here between investments in the factories for output and fulfillment, feeling very good, somewhat countered with how strategically forward thinking our teams are with sourcing savings that I think we've got a few miles still to go together. That is good news in the sense that it's opportunity and opportunity for us to get better and something I look forward to updating everyone on as we go through that journey together in 2026.

Michael Lapides
Vice President of Investor Relations

Before we wrap up, let me turn it back to Scott for closing comments.

Scott Strazik
CEO, President & Director

Michael, thank you. Everybody, I would just start again with our customers. We are humbled with their confidence in us to drive that $150 billion backlog to the 75,000 employees we have today that I'm proud to represent every day, as is Ken, in these meetings. For everybody on the call, we appreciate your continued interest in GE Vernova and I hope you can hear in our voices both the combination of humility and hunger that we have as we go into a new year that there's a lot of work to do. We're ready to do that work and we look forward to interacting with all of you throughout 2026. Thanks, everyone.
