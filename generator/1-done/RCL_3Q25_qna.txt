[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel.

Steven Wieczynski
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

So Jason, you mentioned that '26 EPS is going to start with the $17 handle, and it seems pretty clear that '26 bookings, demand pricing all look pretty solid at this point. So look, I fully understand you guys aren't prepared to give detailed guidance for next year. But as we think about '26 I would assume your company tagline very much remains in place here, meaning, look, we know capacity growth offset at 6%. Moderate yield growth, I would assume is kind of in that low- to mid-single-digit range and that the disciplined cost control probably means low single-digit growth or in your terms, anemic, even with some of your structural costs you'll be taking on next year. So from a high-level perspective, is that kind of the right way to think about '26?

Jason Liberty
President, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Steve. Yes, I think that is a good high-level way of saying it. I think first, to start off with, it is early in our planning process. And actually, I even said -- I said it earlier to you on CNBC, $17 handle does not mean $17.01. If you take moderate yield growth, you take good cost control or as Naf used the term anemic, which I think is probably a better description of how we think about costs for next year as we are significantly leveraging our scale and leveraging technology and so forth to get more and more efficient each and every day that leads you to sizable earnings per share growth, ROIC growth, et cetera. I think where there's probably a little bit of noise is below the line and probably in fuel. And so there are an increase in our fuel costs that have a compliance component to it.

And then also, as we -- as we're managing global minimum tax, there is a slight increase in the taxes that we're anticipating to play. And that's probably where there's a little bit of a disconnect. The other thing I just want to add is we're also investing a lot in technology. We're investing a lot in these new destinations. We're going from 2 to 8. And so as we bring these things online, there's also depreciation and other things that could potentially come into play. Lastly, I would just add is we're also leveraging to return capital to our shareholders. And you saw that here with the raise in our dividend to $1.

And I think you've also seen that, as talked about in our buyback of shares. And so we are -- our balance sheet is in an incredibly strong position, and we are opportunistically buying back shares, and we're doing that and taking advantage of being able to lever ourselves up to maintain a strong investment-grade position but maintaining that leverage point that we've said to maintain that rating.

So we feel really good about the book position, the rates that we're booking at provide us a lot of rate room and opportunity for next year as we are optimizing our yield profile while we're growing the business at 6% on a capacity basis and bringing on new incredible destination experiences with the Royal Beach Club here in Nassau. So there's a lot of really great and exciting things.

And I would say just last one is that we continue to see a very strong consumer. Our guests are -- their thirst for our brands, for the ships, the destinations and the incredible experiences that our incredible crew are delivering is at the very highest level, and we see that in our Net Promoter Score. So we're super excited about the strength and there was a little bit of noise here in the fourth quarter. There were 3 storms that just one, even in Asia, there's a typhoon in Asia that impacted our -- some of the land-based experience and some of the compensation we needed to give back. But that's not a reflection of the strength that we're seeing.

Our next question will come from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.

Robin Farley
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I also wanted to think a little bit about your 2026 comments. To clarify, when you talk about the anemic net cruise cost growth, is that sort of anemic before, because that would sound like sub-2%. And is that before we think about the impact of the new destinations you're opening? In other words, would that be in addition? Was that anemic referring to sort of like-for-like and then there would be more than that?

And then a similar clarification on the bookings side of things for 2026, it sounds like your price on the books is up year-over-year and maybe booked load is down year-over-year. And I assume that's intentional. Maybe you could just kind of give us some color around that.

Naftali Holtz
Chief Financial Officer

Robin, let me talk about the cost expectations for next year. So in the last couple of years, we're opening and we have plans to open every year private destination, right? So next year is going to be the Paradise Island Beach Club in Nassau. And we have a lot of other initiatives that we're doing. But at the end of the day, the way we manage our costs is we look at -- we were subscribed to our formula. We have the moderate capacity growth, moderate deal growth, strong cost control. We grow capacity next year by 6%. So with all this, we take this into account, and my comments are totally under total amount.

And of course, we have those headwinds. But on the other hand, we have a lot of things that we're doing. We are finding better ways, as I noted in my remarks, to manage the business, deliver the experience. in a more efficient way through technology, just efficiencies and AI. And so the way we manage it is all in a total. And so my comments are on the total cost growth for next year.

Jason Liberty
President, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. So -- and just to put a point on it, Robin, is that the anemic comment includes the structural costs. So it's not just like-for-like. It includes the Royal Beach Club in the Bahamas as well as we leverage AI and we leverage the scale of our business. On the comment -- on your question on the bookings side of things, I think there's a few things to keep into consideration. One, we've obviously -- leveraging our incredible ships and leveraging our private destinations while also considering what different segments that consumers are looking for, we have more short product coming online next year and those guests book closer in.

And so that's a little bit of probably what I would say is the year-over-year comparable on the load factor standpoint, this really is what influences that. We actually think we're in an optimal book position. We're at rates that are, I mean, higher than we probably thought that they would be at, which I think is a really great thing as we see really strong demand and people are dreaming more and more on their vacation experiences. And we're also seeing that translate to onboard spend. And so we're thoughtfully meeting our guests with the experiences and they're willing to pay for that.

Our next question will come from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.

Matthew Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So Jason, maybe could you just elaborate on the progression of global demand that you saw over the course of the third quarter any change in momentum at all that you've seen in October? And maybe to your comment before, just drivers that you see supporting '26 bookings at the high end of historical ranges. And maybe just if you're seeing anything different from new customer acquisition.

Jason Liberty
President, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Sure. So I'll just start off maybe first on the new customer acquisition side. First, our -- all the things that our brands are doing and what we're doing on an enterprise basis, to really kind of build out further our commercial flywheel is really working. So even like the announcement today about Points Choice and making sure that our guests when they choose to sail in any of our brands that they're getting the points that they want on their primary brand that they have loyalty status in.

We continue to evolve things like that. Our technology, our AI tools are getting smarter and smarter so that we're able to curate what is relevant to that consumer. And that's drawing in more new to cruise, really seeing an elevated amount of increase first to brand. So seeing people shift from other cruise lines to our brands, we've seen an elevated amount of that. And then our loyalty program and what we've been doing to add to that is we're just getting more and more reps from that consumer. And so we're really happy about that. When you think about just what we see broadly, really, each of the markets that we're doing business in or that we're sourcing our guests from is doing quite well.

We saw a little bit of a pullback from the North here in Canada in the early kind of mid part of the year, but we've now seen that normalize. Demand from Europe this summer was really strong, and their focus now on booking into 2026 is actually stronger. And the reason for that, when we talk to those guests and our travel partners, is that we didn't have a lot of inventory left in the summer of 2025 for the European consumers that typically book a little bit later. So they're getting a little bit ahead of that curve, and that's really encouraging. And then -- but we -- again, we continue to see the U.S. consumer really across all segments, whether that's our family segment to our ultra-luxury segment. we want you to stay with us and so those demand patterns have been quite strong. What I will say is that as these tools develop, our forecasting is getting better.

And so our ability to predict what's going to happen in a quarter and then close-in is getting better as this kind of marriage between AI and our historical forecasting capabilities is getting closer and closer in terms of its predictability. And so I would not, in any way, take that because we hit the high end of our range in Q3, that's -- we don't guide with the hope of coming out with some incredible beat. We guide because that's our best thinking at a point in time. It's a 50-50 forecast. And that's how we try to manage the business. We've just, I think, all collectively been in an environment where what we would see in the forward-looking picture was greater than what we saw in the previous picture. And we're seeing that, but now we're able to predict it better.

Our next question will come from the line of Lizzie Dove with Goldman Sachs.

Elizabeth Dove
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I just wanted to ask about the Caribbean. There's been a lot of talk about whether there's oversupply in the region as people move more capacity there. You gave that great start about 4Q and it doesn't sound like you're seeing it, but curious what you're seeing there, whether there is oversupply and how you think about the setup for 2026 specifically?

Jason Liberty
President, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. Well, I mean, it's -- I think it's well known. It's been known for some time that there is an increase in supply in the Caribbean, of course, Caribbean has been working incredibly well for us. And so not surprised that there's been a supply increase there. But it's a very manageable increase in supply. So we've seen it -- it's been a little bit more -- a little bit more promotional in the Caribbean activities. But for us, I think, because of our differentiated assets with our ships and our destinations and our ability to kind of keep our guests inside of our ecosystem, and we're seeing a draw from other ecosystems coming to our ecosystem that we're able to not only manage that demand, but we're able to see our guests pay up to experience our delivery.

Our next question will come from the line of Brandt Montour with Barclays.

Brandt Montour
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great. So if you look at your guidance for the fourth quarter net yields and you add back the 90 basis points or so from the comparison issues that you laid out? And then maybe add something for the storms you kind of get to, I don't know, maybe something like mid-3s exiting the year. I just want to know if that's the way you would sort of cleanse the fourth quarter in terms of how yield growth is exiting the year to the lens of the fact that there's not much new hardware helping out there. And so maybe this is what we could look at as a like-for-like exit in the year. But let me know if there's other puts or takes, as we think about building our models for '26.

Naftali Holtz
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I mean, obviously, we're not providing guiding for '26, but we are going to subscribe to the formula, as we just talked about. But in terms of how you exit the fourth quarter, your math is directionally correct. So we did quantify the more -- the less dry docks as well as the new hardware. And so when you take kind of a more normalized new hardware and like-for-like, you're definitely in the ZIP code.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Citi.

James Hardiman
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

So maybe to that last point, as we sort of roll things forward into 2026, I think investors are very keen as we think about puts and takes that there's a lot of puts, right? You've got, whereas in 2025, you had sort of negative ship timing. That was a headwind that now becomes a tailwind. Obviously, weather, it's not a big number, but in theory, that becomes a tailwind as we think about 2026. I guess where I struggle a little bit is to get to anything less than [ $18 ] if I don't assume that yields are, I don't know, less than they were this year as we think about growth. So maybe help us -- are there any takes as we think about the puts and takes specifically, are some of these tailwinds may be offset by a weaker consumer environment broadly, It doesn't really sound like it. We're just trying to sort of put some of these items.

Jason Liberty
President, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. So thanks, James, for the question. I think, first, to start off, is that the consumer or our guests is strong. They have great jobs, they have great balance sheet, bank accounts. And they have a strong desire to vacation and build experiences and memories with their friends and family. But there's -- we're also not immune to what's generally happening in the environment. And so it's what the consumer is willing -- their willingness to pay up, and they are willing to pay up. They may not be willing to pay like last year, double digits up for the year before, I think it was 13% or 14% up but they're willing to pay more. And so I think in your math of yield growth is we expect moderate yield growth for next year.

I would describe like this year was a moderate yield growth type of year, which we had at foreshadowed for a very long period of time. I would say, second, as we said, is our -- we expect our costs to grow on a per APCD basis at an anemic level. So we want to have a healthy margin between our yields and our costs, and that's going to drive more margin to our business, more returns, more cash flow to our shareholders. and gives us the confidence to continue to invest in our business. I think where -- when you're probably trying to reconcile your numbers, I mean, you can certainly -- Blake and team can help you do more of it. I think it's -- more of it is below the line, where I think that there's an opportunity to provide some clarity here.

And again, I just want to stress, I did not say our earnings for next year are going to be $17 I said that they're going to have a $17 handle on there. Just to clarify, again, so I think we feel very good about the business for next year. And it's -- whether we look at our book position or what we're hearing from our guests, we're going to continue to generate very strong demand and deliver these incredible vacation experiences.

Our next question will come from the line of Ben Chaiken with Mizuho.

Benjamin Chaiken

I have a question on River. You mentioned Jason sold out your '27 itineraries in a few hours. I think you have 10 ships in the first order. How are you thinking about allocating capital to this opportunity in the context of what appears to be accretive ROI? Like are there balance sheet limitations? Is there ship construction limitations? Or was it just getting comfortable with the opportunity?

Jason Liberty
President, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Sure. Thanks for the question, Ben. First, it didn't sell out in a few hours and sold out in a few minutes. So to our Head of our Celebrity brand, I told you so. .

Naftali Holtz
Chief Financial Officer

The good news is we're going to have more.

Jason Liberty
President, CEO & Chairman of the Board

That's right. Yes, that's right. Yes. So we -- our initial order was 10. We -- obviously, we have options for much more than all of that. First and foremost, what you want to do is you want to make sure that you get the product right. And so our launch of it and you had the opportunity to see what the ship is going to look like, the amenities that it's going to offer it will deliver on the true DNA of the Royal Caribbean Group, right? It will be a step change and it will change the expectations of what our guests are looking for.

As I also said when we announced this, this is not a hobby. We do expect to be a substantial vacation player in the River business, and so we will continue to grow that. I mean our limitations, I think more is just squaring up that we got the experience on what we want it to be. And then this is an area where we have an opportunity to accelerate into here, and we have confidence in doing that.

Our next question will come from the line of Conor Cunningham with Melius Research.

Conor Cunningham
Melius Research LLC

Maybe just going back to comment and moving to shorter-duration itineraries and as a result, banking on closing yields. I think that a lot of the questions have just been obviously around the yield performance in the next year. But it seems to that mix dynamic is really what's kind of changing your approach to the 2026. So I guess maybe my question is, if close-in demand were to stay here, would that suggest that like the ultimate -- like that you would see significant upside to your underlying earnings upside in 2026. Is that a fair assumption?

Jason Liberty
President, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. So one, I wouldn't say that we are -- you're banking on close-in demand. I would probably describe it as each product that we offer to our guests and they're different segments and different brands and different destinations, has a different booking pattern to it. That's very natural. And I think a weekend getaway is not typically what's on somebody's mind 18 months in advance. And so as we have more of those opportunities that we're able to deliver because of the assets that we have, that is what's driving a change in that behavior.

But the behavior in our other products actually looks very similar to what we -- what we have typically seen for 7 night Caribbean or 7 night in Europe, et cetera. And so those patterns are there. They're strong and they're accelerating. And so I think that's what you want to see is that for each of the product and those different tracks that things are moving at a rate that's going to optimize your total revenue performance.

And so that's how we think about it. Now certainly, we have seen in the past, and we do not count on this, is that you close in on all these products accelerate and we end up beating our expectations. But we do, of course, try to bake in to our forecast. These are the patterns that -- the patterns we saw last quarter, the patterns we saw a year ago try to inform how we expect the track to occur.

It's -- and that's how our yield management works, that's how our tools work and trying to predict and to lay out what we should be offering in the market. So I think, again, we feel very good about the booking environment. We feel good about our book position. I would read into our commentary, is we are optimizing our revenue -- as when we look back in time, we see more often than not that we've left some money on the table, and that's -- it's our job to maximize revenue.

Our next question will come from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.

Sharon Zackfia
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

I wanted to talk through kind of the composition of your revenue as you ramp up more of the owned destination. So I know with CocoCay, you also saw a ticket lift in addition to the onboard spend that you get on the island. Is that a similar dynamic with the Royal Beach Clubs or as the Royal Beach Clubs come on, do we start to see the composition of yield shift a little bit more to onboard spend and how that lead versus ticket?

Michael Bayley
President & CEO of Royal Caribbean International

Sharon, it's Michael. Yes, it's a good question. I mean Perfect Day was -- really was a huge driver of ticket lift as well as onboard spend. I think with the Beach Clubs, it's a slightly different products. So it does kind of slip more into the short excursion onboard revenue frame. And so it's also a driver for itinerary as well because we're beginning to see that itineraries that include the Beach Club as well as Perfect Day seem to be driving even more demand than historically, which has been really strong. So I think we'll see that kind of combination of Beach Clubs really pushed through in onboard revenue and short excursions. And then the Perfect Day is typically a key driver of ticket.

Jason Liberty
President, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. And Sharon, I think just to add on to Michael's point, it's got to modulate a little bit, right? Because the Perfect Day model is -- tends to bring a lot of premium on the ticket side. And so we still have -- there's opportunity for us to grow more in CocoCay, but as Perfect Day Mexico comes online, that is probably a little bit more of a balance between ticket and onboard, when the Beach Clubs come online, it's more on the onboard side. So it will modulate a little bit here. And -- but it's -- the answer to all of it is it's great revenue. It's a great guest experience, great margins, great returns. And so it's a true kind of win-win opportunity for everybody.

Our next question will come from the line of Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research.

Vince Ciepiel
Cleveland Research Company LLC

Just wanted to clarify kind of the yield picture here in '25. The first half was up, I think, closer to 5%. Second half looks on track for 2.5% or maybe something a little bit north of that. Clearly some moving pieces. How much of that decel is related to just tougher compares versus maybe less new hardware tailwind? Is new hardware still a tailwind for the second half on a year-over-year basis? Or has it kind of transitioned to a little bit of headwind. And then the last piece, obviously, is you've called out, I think, some port fees as well as dry dock as well as Haiti, et cetera. So there's a number of like isolated headwinds, but just help us kind of bridge that step down, first half versus the second half, if you could.

Jason Liberty
President, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. And thanks, Vince. So every quarter has something, right, because the ship delivery timing does impact those. These are large ships. And this year, we had 2 deliveries. I think the best way to look at it is you kind of look at it on a yearly basis, and that's -- if you kind of kind of look at it across the board, it's probably -- if you normalize all these quarter-over-quarter things, some of it was at '24, easy comp or a harder comp. And some of it is just some of these events and timing of ship deliveries and how we ramp up.

But if you look at it on a yearly basis, that's a great, I think, just a way to look at our business. And it also subscribes to our formula, which we've said all along, this is how we manage the business. This is how we subscribe to that and then we drive to grow the business according to that formula, including the yield, the capacity and the cost.

Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Didora with Bank of America.

Andrew Didora
BofA Securities, Research Division

Actually, Naf, I just wanted to touch on the bond deal quickly to finance the Celebrity Xcel. Obviously, not a usual way to finance a ship, but certainly makes sense given the rate differential. I guess my question is are you pretty much indifferent in how you finance the ships right now as long as there is that rate benefit? And out of curiosity, are there any additional benefits of tapping the unsecured market as opposed to the ECA financing?

Naftali Holtz
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Great question. Thank you. And so, yes. For now, we're in a place where we have a very strong investment-grade balance sheet. We're benefiting from rates that are basically commensurate with our financial performance and our ratings. And so when we evaluate that, we look at it and we say, what does that make sense to finance with ECA, obviously, they're great partners. We're very grateful to kind of the partnership we have.

It's obviously very important during the construction period to have the financing and these ships will -- they always have that committed financing in place also post delivery, which is obviously very valuable. But when we come to the decision, when we take the ship, we have this alternative -- and for this one, we negotiated this financing several years ago when credit rating was not as good as today. And so we -- and our improvement in the capital markets was quite substantial.

And so when we looked at that, it just made more sense and much lower cost of capital. The other thing is just to remind everybody is these ECAs also have amortization payments. So when you look at the average tenure, of the loan is roughly a little bit over 6 years. We're obviously now issuing 10-year piece of paper in the unsecured market. So it's not just that the cost is low, we also gain tenure with it. And obviously, the covenant package is a little bit different, too. So you have the benefit there. We're very happy with kind of how this went. We're going to continue to evaluate all the alternatives -- it's very important to understand that all our ship financing -- all our ship deliveries and orders will have committed financing going forward, and then we'll have that option to evaluate what's the best alternative for us when we take delivery.
