Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Thank you, management. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Chee from Morgan Stanley.

Dan Chee
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

[Foreign Language]. Could the management share the RevPAR trend since October? And also, if it's possible, can you provide your outlook for RevPAR in the fourth quarter and also potentially next year?

Haijun Wang
Founder, Chairman of Board of Directors & CEO

[Interpreted] Thank you, Dan. Let me address your question. Since the beginning of this year, with the continued recovery in industry supply and demand dynamics, we sticked to a high-quality development and leveraged a refined strategy of revenue management, demonstrating strong operational resilience. Throughout the first 3 quarters of this year, our RevPAR has shown a trend of progressive improvement on a year-over-year basis.

During the National Day holiday, leisure travel demand remained robust, but the market exhibited some significant structural divergence. Driven by stronger ADR, our RevPAR achieved year-on-year growth. After the holiday, the market returned to a business-dominated environment, but benefiting from active exhibitions and business travel activities, the demand in core cities demonstrated strong resilience. Therefore, we expect the pressure from the year-on-year decline in RevPAR to further ease in the fourth quarter.

Looking ahead, the market will continue to show divergence. With still some challenges and uncertainties remaining, we will continue to deeply understand user needs, strengthen our foundational capabilities, attract users with high-quality hotel products and differentiated experiences. By forging deeper emotional ties with them, we will secure long-term advantages in a volatile market environment and demonstrate our resilience for development.

Next question comes from Sijie Lin of CICC.

Sijie Lin
China International Capital Corporation Limited, Research Division

[Foreign Language]. Could you please share more about the recent new hotel signing trends and whether there are any changes to the full year hotel opening and closure targets?

Haijun Wang
Founder, Chairman of Board of Directors & CEO

[Interpreted] Thank you, Sijie. Let me answer your question. In recent years, we found that during our scale expansion, Atour has consistently maintained our strategic focus on premier hotels, concentrating on core locations for expansion, and we strictly controlled quality. At the same time, we have launched several new hotel products that align with market needs. With the successful launch of many high-quality projects, our brand strength and the differentiated competitive advantages have been further solidified. So we do not endorse a growth strategy driven purely by scale. We firmly believe that only by advancing scale growth on the foundation of quality can we achieve sustainable value.

Regarding signings, as we mentioned earlier, we maintain a strict selection mechanism, focusing on expansion in core business districts of key cities. With high quality being a prerequisite, the total number of new hotel signings this year is generally in line with last year, maintaining a steady development pace. At the same time, we are also clearing stock projects in the pipeline in an orderly fashion to promote the healthy development of our pipeline.

In terms of openings and closures, we opened 152 hotels in the third quarter. We have full confidence in achieving the full year guidance of 500 new openings and reaching our strategic target of 2,000 premier hotels by the end of this year. Meanwhile, for the operating hotels of ours, we place great emphasis on operational quality and user experience. By strengthening standard implementation and refined management, we can ensure that every hotel can deliver consistently high-quality service. To this end, we maintain a certain proactive replacement rate to continuously enhance the quality of our overall hotel network. In the third quarter, we closed 28 hotels and expect approximately 80 closures entirely for this year.

Next question comes from Chen Xin of UBS.

Xin Chen
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

[Foreign Language]. This is Chen Xin from UBS. And my question is about the retail business. Could the management share your perspective on the competition in the retail business? In addition, given the consistent overperformance of the retail business, would you consider any adjustments to your full year retail revenue guidance?

Haijun Wang
Founder, Chairman of Board of Directors & CEO

[Interpreted] Thank you, Chen Xin. Let me start by sharing the development strategy of ours and the competitive landscape of our retail business. Since Atour Planet entered the sleep industry, our brand and product power have gradually gained market recognition. This has been followed by a rise in imitators and industry participants, leading to an increasingly fierce competition. However, we always believe that the real competition is not about the peers, but is about the ever-evolving user needs.

To address this, we did not simply follow the existing industry path. Instead, we progressively built our products and supply chain system with our distinctive characteristics. For example, we officially launched the Atour Planet Deep Sleep Standard recently. This standard differs from traditional industry metrics like fabric weights or thread counts, but it is based on sensory science and the natural rhythms of human sleep, focusing on 2 core sensory indicators of sleeping users, the fluctuation of pressure and the change of temperature. This standard also places higher demand on our product development and production. We aim to continuously strengthen our product barriers through this forward-looking standard while collaborating with the upstream supplier partners to jointly lead the industry progresses.

As a relatively new player in the industry, we always plan our layout with a longer-term mindset. While developing quite rapidly, we have been constantly building and consolidating our foundational capabilities. I believe our underlying philosophy is consistent between the retail and hotel businesses, which is to always prioritize quality over scale. Moving forward, Atour Planet will continue to strengthen our product power, remain user-centric, focus on the systematic development of our long-term capabilities and practice towards group's long-termism development path.

Well, let me address your question about our retail revenue. During the Double Eleven period, Atour Planet delivered outstanding performance and continuously strengthened our brand presence in the minds of users. Based upon our strong performance in Q3 and the Double Eleven, we are now raising our full year retail revenue growth outlook to at least 65% year-on-year and accordingly, adjust the group's full year revenue guidance to a growth of 35% year-on-year.

Next question comes from Ronald Leung of Bank of America.

Ronald Leung
BofA Securities, Research Division

[Foreign Language]. Let me translate my question into English. So we noticed Atour has announced the second dividend distribution plan this year. Could management provide an update on the planning and progress regarding shareholder returns?

Haijun Wang
Founder, Chairman of Board of Directors & CEO

[Interpreted] Thank you, Ronald. Regarding dividends, as we announced today, our second dividend distribution this year amounts to approximately USD 50 million, representing about 29% of last year's net income. Consequently, the cumulative dividend total for this year reaches about USD 108 million, accounting for approximately 62% of the prior fiscal year's net income, exceeding our commitment of no less than 50% of that. Additionally, we formally commenced our share repurchase program in September, and we'll continue to execute them in accordance with our established 3-year plan.

Looking ahead, we will continue to implement our comprehensive shareholder return program, combining dividends and repurchases, targeting a payout ratio of 100% based upon the previous fiscal year's GAAP net income, with the specific implementation pace to be dynamically arranged in line with our business development and capital planning. Through these tangible actions, we are committed to creating long-term value and sharing the success of the company with our shareholders in appreciation of your ongoing support and trust.

The next question comes from Lydia Ling of Citi.

Lydia Ling
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

[Foreign Language]. I'm Lydia from Citi. We noticed the strong operational performance for the Atour Light in the third quarter. So could you share your plan for the Atour Light in the next steps? And any plan for accelerating the store expansion?

Haijun Wang
Founder, Chairman of Board of Directors & CEO

[Interpreted] Thank you, Lydia. Well, yes, indeed, in the third quarter, the RevPAR of operating Atour Light Series 3 hotels surpassed the level from the same period last year, performing pretty decently. And in fact, since the beginning of this year, Atour Light has achieved notable results in brand building, operational efficiency, user experience with both operational performance and scale growth meeting our expectations.

We always believe that the core of a brand lies in its products. The Atour Light Hotel product accurately aligns with the needs and aesthetic preferences of today's young users. The newly launched Atour Light 3.3 with its constantly optimized investment model achieved a better balance between service experience and operational efficiency. Through the implementation of the first batch of our Atour Light 3.3 project, we are constantly gathering feedback from various sites, refining product details and strengthening our differentiated competitive advantage in the midscale market. We expect the scale of Atour Light Series 3 hotels in operation will be reaching 170 to 180 by the end of this year.

We are firmly optimistic about the long-term development of Atour Light. At this current early stage of the brand development, we are particularly focused on solidifying the operational foundation and our systematic capabilities. As for our next step, we will systematically build a dedicated operational system for Atour Light, strengthening its differentiated positioning in all aspects, including from brand concept to service delivery. This will not only distinguish it from our main Atour hotel brand, but also highlight the unique value in the midscale hotel market. On this basis, we will steadily advance towards a longer-term development goal of hitting 1,000 hotels milestone for Atour Light brand. Thank you.
