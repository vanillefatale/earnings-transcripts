Our first question will come from the line of Gregory Peters with Raymond James.

Charles Peters
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

I guess starting just at the high level. I know in the past, you've talked about sort of what do you think the Specialty Insurance target combined ratios should look like over a course of a year. And I guess in the context of understanding those moving pieces, can you kind of provide us some perspective of how you think the budgeting is coming along, and where you think the combined ratio targets might be for 2026?

Craig Smiddy
President, CEO & Director

Sure, Greg. Yes. So ending the year at a combined ratio in Specialty of 93.2% feels pretty good to us. We're hopefully, over time, be a bit better than that. But I think where we're at in the P&C cycle, that feels pretty good. And relative to next year, our plan is to produce something around the same level.

It depends by -- we have 20 different operating companies. Depending on the operating company, that varies. If it's longer tail lines of business, it might be a little bit higher. If it's shorter tail lines of business, it's probably lower. So all the businesses have a unique plan, and they have targets that they set relative to those plans. So I would say 2026, we're looking for a very consistent year. Obviously, there's talk of pricing pressure in the marketplace. But we're going to maintain our discipline.

As I mentioned in my opening comments, we're keenly focused on pricing discipline, underwriting discipline. Every company is focused on combined ratio over top line. And even in our incentive compensation plans, when we have soft pockets of business where pricing is too aggressive in the marketplace, we will remove any kind of growth or retention goal and make compensation based on -- strictly on combined ratio. So it's all about bottom line for us, and that's really driven by the combined ratio.

And I guess the other two questions I had on the Specialty Insurance side, One is just going back to just some more background and what led to the higher loss pick? Because you said it wasn't reflected in -- yet, in the paid claim data. So I'm just curious what you're seeing, and I do recognize your approach to case and loss -- case reserves and loss picks.

So -- and then the other question I had just -- so we just get a model on the table there for you is, I think, Frank mentioned a credit loss on one of the large deductible programs. Just some background on that as well.

Craig Smiddy
President, CEO & Director

Sure, Greg. I'll take both of those. Yes. So we start the beginning of the year with what we believe to be a conservative loss pick. And from there, as we go through each week, we study what's happening with case reserves, and also what's happening with paid losses. And we take those into consideration and look at what trend we think that, that implies. We take a close look at severity. We take a close look at frequency and come up with an overall trend.

So what we saw in commercial auto this year, for the better part of the year was trends. We said, I think, on prior calls, we were seeing trends in the low teens and that we were obtaining rate increases that we're at least commensurate with those trends, and that was the case. As we got towards the end of the year, while we did not notice any paid claim difference, we did notice that case reserves were higher.

And as we communicate, we're conservative. And if we see case reserves at a higher level, we'll react. We did that, I think, a couple of years ago. Same exact thing where trends, all of a sudden moved a bit higher than what we were seeing earlier in the year. And as such, trends now look to be rather than in the low teens, the mid-teens. And as such, the 3 percentage point increase to the accident year loss ratio. We'd rather be conservative and go with what we're seeing in case reserves, as opposed to being relaxed and relying on paid losses.

So I'd just point out, it's not something we missed. It's -- and to give everyone a little more color around that, loss trends move. They're volatile. We follow them regularly, like daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly. And it's always a moving target. It's impossible to instantaneously know what today or tomorrow's loss trend is. No one has a crystal ball. And the best anyone can do is make a projection based on current observations.

And that's exactly what we do. We make a projection based on what we're seeing, and it's usually a conservative projection. In this case, a conservative projection around what we're -- what we saw in the movement between case reserves in the beginning of the year as opposed to case reserves more toward the end of the year.

And just to underscore this a little bit more when I make the statement that it's impossible to precisely and instantaneously know what your trend is going to be, it takes time from the first notice of loss to the time that an adjuster is able to set ultimate case reserves. At the time of first notice of loss, the ultimate number of bodily injuries, the severity of the injuries, whether or not there's attorney representation. Those are all things that are not usually immediately known, and it takes time for that to play out. And that's why it's impossible to instantaneously know what your severity is until you get that kind of information and the year progresses and it comes through in your case reserves.

So hopefully, that provides a little more color around what we saw, how we reacted. And it's really 100% consistent with what we've communicated to all of our investors and analysts. When we observe higher loss trends, we immediately react by adjusting the loss ratio. And as you saw in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned in my comments, we immediately react with rate and rate increases in commercial auto accelerated in the fourth quarter and now are upwards of 16% compared to -- I think we were at 14% last quarter. So -- and we'll keep doing exactly that.

So I'll move on to your second question regarding the $17.5 million offset we had on workers' comp favorable development. And that came from -- as we said in the release, a large deductible program where the losses from prior years had developed. And in this case, there was a credit risk exposure. So we ended up with insufficient collateral, and on large deductible programs when that happens, that's something that then falls to us. And accordingly, we have to put up the reserves ourselves. So that's what happened in this quarter.

And you've been following us long enough to know that those kind of losses are somewhat unique. And certainly in our 45-year history, that's a pretty big number for us relative to past experience. And 99 out of 100 times, we have enough collateral to take care of things, even if losses do develop unfavorably in prior years. But in this one instance, there was insufficient collateral.

Charles Peters
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Well, that's excellent detail. So it's appreciated. Mindful that others might be asking questions. So I'll just close out. Carolyn, if you could just provide your crystal ball view on what 2026 might look for the Title business. I feel like your pick might be as good as anybody's out there. So just curious about your perspective on that.

Carolyn Monroe
President

Sure. In all of kind of the research that we do from people that report on that, it's still showing that commercial should have about a 15% to 20% improvement over this year, which was a wonderful year for commercial. But they see a single-digit increase in residential for next year, less than 10%. So somewhere -- there's -- it goes between 3% and 7% depending on who you look at. So I think it's going to be another year like this year, with some improvement, especially if commercial does improve like it did. So we're looking forward to 2026.

Charles Peters
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

When you say next year, both you and Craig, I presume you mean '26.

Carolyn Monroe
President

Yes, I do.

Craig Smiddy
President, CEO & Director

Right. Right. Yes. We're stuck with the fourth quarter full year '25 mode right now.

Our next question will come from the line of Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler.

Jon Paul Newsome
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Maybe just a follow-up on the case reserves, and I apologize if I missed this because I had a little technical issues myself during the call. The case reserve increases, were there any sort of geographic or patterns within the case reserves that stood out, or would suggest other than just pure sort of overall loss trend that might give us a hint as to what might be happening under the hood?

Craig Smiddy
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Paul, that's a great question. The one -- and we've looked at it in great detail. I can't say geographically, there's anything we've detected. But there are a few things we do know. And that is that the number of people making bodily injury claims relative to the number of accidents that we have is higher. And the percentage of bodily injury claims with attorney representation is higher. And the percentage of claims that end up in litigation in our -- is higher as well.

So a bit of an opinion section here. And that is -- our view is that litigation system abuse is accounting for these increases. And that includes the ongoing proliferation of attorney advertising where plaintiff attorneys are attempting to vilify insurance companies and you only need to turn on the television, or drive down the interstate and see the billboards. And it's amazing. The number of advertisements on television, on billboards, is just continuing to proliferate.

And to us, it's clear that plaintiff attorneys have come to the conclusion that there's a return on these investments. So I think there's industry studies out there from some good industry associations that we're part of and they are coming to the same conclusion.

So those are the only observations. Again, if you have an accident, and you have a property damage claim. We track both bodily injury and property damage, third-party property damage separately. Third-party property damage frequency isn't going up. But bodily injury frequency is going up. Well, how can that be other than just more people willing to make bodily injury claims. And so, again, it comes back to the only conclusion that we can come to is that this litigation system abuse and proliferation of attorney advertising continues to rear its head, and we'll have to see where it goes. But that is what we would attribute a good portion of this, too.

Jon Paul Newsome
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Were the trends any different? Like I know you cited long-haul trucking, Were the trends any different in other portions of what you do in commercial auto? Obviously, trucking is your big piece, but I think you do some other stuff as well. Was it just consistent across anything you had to do with commercial auto?

Craig Smiddy
President, CEO & Director

Another great question because on our other commercial auto, other than long-haul trucking, the trends are there, but they're not as pronounced as they are on long-haul trucking. I think coming back to litigation abuse, a lot of these plaintiff attorneys try to target insurance -- trucking companies and vilify insurance trucking companies and insurance companies. And usually, trucking -- long-haul trucking, in particular, has larger limit policies and plaintiff attorneys know that. So there's more of a target on their back, so to speak. So there is a little bit more rearing its head on long-haul trucking as opposed to other commercial auto.

Jon Paul Newsome
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

So I know in the past, you've been -- this would be my last question, [ if you ] ask it. I know in the past, you guys have been very disciplined about hitting a loss trend with rate. And I'm going to assume that that's the plan prospectively as well. Are there other things that you're considering in terms of reacting to the loss trend change in terms of condition, or areas or anything else sort of non-rate actions? Or is this going to be just a matter of hit it with rate at whatever you think is happening from a loss trend perspective?

Craig Smiddy
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So we are -- out of all of our 20 companies, our most sophisticated data and analytics area is within our long-haul trucking company. And we slice and dice the data and analytics in a very robust and sophisticated fashion, which helps us with targeting rate to those customers that elevate higher propensity for loss. And so part of that is risk selection as well.

It helps us with risk selection and being able to not broad brush rate, but target rate to the insureds that require more rate. And then also continually refine our risk selection so that we're selecting what we think are the best risks and making it very punitive, or not providing quotes at all to those risks that we deem too high.

With respect to terms and conditions. There's not -- there's -- while in other of our businesses, terms and conditions are key -- really key to the business, the Specialty business they're in. Long-haul trucking, there's not a lot you can do with terms and condition on commercial auto. So I wouldn't say that there's a lot we're doing with terms and conditions. But we react with rate. We make sure our overall portfolio rate increase is reflective of the trends that we're observing.

And we -- when I answered Greg's question, I explained that understanding what the trend is, is not instantaneous, but we use a conservative approach. We assume trend is going to -- if it's going up, we assume it's going to continue to either be where it's at or continue to go up. And until we have clear evidence it's going down, we're not adjusting rates downward. We adjust the rates upward. And just in 1 quarter, 200 or 300 basis points, and we'll have to keep our foot on the pedal on that, assuming that we -- our goal is to stay ahead of trend, which we will continue to do.

I would also just point out that as far as what this means for 2026, because we do that, our expectations for 2026 are not different from where we're at now with respect to loss ratio. We assume we're going to keep up with trend. You may recall from a couple of years ago, we had similar kinds of observations back at the end of 2023. And we -- for the fourth quarter of 2023, we bumped up that accident year loss pick. And if you look at how that year has played out, you can look at the financial supplement, things after 2023 were -- remained pretty steady. And into '24 and '25 with 72% loss ratios, following a 71.5% loss ratio in '23. So we would expect the same to happen here again. We're not changing our view on how 2026 looks.

Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Gregory Peters with Raymond James.

Charles Peters
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

One of the things I just wanted to touch upon, this is to close out the capital position of the company. I mean, you've been -- your record of special dividends alongside your regular dividends is pretty interesting. And I'm just curious how you view, in light of the $2.50 dividend that I guess, is paid out and -- was paid out already in January. How you view the capital of the company at this point in time? And what are the metrics we should be watching for to determine whether there's still excess capital, et cetera?

Craig Smiddy
President, CEO & Director

Sure, Greg. I'll be happy to do that. So part of our regular planning cycle is to head into our February Board meetings and present our plan for 2026, which includes a complete analysis of our capital position and our projected capital position. We still think we have plenty of capital. So we think that will put us in a position to, again, recommend to the Board a regular dividend increase, somewhere in line with what we've been doing over the last couple of years.

And in the meantime, we also have $850 million still remaining on our share repurchase program, and we'll put that to work. Especially when there's opportunity, we said all along that we like having both tools in our tool chest, the share repurchase tool as well as the special dividend and regular dividend tool. And to the extent that we think there's a buying opportunity, we said we'll be opportunistic. And to the extent that markets react or overreact, it gives us a buying opportunity to repurchase more shares.

So we have that $850 million. We believe that if the opportunity presented itself, we could put most of that to good use throughout the year, and we would do that. And then as we get further along in the year, again, take a look at where we're at with that capital position, what we've been able to do with share repurchases. And if we -- as we did at the end of last year in December, if we think we are ending the year with more capital, again, we'll reset it with a special dividend.

This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will hand the call back to management for any closing comments.

Craig Smiddy
President, CEO & Director

Okay. Well, thank you. We appreciate the Q&A. We appreciate the opportunity to share our prepared remarks in addition to the earnings release and wrap up 2025 for the year. It was another very good solid year. And we think we're set up for a very good '26. We realize market conditions are in question, but we'll focus on bottom line and profitability and continue with our underwriting excellence initiatives and our pricing discipline and continue to produce growth, particularly as our new Specialty operating companies are producing more and more premium. And we feel very good about where we're heading in '26. So thank you all for your interest and participation, and we will talk to you all again next quarter. Thank you.
