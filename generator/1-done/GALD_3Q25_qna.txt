Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And now we're going to take our first question. And it comes to the line of Thibault Boutherin from Morgan Stanley.

Thibault Boutherin
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

A question is just on Nemluvio for the rest of the year. When we triangulate your comments on the business trends in Q4, it's clear to us that Nemluvio is the biggest moving part in the guidance. So if you could just tell us where you see the most viability here, is it the uptake in atopic dermatitis in the U.S.? Is it the excess uptake? Any sort of help you can give us on where you see the moving parts for Nemluvio in Q4 would be helpful.

Flemming Ornskov
CEO & Director

Yes. I don't know if I agree with your analytics, First of all, thanks for the question. It's USD 263 million so far. You can see we have reported USD 3.737 billion. If I can do the math, that's not the majority. We had double-digit growth in injectable aesthetics. We have double-digit growth in therapeutic dermatology. We had 8.2% growth in dermatological skincare. So I think we have to be a little bit careful not to think that this is about Nemluvio. Nemluvio is in a very early stage of its trajectory. It's performing or outperforming any benchmark we've set.

We're at 7.2%, I think, share at this stage. If you look at NBRx for the AD market, and we're at 37%, if you look at PN, we are now north of 80% commercial coverage and next year, we'll enter most likely into the Medicare and Medicaid. But we have a lot of other things that are growing incredibly fast, and Nemluvio is important, but it's not the only thing. And if I think about the contributions of Cetaphil international. If I think about the contribution already of Relfydess, if I see the very strong performance of Dysport around the world, I think it was a little bit -- we need to moderate that sentiment.

Operator

Any further questions, Thibault?

Thibault Boutherin
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes. No. I mean, I think the question was just on the moving parts in Q4 in particular, but that's fine. Thank you.

Flemming Ornskov
CEO & Director

Yes. We don't manage the company with just one compound. We have -- we ship the resources. And I think we've seen -- we have brought growth in international and in the U.S., 17.5% growth in the U.S. 12-plus percent in international. And if you look at the portfolio, it's almost all products that are showing incredibly strong growth, not just Nemluvio.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And the question comes line of Harry Sefton from UBS.

Harry Sefton

So in fillers and biostimulators, we saw another strong quarter against the backdrop of a weak, HA filler market. Should we think about the vast majority of that growth being driven by Sculptra? And how should we think about the growth going into 2026 for Sculptra given the push into GLP-1 patients do you think you'll be able to accelerate the growth of Sculptra next year? And then also thinking about Restylane growth going into next year given the launch of skin boosters in the U.S., and a couple of other SKUs?

Flemming Ornskov
CEO & Director

No, a very insightful question. Thanks very much. Yes, sometimes one get lost in the minutia details. If you take a step back, your strategic comment is totally right. Over time, in the combined category of fillers and biostimulators. Sculptra, the biostimulator part is approaching half and will probably overtake it sometime next year. What we are seeing, but these are early signs. You should talk to all our competition. Is there a flattening on the negative trend with fillers, yes or no, your insights may be as good as ours. What we are seeing is that if you launch new and innovative fillers like what we've seen with Restylane SHAYPE, we have uptakes that matches some of the best launches like Restylane Kysse, Restylane Lift, we've had -- so I think it's a bit of a mixed bag. There's pricing pressure. There's commoditization.

But if you bring innovation to the market, you see that the unique advantage for us in one of the largest markets, we're going to be launching, I think, up to 6 new products, several of them being fillers next year. In the U.S., if all goes well. We are in the final stage of regulatory approvals for those. So that should give us a boost. But it is quite clear that the trend among consumers is yes, we all want a neuromodulator and now we also want a biostimulatory product. And then we add on a filler. But for treatment of some of the effects of significant weight loss with GLP-1s, you will need both a filler ad biostimulatory product. It's early days to say -- our growth is driving in certain parts of the world, if you go to the Middle East, it's a significant part, in the U.S., it's still early days.

Thomas J. Dittrich
Chief Financial Officer

And then I would only add when you -- and you asked about '26, and we're not going to comment on '26, Harry. But on the longer-term, when you think about the biostimulator opportunity, remember, we just launched in China and the biostimulator opportunity longer-term in China is so big. It's bigger than most -- the sizes of most injectable aesthetics markets in JPAC. So that's why we just start -- launched and then together with Flemming's comments, think of the longer-term secular trend that we have here, and that's really big and amazing.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And the next question comes from the line of Shyam Kotadia from Goldman Sachs.

Shyam Kotadia
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

A quick one on Nemluvio. So in terms of the guidance going forward, you mentioned in the prior results that you're going to consider your greater than $2 billion peak sales guide for the drug. So given the ramp continues to be strong, do you have any update from that perspective? And also any update in terms of the breakeven assumptions, which I believe previously were 2027 and also your assumption to hit blockbuster run rate was also 2027. So any update in regards to that would be super helpful.

Flemming Ornskov
CEO & Director

Yes. I don't think at this stage, we're going to give guidance on Nemluvio apart from what we've already said, it's $2 billion plus. When we look at the data, the uptake continues to be very strong. I think part of the success with the launch so far is we keep the head to the ground, and we focus on building out the sales force, making sure we get access, making sure we do well against that very tough competitive set and that we get as many doctors to experience the product so that they also can prescribe it to more patients. The -- there's a lot of change going on. We used to be mainly dependent on PN. Now we see that AD is a larger part in the third quarter. That was the largest part. So net-net, of course, with this strong uptick, if it continues to that way, we will, at some point, consider resetting the guidance for peak sales and, of course, also the profitability threshold guidance.

Thomas J. Dittrich
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And on the profitability, I mean, let me just comment there on 2025 because this is the Q3 2025 call. Recall that we said that we expected in the H1 call we expected the adverse P&L impact from Nemluvio launch investments and other investments to be 60% in H1 and 40% in H2. Let me update that here with by saying that in H1, we have seen 75% of the adverse P&L impact, and it will be only 25% in H2, driven by the strong uptick. But also remember, strong uptake doesn't happen by itself. You need to reinvest some of those proceeds to make it happen in the following period. And that's what we have done very judiciously. So therefore, driving the strong uptake will bring the breakeven point in -- at a later stage when it's appropriate time. But we're on a very good trajectory here as you see also from a profitability standpoint.

Shyam Kotadia
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Very, very sorry. It broke up a little bit when you said it will bring the breakeven point as -- can you just repeat that lastly on the breakeven point?

Thomas J. Dittrich
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. It will bring breakeven point in because the strong uptake delivers additional profitability. But we don't want to comment on that right now. We said it back today it's sometime in '27. So let's not get into any details. We will do that at the appropriate point in time.

[Operator Instructions] And the next question comes from the line of Benjamin Jackson from Jefferies.

Benjamin Jackson
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. Thank You for the question. One on Relfydess, if I may. I think you've spoken fairly positively about it for a number of quarters now and the ongoing launches. But is there perhaps any more depth in the color that you can provide to us even around the relative size in terms of the entire neuromodulator number that you're putting out? And then thinking about your strategy and how you launch it, is there more color you can provide about the uptake, but also how you balance the commercialization process between Dysport and Relfydess and then how that matters for the U.S. too?

Flemming Ornskov
CEO & Director

Yes. I think you have to take the background here. Since 2019, when we as a team took over, we have shown incredible growth of Dysport around the globe. So of course, we continue to support Dysport. It's an incredibly strong product. It competes well against BOTOX. We are launching it even in more and more countries. So for us, that's the most important product we have right now. We are now launching another product and the way we've launched that is we know that in the neuromodulator space, there are still...

[Technical Difficulty]

Benjamin Jackson
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I'm not sure I caught any -- like three quarters of that due to the line breaking up. I don't know whether you could repeat it at all. Sorry about that. I'm not sure if it's just me.

Flemming Ornskov
CEO & Director

Sorry about that. Yes. So we're really sorry about that. We seem to have some technical issues today.

[Technical Difficulty]

Operator

Yes. Please continue.

Flemming Ornskov
CEO & Director

Okay. Good. Okay. So I apologize. Strong results, not so strong technical execution today. So I apologize for that. But do you want me to repeat the -- sorry, it was a bit long, but I'm happy to repeat it. Is that what you would like me to do?

Benjamin Jackson
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Please, that'll be really useful if so, thank you.

Flemming Ornskov
CEO & Director

I really apologize for these technical issues. So what I was saying is that the way we -- since 2019 have basically been strengthening the commercial execution for Dysport. I think the way we've gained market share. In some cases, we've gained leadership. It's a very strong product. I think you see in most geographies, including the U.S., we continue to gain significant market share also against BOTOX. So when we had the opportunity to launch Relfydess initially in some European countries, the focus was, of course, to maintain the strong momentum of Dysport. We know that there is room for additional optionality among doctors and patients. Relfydess offers certain benefits, of course, fast onset, it's liquid duration. And the doctors that have started using Relfydess, we see that they continue to have a strong preference for that, but we still need to keep in mind that the vast majority of our sales today is Dysport.

So what our key strategy is to continue to drive our overall share of the neuromodulator market and given we're now #1 in Europe, #1 in Australia, #1 in Brazil, honing in on the U.S. I think the strategy is working. And remember, our play in injectable aesthetics is a portfolio play. We have multiple opportunities for you to use fillers under the Restylane name, we have Sculptra. And now in many countries, we have 2 options for you if you want to use a neuromodulator. And we think one of the core strength of our gaining market share and holding in on leadership in aesthetics is because we have a broad portfolio approach.

[Operator Instructions] And then the question comes from line of Yihan Li from Barclays.

Yihan Li
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Yihan Li from Barclays. Congrats on the on the quarter. I guess I have a question on Nemluvio treatment dynamics. So I acknowledge nemo's launch is still at a very early stage. But I'm still wondering what is the average treatment duration so far in PN and also AD indication separately? So based on our research, it seems like the switch out rate for from Nemluvio remains at a very low level, but slightly increased a little bit in the third quarter versus second quarter. So just curious, any observations on discontinuation rate or like patient experiences so far?

Flemming Ornskov
CEO & Director

Yes. There's one advantage of being the CEO and a physician is I interact with a lot of physicians. I just spent time yesterday with 2 of them. So they both have a very large number of patients on the product and I go together with my colleagues on many field visits. So what you're observing is also what we hear back from the physicians, and we're seeing in the market research, the dropout rate has been really low. We still see that every 4 week is the preferred duration, but we are now seeing the doctors and stable patients that have been itch-free slept well at night, that they're now thinking about going or have already started to go to every 8 weeks, which they see as a huge advantage. So what we're seeing is that the initial feedback from patients and physicians has been reconfirming the fast itch-release. It's reconfirmed the very positive impact on sleep and quality of life.

It also has been surprising for many physicians that they feel that the skin clearance is above what their expectations. They had strong expectations in PN, but maybe not so in AD, and they are in the patients they select to be on the product. So the fact that we also can be used first line, the fact that we have a very large portion of our patients being biological naive. It all probably speaks to the fact that for the moment, along with incredibly strong access, 80-plus percent in commercial plans, we see low dropout rates. Of course, like any IL-13 and IL-31, it's not going to be for everyone. The physicians have choices to make but the good news is a lot of physicians are starting to use Nemluvio as first-line given its safety profile, given what the fast itch relief but it's way too early to comment on that. And we just basically started to launch in certain parts of the world. We're building out the field force. We've just launched DTC. So it's way too early at this stage to make big bold projections on the brand.

Thomas J. Dittrich
Chief Financial Officer

The other part that helps a lot is the tolerability. Flemming mentioned the lack of side effects, so to speak. But the other part is just that it doesn't seem to sting as much because it's against the main competitor from a large French company. The volume is much, much lower. It's about a quarter. So therefore, the convenience of having to auto inject yourself. And that's also practice that physicians tell us that help people wanting to stay on the ground because it's just convenient. It's highly tolerable. It doesn't hurt as much. So that's some of the learnings we're getting there. Just complementing Flemming's comments.

Flemming Ornskov
CEO & Director

But the most important is to realize, we're on a journey. We're basically well into the larger PN. We're basically now starting significantly the launch of AD. When you speak to physicians and what we see in market research, that the ones that started to use Nemluvio, particularly in PN initially, they had a lineup of patients that had been difficult to treat for them with other products that didn't want the JAK. So we probably got a pretty severe group of patients initially. Now we're moving into, I think, a broader group of patients and also first line in many cases. So we'll see where that takes us.

[Operator Instructions] And the next question comes from the line of Victor Floch from BNP Paribas Exane.

Victor Floch
BNP Paribas Exane, Research Division

My question is on Relfydess, and I was wondering if you could comment on the timeline for securing the U.S. capacity and whether bringing this capacity online might shift your neuromodulator's product mix further towards Relfydess, considering that the rest of your toxin portfolio is still expected to be manufactured out of the U.K.

Flemming Ornskov
CEO & Director

No. Our focus is still and Ipsen is doing an excellent job is to continue to manufacture in a reliable manner. In the history, we had some stock outs, but we've had a very good record now of delivery on time, and that's very important because of the very strong growth rate that we're seeing with Relfydess. We had a bit of subdued launch in Europe because we are new to the manufacturing of neuromodulators. We built a totally new manufacturing site in Sweden. So we were a little bit cautious that we would not run out of stock, and we have not done that. We prioritized which countries we were launching in.

The other thing that was very important and is still impacting a little bit of our launch trajectory for Relfydess is we have to run a lot of batches to prepare for the filing of the complete response letter in -- with the FDA. So we have choices to be made all the time between making sure we have supply for the products where we are -- in the countries where we're also launched and making sure we have batches enough for answering all the questions that we have to answer with the FDA. As I see right now because, remember, it's a lot of batches that have to be run and we have to do testing on these batches. Everything seems to be going in the right direction, whether it's going to be in December or flip into January, I do not know, but I think we're on track.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And it comes the line of Richard Vosser from JPMorgan.

Richard Vosser
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Question on Relfydess and the approval in the UAE. Obviously, as you said, Flemming, no presence there. So I'm just thinking how would you size the opportunity? And how you would attack that opportunity in other areas where you don't have Dysport under your control? And how we should think about the opportunity in those areas for Relfydess?

Flemming Ornskov
CEO & Director

Well, the Middle East is a region that is near and dear in my heart as it is in the drug department. Because as we go through a lot of challenges in that region, we had just [Technical Difficulty] so we set out of a venture, which was not a easy venture through arbitration and a whole, in my case, a kind of lawsuit to fight and secure our ability to sell our products in the region. So first, we make really good progress with fillers, now with Sculptra, now comes the next stage, which is with Relfydess, we will be -- because Relfydess is approved in March at the beginning of the year. It's a region that continues to surprise me. I recently was at a conference, AMWC in Dubai. I heard that there will be 3,000 people at the conference. I think there were 6,000 people there. And I saw the interest in Relfydess, which we just got approved in time.

So I cannot quantify at this stage, but it's also coincides with the fact that this is one of the regions where there's also very significant treatment for GLP-1. It's almost OTC. So I think both what we're seeing for Sculptra and for fillers is very strong growth. And I imagine now having the full [Technical Difficulty] with Relfydess, should help us to secure more market share overall in injectable aesthetics. And as you know, a lot of people from different parts of Europe are gravitating towards now also putting their clinics in UAE. And the bigger market is, of course, at KSA or Saudi, so [Technical Difficulty] so I'm optimistic about it, but it's going to take a bit of time.

Thomas J. Dittrich
Chief Financial Officer

But let me just add from a profitability standpoint, Relfydess in the Middle East is super attractive because from the first unit onwards, it's royalty free. We don't have to pay any royalties to Ipsen. So that's also very attractive profitability-wise. And it is, of course, an added brand and over time will be a contributor to our profitability and margin expansion.

Operator

And now we're going to take our last question for today. And it comes from the line of Natalia Webster from RBC.

Natalia Webster
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

It's just a follow-up on what you mentioned around Relfydess in contribution to margins. Are you able to comment a bit more on when you expect this to be a meaningful driver to margins? Do we still need to see the U.S. approval? And then those royalty caps to be reached in major markets for this?

Thomas J. Dittrich
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thank you, Natalia. Yes, you're right. I mean, from an overall margin standpoint, think about what Flemming just said earlier. These ramps go slowly, steadily, but this is really sticky stuff. But it ramps slowly and remember, you'll never have a patent cliff either. So we really want to do it the right way that doctors like it, patients like it [Technical Difficulty] patient doctor discussions. So that's what it is. And then from a margin standpoint, I just said, look, there are some geographies like UAE and Middle East that are royalty free because we did not have the right to Dysport there. So that's really attractive.

So there, you have a contribution right from the get-go. And then other territories in which we have the right to Dysport, that's in various geographies. And there, you have to hit certain levels. Really in the U.S., once approved, we would get -- given the size of the growth of the market, we would get to that threshold quicker than in the other territories where we have to pay royalties. So there takes a little bit longer. But overall, a very good trajectory and the excitement from patients seeing that fast onset and health care professionals fast onset and the long duration, that's really what we should focus on. And profitability will follow and it's very attractive for us. So that will almost take care of itself.

Emil Ivanov
Head of Strategy, Investor Relations & ESG

Thank you very much for the question. Thank you, Thomas and Flemming for the answers. I will now pass over to Flemming to give his final remarks so that we can close the webcast.

Flemming Ornskov
CEO & Director

First of all, thank you so much for your thoughtful questions and also for your patience. I think you'll recognize that we're good at commercial execution, maybe we need to be a little bit better at meeting execution, but we always strive to improve. The good news was, it happened on a day when we had strong results, so you couldn't accuse us of trying to hide something.

So as we highlighted today, we continue to be on a very strong trajectory, a very focused execution, both on our existing portfolio and new innovation. I can hear through the questions, you're very excited about a lot of new innovation, but don't forget, the vast majority of the growth is coming from our existing portfolio. We delivered USD 3.7 billion for the first 9 months, record, growing 15% at constant currency, widespread growth across product categories and geographies. Of course, you all honed in on Nemluvio, very strong growth in the U.S., but we also with neuromodulators that also showed very strong growth. We also had some benefit from some phasing in full transparency. A lot of questions from you U.S. tariffs. I think Thomas gave you a crystal clear answer with what we see today is factored into the 2025 guidance, but it is a bit of a moving target.

U.S., as you can see, is very important for us, neuromodulators, Cetaphil, now Nemluvio. And of course, we also will invest significantly in the U.S., USD 650 million, as you may have read, U.S. dollar up to 2030 because we clearly need to increase our manufacturing footprint there. And given the importance of a number of products, Alastin, Nemluvio and Cetaphil, that's a necessary investment. And I think, as you've seen, strong growth trajectory, Nemluvio strong performance. We've updated our full year guidance, I think, not by a small percent, but significantly, both on top and bottom line. And with that, again, thank you so much for your thoughtful questions today, and have a great rest of the day.

This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect. Have a nice day.
