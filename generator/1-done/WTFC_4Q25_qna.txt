[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets.

Jon Arfstrom
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Can we -- usually start with loan growth, but can you talk a little bit more about that, Tim, kind of the -- what takes you to the mid-single digit, what takes you to the high single-digit. It sounds like you're off to a stronger start, even though you're flagging some -- how the first quarter and second quarter can sometimes be a little bit softer, but it feels like you're entering the year with pretty good momentum. Can you just unpack that a little bit for us?

Timothy Crane
CEO, President & Director

Sure. A little bit, Jon and Rich can help me here. But again, we're cautiously optimistic about what we're hearing in the local economies where we operate. Employment levels, unemployment levels are low, and it was a pretty solid quarter for us broad-based in terms of loan growth. So I think we feel pretty good. As you mentioned, the first quarter can be a little bit softer than the second quarter for us, but the first half of the year tends to be in line with our targets. So again, I think we feel pretty good. And Rich?

Richard Murphy
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer

Yes. No, I think you answered that very well. First quarter last year was $653 million, so down from -- we're about 6%. And then we picked it up in the second quarter as you -- Jon, you know that story how our first insurance business really kind of picks up the pace there in the second quarter. So we had a really good second half, but there's -- but where that comes from, is, as I mentioned, some really good market positioning right now in our C&I and CRE space that we feel pretty good about. When we talk to customers, as I mentioned, they feel pretty good about where the economy stands right now and I think our -- there's enough stability in the general picture where they're willing to invest.

And then you look at the different verticals that we saw really good success with in the fourth quarter in particular, mortgage warehouse lines. And if we get some pickup here on the mortgage side of the business, I think you'll continue to see that in the first half of the year. Leasing, resi, mortgage also had a good quarter. So there's a lot of different things that feel pretty good right now. But again, the effect of the first quarter phenomenon in the premium finance business is something that we would expect to see usually reversing then back in the second quarter.

Jon Arfstrom
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. Good. And then maybe Tim or Dave, you talked about the positive operating leverage. I mean there was a big lift in 2025. What are some of the puts and takes on expenses and overall thoughts on the expense plans for 2026?

David Dykstra
Vice Chairman & COO

Well, I think it's probably sort of more of the same story that we've had before. If we have that mid- to high single-digit revenue growth, so sort of say, 7.5%, 8% is sort of the middle of the target. We would expect -- and that's off of the fourth quarter run rate. We would expect expenses off of the fourth quarter run rate probably to be in that 4% to 5% range. And so we expect to get positive operating leverage again. And if you had revenue that was at the lower end of that range, then we would -- we have tightened up on expenses. So the -- the goal is to get a positive operating expense, invest in the business to support stronger growth as we've always done and grow the franchise.

So as you know, second and third quarter is a little bit higher for marketing and sponsorships for us and the first and the fourth quarters are lower. But health insurance claims tend to -- are tending to be up a little bit in this market. And so they may rise a little bit. But all of that is sort of baked into this, say, 4% to 5% expected growth based on the fourth quarter run rate. And again, that gets you operating leverage. If loan growth was lower for some reason, which we don't expect right now, we see a lot of good opportunities, and we would probably trim back a little bit on expenses, but we're big believers in investing in the business to grow the franchise.

Timothy Crane
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Jon, the 2 kind of wild cards. One, I think everybody is seeing benefit expense go up fairly substantially. The other is if the mortgage business picks up, we'll get more expense, but that would be good news for us because we would get obviously more revenue as well. Otherwise, I think Dave got the answer there.

Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Race of Piper Sandler.

Nathan Race
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

You bet. I was hoping to unpack just the decline in deposit costs in the quarter, some of the drivers there. So maybe, Tim, could you just speak to how much of the opportunity to reduce deposit costs in the quarter was just a function of more rational competition in Chicago these days or maybe just some complexion changes in terms of the Wintrust deposit composition over the years that has allowed you guys to put up some favorable deposit reductions slightly?

Timothy Crane
CEO, President & Director

Yes, you bet, Nate. I guess 2 things. One, our team did a really nice job moving deposits as the Fed moved, and we talked about the expectation that we would be able to do that. And that, in fact, did play out in the fourth quarter. We also had kind of a nice trend in terms of DDA deposits during the quarter. That can be a little bit lumpy at year-end as companies position themselves for their reporting activities. But we continue to see good growth in terms of the commercial deposits of the bank and the treasury services they use, and we're going to continue to work that mix. It's just -- it can be a little bit lumpy. But -- we were very pleased with the way deposit costs were managed in the quarter.

Nathan Race
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just looking at some of the deposit growth drivers, it looked like it mainly came in the non-maturity segment. So just curious, do you see additional opportunities to run off higher cost. CDs going forward? And can you kind of just speak to maybe the CD repricing benefit that you have with like 95% or so of your deposits that are CDs maturing by end of this year.

Timothy Crane
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I think there's probably a minor benefit. Again, I would emphasize minor on the CD book rolling as we continue into 2026. But the noninterest or the interest-bearing deposit growth supports our loan growth. And as we continue to grow loans at a pretty healthy level, we've stated that we would try to continue to fund that with new deposits. And our deposit costs can be a little bit higher than some of our peers. We're fine with that as we add clients to the bank that will be with us for a long time.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Chris McGratty of KBW.

Christopher McGratty
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Tim or Dave, I guess, what's not where you want it to be? It seems like a lot of positives in one column. What's not where you want it to be in terms of either growth by asset class or anything operationally.

Timothy Crane
CEO, President & Director

Well, we'd like the mortgage business to be stronger. We think we've done a good job of paring back the expense related to that business. So it's not damaging to us at these relatively low levels from a volume standpoint. We'd always like more commercial activity, but we remain pretty disciplined about trying to pick relationships versus transaction activity. And periodically, as some of our peers try to get loan growth, we've seen some transactional activity and some odd pricing. But we think we're -- we continue to be well positioned in the market. Size-wise, there are very few local institutions near where we are. We think that's an advantage for us. And net-net, we continue to feel like we're in a pretty good position.

Christopher McGratty
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then just following up, Tim, you don't need to do a deal with that kind of growth, but you have historically kind of entertained tuck-ins. Like what's the latest on M&A appetite?

Timothy Crane
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Chris, you're right. I mean we're aiming for organic growth, and that would be our plan. If we get an opportunity to do an acquisition, we think we're reasonably good at acquisitions, at least the smaller ones that we've done. Conversations continue. There's a little bit of fits and starts, but nothing that's worth talking about right now. And our business plan for 2026 is based on growing our business organically.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Brendan Nosal of Hovde Group.

Brendan Nosal
Hovde Group, LLC, Research Division

Just to start off on capital. You've built ratios nicely over the last 12 months despite robust loan growth. Is there a point at which you see alternative deployment outlets for capital beyond the dividend and organic growth.

David Dykstra
Vice Chairman & COO

Well, I think as we talked before, I mean, generally, if you grow the mid- to high single digits, we're probably growing capital at 10 basis points a quarter, plus or minus. And so -- and we've been doing that. I think, as we said before, we want to focus on organic growth and see how strong that is. If that number starts to get to 10.5% or above, and we don't have any good acquisition opportunities and organic growth is mid- to high single digits. That number would keep growing. So then I think you would look at buybacks and then dividend increases. But generally, it would be organic growth, well-priced acquisitions, smaller acquisitions, I think, would be #2 than a buyback.

And just for reference. We haven't talked about this in a while, but we do have a little over $200 million of an authorized buyback plan in place that we could use down the road if we wanted to. But right now, I think we're letting it grow a little bit, going to see how the organic growth opportunities go and whether we can use it for that, and then we'll play by year after a couple of quarters down the road.

Brendan Nosal
Hovde Group, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Okay. That's helpful. One more for me, just pivoting to credit and specifically the reserve. I think if I look back over the past 2 years, you've been gradually saving a couple of basis points here and there off reserve ratios, whether it's the stated reserve to loan or the ACL to the core loan portfolio. I guess that a lot of that is formulaic and driven by outside factors. So just kind of take us through the thought process on gradually bringing down reserves? And where do you see coverage ratios trending across 2026?

David Dykstra
Vice Chairman & COO

Well, we don't plan whether to build reserves or take reserves away, the CECL process and the macroeconomic factors and the mix of the portfolio and the process we go through to determine reserves really determines the level of those reserves. So if the economic forecast gets much worse for some reason, if the economy gets worse, and you're going to see that coverage ratio go up. What we saw sort of during the year is that the economic forecast, generally, we're getting better. And so the model just spits out the results. But our credit, as we talked about, has been very good. Our criticized and classified levels are very low. Our NPAs are very low. Our charge-offs are low. And so we had economic conditions or even some commercial real estate price indexes got better early in the year and the like.

And so we really do a fairly thorough process of using economic data, digging down with our teams on the loan side to build what that reserve should be. So we don't go into it with some preconceived notion that we should build reserves or release reserves. We look at all the factors and record the provision accordingly. So I don't want to give you an outlook as to whether you're going to build or release because I don't know what the economic factors are going to be in the future. And if you remember, CECL is a forward-looking concept, not a backward-looking concept.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Rulis of D.A. Davidson.

Jeff Rulis
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Tim, maybe just back to the -- you talked about the macro environment being pretty favorable or optimistic with your customers. I wanted to touch on the competitive landscape, some of your larger Midwest peers are engaged with deal activity down in the Southeast and Texas and wanted to kind of -- is a portion of your growth or market share gains from maybe competitors being focused elsewhere? Just a thought on -- if you could touch on that.

Timothy Crane
CEO, President & Director

Sure. We've always benefited from disruption, distraction, call it whatever you want. But -- we believe our position in the Midwest is an attractive one. We believe the markets we compete in are actually very good markets. There's a lot of density. There's a lot of wealth. And to the extent that others elect to focus elsewhere at times, I think that's only helpful to us. But we compete with all of the big banks every day and a handful of Chicago-based competitors and, in some cases, credit unions in some of our markets. And so we believe we differentiate based on service and the people at the company, and we'll continue to do that.

Jeff Rulis
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

And I guess, Tim, just to kind of follow up then. I mean, you've outstripped a little bit of the -- even the high single digit, I think, 11% loan growth. And just trying to think about timing, do you look at '26 as equal opportunity on that disruption as you've had in maybe the prior year? I guess the question being, any change to that? Is that closing? Are you seeing folks kind of reorient with the Midwest and might be a more competitive year ahead loaded question?

Timothy Crane
CEO, President & Director

No. Well, it's hard to say. I think there certainly are lots of fits and starts for various competitors, and we have some folks that are trying to open more locations in Chicago and people that are trying to move teams. So I don't think that's anything really new. The only piece that I would say on loan growth relative to the last few years is -- we've obviously had a little bit of a tailwind in terms of premium finance with premiums rising in addition to the bank growing the number of units that we produce. And I think there is some flattening in terms of the premium environment for insurance companies. I don't -- people use soft and hard in all those terms. I just think it's probably up to us to grow the loans now as opposed to getting help from the market.

Jeff Rulis
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Appreciate it. And just one other one. Rich, looking at the linked quarter commercial nonperforming loan increase, again, not big and probably flat to down from the second quarter. So the balances are kind of moving around. But anything you'd point to on the commercial linked quarter increase on nonperforming loans?

Richard Murphy
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer

No, not really. It's more episodic in nature, and we've said this in the past where we see things as just kind of one-off things and we work to solve them and move along. I think when I look at credit quality in the portfolio, we really focus on where the special mention substandard numbers are, which we're seeing at a pretty consistent level. So things will occasionally go bump in the night, and that's our job to fix those. But this is really more for this quarter, at least more of a -- we would kind of identify it as more episodic.

Jeff Rulis
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

And Rich, on the -- I guess, as we approach a year from kind of the tariff liberation day noise, your sense of customers, is there more maybe relative ease? I mean, that threat is always out there, but from a customer standpoint, do you sense any more comfortability than you were 9 months ago?

Richard Murphy
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer

Yes. I think the ease around the tariffs is real. I think probably maybe even more so is I think labor costs, if you go back a year or two years ago, labor costs and finding labor was really problematic. I think that, that's improved quite a bit. And I think people kind of look at just a more stable labor environment, more predictable from an expense perspective. And so they're a little more comfortable today.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of David Long of Raymond James.

David Long
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

We talked about M&A, and I understand you guys have an excellent organic growth opportunity in front of you and fully taking advantage of it. But in the past, you've talked about other MSAs and looking to replicate what you do in Chicago and other MSAs, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Indianapolis have been mentioned. Is there any appetite to move outside of the Chicago MSA at this point?

Timothy Crane
CEO, President & Director

Well, I mean we're in Southeast Wisconsin and West Michigan now, which you know, David. I mean we would be opportunistic in other Midwest geographies that we don't cover today, but that would be on a disciplined basis. And where we haven't been able to acquire, we've, in some cases, open branches, and we've been effective in doing so.

We've talked in the past about Rockford, and we've got some branches opening in Northwest Indiana this coming year. So we'll take the opportunities as they come to us. But if we need to go to other geographies organically, we think we've proven our ability to do that.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy of Stephens Inc.

Terence McEvoy
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Maybe, Tim, just a question for you. As the industry continues to evolve, what are your current thoughts on the strategic benefits of operating 16 banking charters kind of relative to some of the costs and leveraging the Wintrust brand?

Timothy Crane
CEO, President & Director

Yes. The charter question comes up periodically and we currently have 16 for those of you that are following along. We believe they continue to be a benefit for us. They keep us closer to the market than many of our competitors. We've centralized most of the infrastructure and expense that goes along with the charters. And so it's really more of a marketing and market function that we believe is valuable to us.

And if you look at the communities in which we operate in many of those communities, we're the #1 or #2 market share in very attractive markets. That's not a benefit we want to give up at this point. So we watch it carefully. The expense is not trajectory changing. It's a structure that we believe we operate well and we'll continue to evaluate it as we go. But for the time being, we like it. There are clearly benefits. Deposit insurance is one of them, our MaxSafe product, obviously gives us the ability to provide customers more insurance than they might otherwise get. There are other benefits. And as you would expect, there are some other trade-offs, but the net balance for us remains positive.

Terence McEvoy
Stephens Inc., Research Division

And then as a follow-up, about 1/3 of last quarter's loan growth was in mortgage warehouse. And I think in the past, you've talked about gaining market share. But when you kind of look at the forward curve, is that portfolio kind of a headwind, a tailwind to growth expectations for '26.

Timothy Crane
CEO, President & Director

Obviously, it depends on what happens to the mortgage market. We've been successful in growing that business in a stable mortgage market because of the expertise our team brings and the job our folks do from an operational standpoint. But for us, that's a 0 loss business with very attractive dynamics. We think we're very efficient. It will move a little bit with the mortgage volume over time. And if the mortgage market gets stronger, as we've talked about, it's a benefit to us both in terms of our core business and the warehouse business.

Richard Murphy
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer

In addition to which I think it's a great point, Tim brings up. The market, obviously, but they have done a really nice job of bringing new names in, and that comes with if you get the volume, you also get some fee income out of that and some very nice deposits. So I mean, it's really -- it's been a great story in spite of the fact that you might get some volatility in overall rates. So we like where we sit in that space right now.

David Dykstra
Vice Chairman & COO

But Terry, this is Dave Dykstra. I would just add, the mortgage market has been bouncing around the bottom for so long. I say, a period of time, there's way more upside than downside there. It just doesn't seem like the volumes are going to go much lower in the mortgage market. So I would think net-to-net over quarter-to-quarter, it may change a little bit. But net-net, there's probably more upside than downside there.

Richard Murphy
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer

Exactly.

Our next question comes from the line of Casey Haire of Autonomous Research.

Casey Haire
Autonomous Research Limited

Dave, wanted to clarify your comments about the operating leverage dynamics. I think you said, you expect mid- to high single-digit revenue off of '25 and then expenses to grow mid- to high -- 4% to 5% versus the fourth quarter run rate. There's a little bit of excitement that you meant or that you said mid- to high single digits revenue growth off the fourth quarter run rate. Just wanted to clarify that.

David Dykstra
Vice Chairman & COO

Yes. No, we're talking off of the -- something we generally have had acquisitions in past years, and we grow organically so good. We generally try to give you guidance of the fourth quarter run rate versus the full year. So when I'm talk -- when we're talking about forward growth, we're talking about off of the fourth quarter run rate on both sides there.

Casey Haire
Autonomous Research Limited

Okay. All right. And then just a follow-up on the -- a couple of follow-ups on the NIM. So first off on -- I have your interest-bearing deposit beta cycle to date around 57%. Just some updated thoughts as to where that can trend to in '26?

Timothy Crane
CEO, President & Director

Yes. As we've talked about on prior calls, our guess on the deposit beta in terms of total cycle is going to be in the low 60s. And we continue to believe if we get rate cuts that we'll do a nice job managing the deposit, the interest-bearing deposit expense. And so I don't think our view has changed there.

Casey Haire
Autonomous Research Limited

Okay. Very good. And just last one for me. The hedge program that you guys detailed on Slide 12, you do have a number of hedges that mature this year. Does that hurt your ability to hold the NIM stable? Or is there a plan to backfill with new hedges as they come off?

David Dykstra
Vice Chairman & COO

No. Our guidance fully contemplates those hedging programs running off, but we would expect depending on market conditions to backfill that and just probably do some forward starts and fill in the gaps going forward as they mature. But we think given our current position, our current swaps in place and our growth projections is that we will hold the margin in the 3.50s. And as Tim said, if rates go up 2 or 3x or down 2 or 3x, we still think we're there. So we think we're very neutral for a full year with the margin.

Operator

Next question comes from the line of David Chiaverini of Jefferies.

David Chiaverini
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Maybe just starting off with a further clarification on that run rate comment. So are we talking 4Q '26 versus 4Q '25, those growth rate figures? Or are we talking full year '26 versus the 4Q '25 annualized?

David Dykstra
Vice Chairman & COO

Take 4Q '25 annualize that to get to a number, and then you can put the growth rates on top of that for the full year of '26.

David Chiaverini
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Perfect. And then I wanted to ask about the mortgage banking outlook. It sounds like that could be a nice swing factor for 2026. Can you talk about your expectations in terms of volume, gain on sale margins, whether those could increase or be under pressure? And just give us a sense of how optimistic you are on that business.

David Dykstra
Vice Chairman & COO

Well, I guess we've always been optimistic. I think the last 2 years, I've been optimistic for a great spring buying season. It hasn't occurred, but we are optimistic. There's still a supply shortage out there. But I mean, if you look at our mix of business in the fourth quarter, it was about 50-50 purchase in refi. And in the prior 3 quarters, it was probably 3/4 purchase and a quarter refi. So as rates have come down, we've seen a little bit of a pickup in refi, but also a slow winter buying season in the fourth quarter. But if you sort of look at the service portfolio that we have out there, which is a sizable portfolio, we've got maybe at the current rates around in the low 6s, we've got between 10% and 15% of that portfolio is sort of in the money to refi.

But if rates go down another 25 basis points or, let's say, 50 basis points, you'd have more like 1/4 of that portfolio would be refiable. So we think if rates go down 25 to 50 basis points on the mortgage side that we could have some pickup. But the tenure has been going up. And so I can't predict interest rates, but we are optimistic that if the mortgage rates stay where they are now, and drop a little bit further into '26 that there's some pickup there. There's upside. And we don't think that going out -- going down much further is really that probable. We've been in the low 20s for quite a while here and with very low application volume. So unless rates really shoot up in the mortgage market, we think we can hold this revenue. So we look at it as upside, and we're optimistic it happens, but we can't control the mortgage rates.

Timothy Crane
CEO, President & Director

Yes. And maybe the other benefit, which has been the case now for a couple of years is as these low rates have continued many of the sort of refinance independent broker mortgage operations have gone out of business. And so our share of the market, we think, is up considerably. And when it comes back, we expect to do well.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Ben Gerlinger of Citi.

Benjamin Gerlinger
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Sorry, I just wanted to double check and maybe fine-tune a little bit here. And I apologize for being a little myopic on it, but you talked through the -- or the property casualty insurance market, and I agree, softening versus strengthening, I don't know either. But it seems like the pricing is a little limited year-over-year. So is it fair to think like 2Q will still be a good growth quarter, but maybe not as heroic as we've seen previously? I'm just trying to fine-tune the first half of the year in terms of modeling growth.

Timothy Crane
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I think the only point we were trying to make is that for the last couple of years, we've had the benefit of premiums going up. That may not be the case right now. We don't think they're working against us. But we still expect a strong second quarter. It's seasonal component of the Property & Casualty premium finance business, and we would expect to have a good second quarter.

Benjamin Gerlinger
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Got you. And then just kind of at a 50,000-foot view, you guys generally trend to show loan growth and deposit growth in roughly the same quarter. Is that a fair way to think about this year given kind of what's transpired over rates and your outlook for growth?

Timothy Crane
CEO, President & Director

Yes. We certainly aim for deposit growth to mirror our loan growth, and we would take more deposit growth if we could get it. Again, that's adding clients that will be with us for a long time. It can be lumpy. So I can't tell you they're going to exactly mirror each other, but that would be our target.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Jared Shaw of Barclays.

Jared David Shaw
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Most have been asked and answered. But I guess just as you look at hiring incremental revenue producers here, are you seeing competition impacting what you have to pay for new people here? Or what's sort of driving the movement of revenue producers among companies right now?

Timothy Crane
CEO, President & Director

Yes, I don't think there's been a hugely material change. Obviously, top-tier producers can be expensive. And we think we do a good job of not only working our own team and periodically finding others. We don't talk about it a lot here just because it's a normal part of our business. And so we're always looking to add folks that are very good at taking care of customers and help us differentiate our services.

Jared David Shaw
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just finally, looking at construction down this quarter, any color on the build-out of construction and how that could potentially be funded up as we move through next year or this year?

Richard Murphy
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer

You're talking about just general construction lending?

Jared David Shaw
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Yes. Yes, it was down this quarter, I'm guessing from completions, but sort of what's the growth outlook there?

Richard Murphy
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer

Yes. I would say it's kind of -- Chicago hasn't been a huge construction market. We've seen a little bit, but I think there's more upside there. I mean, multifamily, for instance, in Chicago, continues to be very strong. Some other markets are maybe struggling a little bit more because of oversupply. So I actually think we're feeling okay about where construction activity will be for this coming year.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Janet Lee of TD Cowen.

Sun Young Lee
TD Cowen, Research Division

Not to beat on a dead horse, but just to clarify on your outlook for resi mortgage and mortgage warehouse, is your mid- to high single-digit loan growth for 2026 contemplate a level of bullish, like are you assuming that mortgage rate perhaps dip to the 5% handle? Like are you baking in a level of mortgage rate reduction in your mid- to high single-digit outlook? Or were you referring to an additional upside to the mid- to high single-digit loan growth if mortgage rates do dip below 6%?

Timothy Crane
CEO, President & Director

Janet, the assumption would be a slightly improved mortgage market in line with the Mortgage Bankers Association projections, not any dramatic drop in rates. And Dave, a couple of minutes ago, gave you a little bit of a sense for how much volume you could get if the rates dropped. But I think to get any very, very material lift rates would have to go below 6%.

Sun Young Lee
TD Cowen, Research Division

Got it. And on your NIM outlook for stable, I think there's room for interpretation since you're characterizing 4 basis point increase in NIM this quarter as being stable. You're pretty neutral to rates, it seems and 60% beta also seems solid. What are some of the drivers that could put you to either perhaps increasing net interest margin through 2026 and are you still seeing the phenomena of seeing some spread compressions on fully funded CRE, which you've talked about in the past quarters?

Timothy Crane
CEO, President & Director

Well, we've talked about competitive pressures largely from folks that maybe haven't grown as quickly as we have and kind of desire to do that. And so I think there still is a fairly competitive environment for fully funded loans. But some of that's transaction-based, and we're really much more focused on relationship-based arrangements. If the competitive environment change dramatically, you could get some pressure on the margin. Obviously, the first quarter with a couple of fewer days has a math impact on the margin. But we're actually pretty neutral almost independent of rate changes and given the visibility to the competitive environment, that would be the case there, too.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Bill Hebel of 22V Research.

Bill Hebel

Can you just maybe talk through the fixed asset reprice that you're seeing on both the loan and the security side, kind of where roll-on, roll-off yields are in both books?

David Dykstra
Vice Chairman & COO

Yes. We really haven't talked about the roll-off yields on them. We have so very little commercial and commercial real estate fixed asset repricing. Most of our fixed asset repricing comes out of the premium finance portfolios. Life is fixed for a year, and so it reprices once a year. So it takes a full year for that portfolio to reprice. That portfolio is generally 12-month CMT plus 200 basis points. So if you look back a year and see where the 12-month CMT was and look at current rates, you can kind of calculate that impact and commercial premium finance is generally -- it's not tied to prime, but generally has good correlation to the prime rate, and they're 9-month loans that are fixed rate that pay monthly.

So it takes 9 to 10 months for them to generally turn over. So again, if you look back at what the prime rate was 9 to 12 months ago and look at where they are now, you can probably get some good feel for that repricing. The commercial portfolio repricing on securities, it's very little cash flow. So a basis point or 2 here or there impact, nothing material.
