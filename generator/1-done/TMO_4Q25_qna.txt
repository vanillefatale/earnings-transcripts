[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Ryskin from Bank of America.

Michael Ryskin
BofA Securities, Research Division

Great. And first off, I'll mirror Marc's comments. Congrats, Stephen. It's been a great run. It's been a pleasure working with you and wish you all the best going forward. Maybe I'll start with a high-level one on the guide. As you laid out, you guys had a framework previously that you talked to and then the guide falls in that range. Just -- but still, you're talking about the acceleration from 2% you did in 2025 organic to this 3% to 4%. Just can you talk a little bit more about what's underpinning that? What gives you confidence in that reacceleration? Any particular end markets or customer groups that -- where you're seeing the most improvement in activity as you look ahead? And I have a quick follow-up.

Marc Casper
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. So Mike, thanks for the question. When I think about the way we are opening up our guidance for the year, -- we're actually assuming market conditions are going to be pretty similar to 2025. As a reminder, we had just under 1 point of pandemic runoff in our 2025 results. So adjusted for that, we roughly had 3% growth last year, and we're assuming that we're going to be in the 3% to 4% range. And as Stephen said, start with the assumptions around 3%. What we expect over time in this 2-year time frame is that just the absence of the negatives will start to allow for conditions to improve and build within that range. But we don't want to make any major changes into the markets to start the year. There's lots of things I'm optimistic about actually just based on how January is in terms of customer meetings and so forth. But we just want to set ourselves up and the industry for success this year.

Michael Ryskin
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. And then maybe as a quick follow-up. Again, Stephen, you referred to that prior framework you gave on the 2Q guide last year at the time, I think you talked about 3% to 6% over the course of 2026 and 2027 combined. Just want to make sure that entire framework is still intact, especially how we think about next year, about 2027, -- nothing has really changed in your forward outlook there.

Stephen Williamson
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I think when we gave the -- back at the time when we gave that framework and where we are now, yes, we see it consistent in terms of our assumptions about the future, and we're executing towards that. So yes.

Marc Casper
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. And what I would add is that one of the key focuses back in April is that irrespective of market conditions, we were just going to deliver great earnings growth, right? And we did a great job of navigating 2025. There was a lot of headwinds around tariffs and so forth that we just worked our way through and delivering 5% EPS growth for the year.

I feel very good about in our opening position with effectively around 3% growth, we're assuming 6% to 8% of EPS growth without any of the capital deployment embedded into that. So that's what we can control. That's what we're going to deliver. And I'm optimistic about the progression of the industry as well, but we wanted to keep ourselves focused on controlling our destiny, which is just great earnings growth, drive share gain, and that's going to serve us well.

Our next question comes from Dan Arias from Stifel.

Daniel Arias
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Marc, I wanted to ask about biopharma here. One of the ideas seems to be that sentiment on spending at a high level has improved just because these companies are seemingly breathing a little easier now that you have some of these MFN deals in place. I'm just curious, are you finding that that's actually translating the spending plans or '26 pharma budgets actually looking better to the extent that you can tell with these meetings that you're having so far?

Marc Casper
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, Dan, so it's a great question. So we have a really unique set of capabilities to serve pharma and biotech, right? And when I think about the year last year, mid-single-digit growth. Obviously, we had some headwinds around the final roll-off of the pandemic embedded in that to finish the quarter -- the last quarter at high single-digit growth. Team is doing a great job. And our customers really value trusted partner, and I'll come back to that in a moment.

So when I think about the tone of what we heard in the health care conference and certainly in my meetings in Europe in January, I saw quite a number of customers. Pharma consistent with what we've been hearing for a while, which is good confidence around the ability to navigate governments, and feel good about the things that have been agreed to and excitement around their pipeline. So the tone feels good in pharma. And I think that ultimately, we'll see that in activity. And then from a biotech, you're seeing the data to show that funding is starting to improve, but the tone was incredibly positive.

Now there's, of course, there's a lag between when funding flows and when money is spent. But I would say January in terms of what the sentiment is in our customer base was quite positive. Trusted partner is the other aspect of it, right? There's one is what is the industry and two is what is our role in all of this. When I think about trusted partner, I've talked about it for a number of years. And so what does it really mean? And I thought maybe 2 anecdotes -- might be helpful to just bring it to reality, right? Because we see lots of customers and all of our industry peers do. So I was at a health care conference.

I was meeting with the CEO of one of our larger customers and discussing objectives for the year, where we can be helpful, what are the challenges. The discussion was so positive that he literally said, can we go and find my Head of Development and -- which we did. And let's talk about the specifics, right? Literally, just kind of real time, we tracked his peer down or his colleague down, and we got into the details and the right follow-ups happen from that.

And if I think about spending half day with the management team of one of our larger biotech customers and just working through systematically about what are their priorities, how we can help them and then the long list of follow-ups about what the new opportunities are and why that's so relevant to their success. I hope that brings that a little bit more to life. And it's across our whole management team we're having the dialogue, right? And that's the super cool thing about our role in pharma and biotech and why we're so well positioned there.

Daniel Arias
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. Okay. Helpful perspective. Maybe just to sort of summarize the point that you kind of touched on there, mid-single-digit growth in 2025 in biopharma in a year with some obvious headwinds. Is mid-singles plus the right way to think about things or something different?

Stephen Williamson
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, I think that's the right way to frame it. There's obviously different ways we can get to the 3% to 4%, but that's -- I think that's the way to frame the year as we stand here now.

Our next question comes from Jack Meehan from Nephron Research.

Jack Meehan
Nephron Research LLC

I wanted to build off of where Dan left off, but focusing on the LPBS segment. So in Pharma Services, Marc, how are you feeling about industry supply-demand dynamics entering 2026? And any color you can share on what's reflected in the guide for that business?

Marc Casper
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So when I think about our Pharma Services business, really executing very well. As a reminder, we have the leading positions in the drug product sterile fill-finish and in our clinical trials logistics packaging business. And we have a smaller position, but meaningful in biologics drug substance as well. So when I think about industry demand capacity, really sterile fill/finish has been the area where there is heightened demand relative to industry capacity.

It's part of the reason that we acquired the Sanofi site in New Jersey. It's really in a way, a capital project to expand our capacity. We're winning contracts to meet our pharmaceutical customers' needs for reshoring to the U.S. So the demand profile is good, and that business is had a strong year and we will continue to step up in growth over the next couple of years. So well positioned there. And I would believe that, that will continue to be a nice contributor to our long-term growth in this business.

Jack Meehan
Nephron Research LLC

Excellent. Okay. And then next, I wanted to talk about the channel. So if you do some relatively simple benchmarking, it seems like you're doing pretty well there competitively. I was wondering if you could just talk about what's resonating in terms of investments you've made there? And do you see this competitive advantage as stable or expanding, weakening entering this year? Just any color on that business would be great.

Marc Casper
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, Jack, thanks for the question on our channel business. So think about how we serve the research and safety market. It's a business that's performed well for us for a long time. We have an excellent portfolio of supplier partners that has what our customers need. And you see the strength of the performance broad-based. We've done well in pharma and biotech in terms of winning business. We have done well in serving industrial customers.

We called that out. And while academic and government is certainly more pressured as the end market is, actually, our share position has been quite stable there. So I think competitive dynamics remain pretty consistent. We've been a methodical share gainer over many years, and that trend continues, and we'll continue to do a great job serving our customers and helping them meet their innovation and productivity needs.

Our next question comes from Matt Larew from William Blair.

Matthew Larew
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Since you launched Accelerator in late 2024, obviously, a number of pretty big changes in the drug development and manufacturing ecosystem in terms of manufacturing regionalization, rising use of AI and drug discovery. Marc, you referenced outstanding customer adoption of that solution. Just curious how some of these ecosystem changes are affecting customer preferences for outsourcing in general, and I guess, more specifically in the Accelerator offering.

Marc Casper
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, Matt, great question. So when I think about -- let me start with this clinical research more broadly, and then I'll delve into change and a little bit about Accelerator. So the clinical research business for Thermo Fisher is performing very well. And the year played out really exactly as we thought it would play out and with a steady progression of revenue building sequentially quarter-over-quarter and then returning to growth in Q3 and mid-single-digit growth in Q4 organically. And authorizations have been far ahead of our revenue throughout the year and is showing the strong momentum in our competitive position.

So when I think about accelerated drug development, which was something that we worked on creating for almost 3 years, we launched it in the fourth quarter of 2024. What it really is about is how do you shave a week off here, a month off there, how do you get waste out of the system and ultimately meaningfully bring the drugs to market more quickly or have insights that the drug is not performing well and therefore, end the clinical trial more quickly, both of which add value to our customers.

And it's really resulting in very meaningful authorizations wins for both our clinical research business and new total contracts for our Pharma Services business. So it is a differentiated capabilities. It's one that we've really worked hard to understand where the best opportunity is and then apply it to customers. When I think about how we are collaborating with OpenAI, really focused on the clinical research side of the thing -- the equation is how do you further shave time and cost out of the process and have even more insights.

And that's going to be a journey because it's a highly regulated industry, and we'll go on that journey with our customers and look for new opportunities to drive an even more efficient drug development process. And our experience is the higher the returns our sponsors get on their investment, the more indications they want to go after in terms of the scale of the clinical trials and they actually, in a way, pursue their pipeline more aggressively. So we're really excited about what the future holds in terms of drug development more broadly, both in the manufacturing of the medicines as well as executing the clinical research.

Matthew Larew
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Okay. So encouraged about drug development activities. But thinking about the drug discovery side, I think still some debate about whether AI is a headwind or tailwind to the amount of wet lab work moving forward. Just would be curious what your experience has been with customers, be it AI-first biotechs and then larger pharma companies that were perhaps more aggressively using AI and what you're seeing about their wet lab activity, their demand for instruments, et cetera?

Marc Casper
Chairman, President & CEO

So what we're seeing is a recovery in the early research part of our business in terms of demand for the bioscience reagents the basic R&D labs in pharma from the channel. So you're seeing that methodically strengthen. Some of that will come with biotech funding as well as that improves. What I would say is on the application of AI, we're doing a lot of work with customers on the wet lab dry lab combination, meaning that we're actually working with our customers to better link what goes on in their wet labs with their data management and insights from AI.

Our experience to date and certainly our experience historically is the more confidence you have in the research, you wind up doing actually more wet lab experimentation. You're probably going to work on less things that are just going to fail. So there is some waste that comes out of the system. But customers want to have total confidence in the work they're doing, and that's been our experience. And -- so we're actually quite optimistic about the intersection between AI and the demand for wet lab research. Thanks, Matt, for the questions.

Our next question comes from Casey Woodring from JPMorgan.

Casey Woodring
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And first, I just want to reiterate the comments. Congratulations, Stephen, on retirement. And Jim, looking forward to working with you moving forward. I wanted to touch on Analytical Instruments performance in 4Q. Curious on how the performance played out relative to your expectations in the quarter. Obviously, a tough comp, but curious to hear what you're seeing in that business across the different regions and end markets and whether you saw a budget flush in the quarter or any sort of stimulus in China.

Marc Casper
Chairman, President & CEO

Casey, thanks for the question. So the Analytical Instruments team did a really good job in the fourth quarter. As you said, we had a more challenging comparison, and we were flat growth in the quarter, and we grew modestly in the full year. So -- and when I think about that dynamic, that's in a dynamic where you have pressures on academic and government funding. You also have pressures in China more broadly throughout the year.

So 2 of the important sectors of that part of the business faced the headwinds. We did very well with our pharma and biotech customers. So I feel good about that. And I feel good about the performance in aggregate. For us, a lot of what drives it is the quality of our innovation and the impact, right? We had an incredible year, right? And if you think about where I allocated time even in my remarks today, I spent more time on innovation than anything because customers want those breakthrough solutions that matter, right?

And whether it was what we're doing in mass spectrometry, the next generation of our cryo electron microscopy for tomography and structural biology for all of those insights that we're bringing, that's what drives demand here. So the business is well positioned. We're applying AI to the capabilities as well and announced an interesting collaboration with NVIDIA at the beginning of the year. And so we'll continue to strengthen that business, and it's an important part of our company.

Casey Woodring
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

That's helpful. And then relatedly, as we think about your analytical instrument end markets, the U.S. academic market specifically there, Marc, at our conference a few weeks ago, you had talked about the expectation for U.S. academic and government customers to really remain cautious until a finalized NIH budget is passed and then for spending to increase thereafter. I guess what's assumed for U.S. academic and government growth in 2026? And really, how quickly would you expect spending to pick up after that budget is finalized? Last year, we saw a bit of a discrepancy between fund appropriations and ultimate spending with tools. So just any further color on the expectations for U.S. academic and government in 2026.

Marc Casper
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So Casey, when I think -- let me -- first globally, our assumption for academic and government embedded in our guidance is similar conditions to last year in aggregate. -- right? And when I think about the U.S. environment, our assumption here is that there'll be a level of customer caution that will probably abate as the year goes down.

But I would still assume in our guidance, it will be a more cautious environment as customers are navigating the landscape. It seems likely that we'll get a flat to slightly up NIH budget. That's going to be a good point in time exactly when that happens, [indiscernible]. So that should create tailwinds. When I think about over the next couple of years, I would expect that, that will be one of the drivers of us higher in the range. But for now, our assumption is that relatively cautious for 2026.

Rafael Tejada
Vice President of Investor Relations

Operator, we have time for one more question.

Our last question comes from Dan Brennan from TD Cowen.

Daniel Brennan
TD Cowen, Research Division

Stephen, obviously, congrats. Nice working with you. Maybe just one housekeeping, and then I'll follow up with more of like a deeper question. Just on the housekeeping. So Stephen and Marc, you want investors to put like 3% -- started 3% for 2026 and around 1% in the first quarter for organic. Is that right?

Stephen Williamson
Senior VP & CFO

That's what I indicated in my script. That's how I think about the year. And then we -- yes.

Daniel Brennan
TD Cowen, Research Division

Terrific. And then, Marc, I just wanted to ask maybe one more follow-up just on biopharma, given it's your largest end market, obviously, and really strong growth to finish out the year. I know you've mentioned a couple of times, the guide doesn't assume any change in end market conditions. And I know Dan asked this, but I think most of us are hoping or assuming that with all these deals in place and the level of, obviously, cautiousness we think has persisted that there will be some increase in spending.

So I'm just wondering, and you obviously mentioned the commentary that you had with that one customer that was pretty favorable. So was that just conservatism or maybe you are outpunching the market in 2025 so that for you, really, there's not going to be any change even if the environment gets better. Just wondering if you can kind of maybe speak to that a little bit.

Marc Casper
Chairman, President & CEO

Dan, I truly appreciate the question. So when I think about we've been consistently gaining share. So I love creating difficult comparisons. That's our job. So that's a good thing. And we'll continue to build our momentum in pharma and biotech. I think the way we're viewing the year is we're starting out with market conditions are roughly the same as last year in aggregate, and we don't have the repeat of the -- obviously, we wouldn't have the repeat of the roll-off of the effect of the pandemic last of the revenue, right? So that's the starting assumption. And as Stephen said, our goal is to retire risk as the year goes on and work our way up in the range.

And when I think about what would be the factors that would drive that, it's largely going to be, as you said, pharma and biotech, biotech in particular, as funding flows. There is a lag between when funding flows and when money is spent usually in roughly 6 months on average. But that bodes for a strengthening environment. And one can envision that it continues to strengthen into the following year as well. But I think just we all learned a lot over the last couple of years. I think starting out with a prudent set of assumptions to start the year is helpful. We're going to just deliver great earnings growth, right? I mean we're not looking at what the market is going to be.

We have a plan to deliver 6% to 8% growth plus the benefits of capital deployment, and we're excited about Clario. So we're setting ourselves up for the right way to start the year and ultimately, '26 will be another year of excellent performance for Thermo Fisher Scientific. So Dan, thank you for the questions.

And let me -- from here, just wrap up with -- thanks, everyone, for participating in the call today. And I think you got a sense from our enthusiasm. We ended this year in a great position to deliver an excellent 2026. Of course, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific, and we look forward to updating you as the year progresses. Thanks, everyone.
