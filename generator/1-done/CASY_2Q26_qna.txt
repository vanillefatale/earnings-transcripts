[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ed Kelly with Wells Fargo.

Edward Kelly
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to just start on fuel. I mean, obviously, the backdrop has been challenging. You've been outperforming. Can you just maybe talk a bit about the sustainability of that? And then Q3 is off to a good start. I mean it seems like rack prices have helped. Do you expect margins to just kind of revert back in short order? And then stepping back on all this, has anything changed fundamentally either with your approach here or the competitive backdrop that we should be aware of?

Stephen Bramlage
Senior VP & CFO

Ed, this is Steve. I'll maybe start on a couple of those. Certainly, nothing has changed with our approach, maybe start with that. I think some of the results that the team has had so much success delivering or directly related to how consistent we have been with our approach of trying to balance profitability and volume to the pad. They've done an excellent job of having consistent offer available to guests. And we firmly believe that contributes, for sure, to the sort of success that we've had.

Our fly track around our performance relative to the rest of the market begins with the store. And so the fact that the vast majority of our guests are coming to the store to go inside the store. 3 out of 4 of our transactions don't involve the purchase fuel gives us a lot of stickiness with those guests. Our guests, we believe, are a little less elastic than the average guest because they're already coming to the pad for the inside and store offer. So that has certainly helped our outperformance relative to the market that we're in.

As it relates to the seasonality of margins, I guess, is how I would address the question. Generally speaking, the winter for us, the third and fourth quarters, we're going to have seasonally lower margins than we do in the first half of the year. That's been the case for a while. We don't have any reason to expect that, that would be significantly different. But beyond the recognition of what happens seasonally, we really don't prognosticate around what's going to happen with forward-looking margins and beyond what the November experience has been.

Edward Kelly
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And then maybe just a quick follow-up on OpEx, up 4.5% on a same-store basis, which is a little higher than maybe what we expected. Can you just maybe speak to that quickly and how we should be thinking about the back half?

Stephen Bramlage
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Listen, our full year around expectations, full year expectations are unchanged. We did not change the 8% to 10% expectation for full year total OpEx. And so we are pretty much where we thought we would be exiting the first half of the year related to OpEx.

The timing of lapping the Fikes transaction is going to naturally step down the year-over-year change that we'll experience in OpEx in the second half of the year, and we're trying to give some visibility into that with the third quarter expectation of mid-single digits. We've been -- we've had a very long success run here quarter-wise of reducing same-store labor hours in the store. They were flat this year -- or this quarter, I'm sorry. That's very consistent with our expectations as eventually, we were going to come to the end of that multiyear effort to literally drop hours to the bottom line. With the promotions that we had in the store, especially the pizza promotions on Saturdays, we prudently added some labor back into the store.

And so it's kind of how we ended up flat with the same-store labor hours. But total OpEx, very consistent with our expectation beyond what we enumerated in the press release. There were some miscellaneous things, higher insurance costs, higher utility costs, legal was a little bit higher for us, advertising was a little bit higher. But by and large, I think total OpEx performance very consistent with expectations.

And the next question will come from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.

Ryan Bulger
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

This is Ryan Bulger on for Chuck here. Good to talk to you today. My question was going to be on the mix dynamic as you see these CEFCO stores roll into the base -- the comp base next quarter. Obviously, we've been talking about the impact on margins for a while, but I was just wondering if you could speak to anything you would expect to see in terms of how that would play out with the mix differences there, traffic and ticket, et cetera, and any impact that could have on comps as they roll into the base next quarter?

Darren Rebelez
President, CEO & Board Chair

Yes, Ryan, this is Darren. Clearly, the CEFCO stores are carrying a lower margin than the Casey's stores, both in prepared foods and in grocery and general merchandise. And that's because there's still CEFCO stores. They're not Casey's stores yet. Now that effort in terms of rebranding will start to kick off in earnest at the beginning of the calendar year.

We'll start converting the -- their larger stores that have kitchens in them already. Those are a little bit easier from a conversion standpoint. And then we'll -- once we get those done, then we'll start to convert the other stores. So we would expect that, that trajectory will change a bit on the prepared food side, in particular, once we get those kitchens in and they're rebranded to Casey's and they get our full assortment with private label and all the rest.

So we expect that margin to accrete over time. But as it stands right now, their margin rate in prepared foods is about half of what the mothership Casey's prepared foods margin is. So it is going to have an impact. I was really proud of the team this quarter in terms of managing the rest of the business, whether it's through cost of goods management, waste management and overall execution so that we mitigated that impact from the CEFCO stores onto the overall Casey's portfolio.

Ryan Bulger
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Yes. No, I was just curious if there'd be anything on the comp side as they roll into the comp base next quarter.

Darren Rebelez
President, CEO & Board Chair

Well, as we roll through, I mean, we haven't done that math yet, but I mean, there will certainly be an impact when they blend it in and there was an impact to the margin. So as we cycle over that, we'll see that. It should blend up a little bit, but we'll have to see when we get there.

And the next question will come from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.

Bonnie Herzog
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

All right. I had a question on your guidance. You did update your EBITDA guidance for this fiscal year, which is great to see, especially considering the strong results in the first half. But your guidance does still imply a sequential deceleration in EBITDA growth in the second half. So just hoping to hear some of the drivers of that. And then as you mentioned, you lapped the Fikes acquisition in November, but is there anything else contributing, I guess, to the implied deceleration in growth?

Stephen Bramlage
Senior VP & CFO

Bonnie, this is Steve. Maybe I'll just start with that. It's obviously been a very strong first half of the year for us and that played a part in this. But as it relates to the second half, specifically, we've tried to be pretty clear with people just mechanically the way the math has worked, right? We're not going to -- we do not expect the same absolute level of year-over-year EBITDA growth in the second half that we had in the first half just because we already have Fikes sitting in the base now.

There's really no change in expectation for us from the mothership performance per se. And the Fikes performance is generally on plan as well. And so I don't -- we're not trying to message any different expectation for kind of second half experience vis-a-vis first half experience other than mechanically, right? The math is naturally going to come down just because we have a higher number in the prior year second half period.

Bonnie Herzog
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up just because Fikes' acquisition has been a year. Can you just remind us your M&A strategy, where you're at and sort of what the market is like right now? Obviously, it's still very fragmented. Just any color there would be helpful in terms of what you're seeing and how actively you're potentially pursuing further M&A?

Darren Rebelez
President, CEO & Board Chair

Yes, Bonnie, this is Darren. We're -- we really haven't had any change in our strategy or our approach to M&A. As you know, we focus on a small deal kind of tuck-in acquisitions and that's sort of normal course. We have our dedicated M&A team that is on that full time. And we're seeing good results from that group and very consistent with what we've expected.

The larger type of M&A is more opportunistic and those are fewer and further between typically. And for us, it's not just a matter of buying something for the sake of buying it. If we need the right level of asset quality that we can -- we're able to put our kitchens into those stores and really run our play. So while we do see a lot more out there than we are willing to buy because they're just not the right quality for us. There is some activity out there. We are participating in some of those processes, but again, we set a fairly high bar for ourselves in terms of the asset quality. So we'll probably say no to more things than we ever say yes to.

And our next question will come from Bobby Griffin with Raymond James.

Robert Griffin
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Congrats on a solid first half. Darren, I just wanted to maybe circle back on the OpEx side, in particular, the same-store OpEx. And you guys, as you noted, have done incredible work on the hours basis, but maybe that's in the later innings. So when we look at like the year-to-date same-store OpEx of, call it, averaging out around high 3s, is that the right level for this business going forward with the store growth plans and kind of the expansion opportunities you have across Texas and whatnot? Or do you still think there are opportunities to maybe push that down to closer to 3 or high 2s on a same-store basis?

Darren Rebelez
President, CEO & Board Chair

Well, Bobby, we haven't guided beyond this year, so I'm not going to really try to forecast that right now. I would say that, like I said the last couple of quarters, I think a lot of the hour reduction work has largely been completed.

Now having said that, that work is never done, to be clear. We have a team that's dedicated to looking at in-store processes and always striving to become more efficient. But I would say at this stage, a lot of that will be fine-tuning and tweaking as opposed to larger reductions in labor hours.

The other thing I'd remind everybody about in this quarter in particular, our traffic was up 1.5%. Our whole pie sales were up 8% in units. And so as we grow the business on a same-store basis, there's a natural inflection point where some more labor needs to get added into the stores to meet the demand.

At the same time, we've had the highest overall satisfaction scores from our guests than we've ever had in this most recent quarter. So I don't want to get overly fixated on the labor number or on the OpEx number per se. We certainly manage it and we keep it close. But I think the combination of driving traffic, delivering outsized growth in our highest-margin categories and having a really great overall satisfaction scores from our guests is a really winning combination and very hard to do in retail, and we're doing it right now.

And so that's what we're really focused on. And when our gross profit dollar growth is growing at the pace it is, our EBITDA growth is growing at the pace it is, that's how we know we're doing it the right way. And so we're very comfortable with where we are at this point from an OpEx perspective.

Robert Griffin
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Understood. Very helpful. And then maybe just as my follow-up on a different subject. Alternate nicotine, there were some obvious manufacturer promotions during the quarter. But just curious, as you and the team have set out on the new calendar year, what are your expectations from promo activity in that category? Do you continue to expect it to be growing from a promotional basis or see higher promo potential going forward?

Darren Rebelez
President, CEO & Board Chair

Yes. I'm not sure about the promotional activity going forward. We'll still have more work to do with the manufacturers to understand how they're thinking about that as well. What I would say though is that overall, that category has been growing really fast over the last few years as volumes in combustible cigarettes go down. And so we would expect that, that trend will continue and as combustibles continue to erode and more people seek other nicotine alternatives for them.

And right now, that business is working well for us. I think we shared a couple of quarters ago that we reset all of the back bars in our stores to reduce the space allocated to combustible cigarettes and increase the space available for those nicotine alternatives really to meet the guest need where they are. And that play is working well for us. So we expect that longer-term trend to continue.

And our next question will come from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.

Charles Cerankosky
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

Great quarter. Could you talk about the declining cost of the gallon of gasoline and your customers' behavior in store? You said earlier that 3 to 4 store visits don't include gasoline, but is there an interplay between declining cost of fuel and, say, more prepared food store visits and bigger prepared foods purchases? And also, how about the influence of lower gas prices on your in-store promotions?

Darren Rebelez
President, CEO & Board Chair

Yes, Chuck. Clearly, any time we have lower absolute fuel prices that leaves guests with more discretionary income and dollars to spend. So we always like that scenario. But what I would say more broadly is that I think guests, in general, are just being a little more discerning about where they spend their money because there's a lot of other cost pressures outside of our stores that folks are dealing with right now.

And so what we're seeing is people are appreciating the value proposition that they experience at Casey's. And we see it in a couple of different areas. When you look at our whole pie business, as an example, when we run promotions, we get great uptake on the promotions, which would speak to the value, but we also see that people are trending more towards higher-priced items, so specialty pizzas as opposed to single topping pizzas. So those are more expensive, but they're getting the right value equation, the quality of the product and the price.

Same with our bakery category where people are trading up to multi packs versus single items. Those costs more, but on a per unit basis, those are less. So we think that people are really picking and choosing where they're going to spend their money and where the best intersection of quality and value come together is where people are really spending their money. And so low fuel prices certainly help, but I think a more robust in-store offer and getting that value equation right is probably the bigger driver of the results inside the store.

Good luck in the second half.

And our next question will come from Pooran Sharma with Stephens.

Pooran Sharma
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Maybe just wanted to peer more into cheese. Could you maybe update us on how much you have hedged? I think last quarter, you said you were about 70% locked up for the year. Just wondering if there's any update to that?

Stephen Bramlage
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Pooran, this is Steve. We continue to chip away at locking in favorable rates -- favorable prices for ourselves, but the team is really doing a good job of staying on top of that and being advantageous for us. So as we sit here today, we're about 80%, 8-0 percent locked for the next 4 quarters, so the second half of this fiscal year and the first half of what would be our fiscal '27. And we only lock something in if it's either favorable on a year-over-year cost basis or neutral. And so we're generally neutral or favorable on 80% of what we think we need to buy here for the next 4 consecutive quarters.

Pooran Sharma
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Great. I appreciate the color there. I guess on my follow-up, maybe just wanted to peer into guidance here and understand that seasonally, second half does step down from first half. But just given your commentary earlier on how November is trending fuel margin-wise, would it be fair to assume kind of more of a 3Q weighted split for the second half? So like maybe, let's say, like a 55-45 split in 3Q and 4Q, just given the favorability in fuel margins you've seen in November?

Stephen Bramlage
Senior VP & CFO

Listen, I think it would not be wise for me to go there. I think it's fair to assume that we were low 40s CPG for the month of November, and we'll probably leave it at that. I think historically, you can look at kind of a weighting between Q3 and Q4, and that's probably as good of a crystal ball as anybody would have around kind of how those quarters seasonally will behave.

Darren Rebelez
President, CEO & Board Chair

Yes. Pooran, I would just add that there's a lot that can happen in the fuel market from a commodity standpoint that's 100% out of our control. So what happens in November is really no indicator of what could happen in January. So we kind of play that one month at a time.

And the next question will come from Benjamin Wood with BMO.

Benjamin Wood
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

This is Ben on behalf of BMO and Kelly Bania. First, we just wanted to start with, could you give us an update on what the last 12-month EBITDA contribution was from CEFCO and maybe how that came in relative to your internal plan?

And then following up on kind of Bonnie's question. As we think about the composition of new store growth over the next 12 months, is that more NTIs or acquisitions? And then can you just walk us through how you're thinking about the potential returns more recently on your new-to-industry builds versus your potential acquisitions?

Darren Rebelez
President, CEO & Board Chair

Yes, Ben, I'll go ahead and start with the store growth piece, and I'll let Steve talk about CEFCO EBITDA. The store growth, we expect always a balance between new-to-industry and M&A. And so typically, when we set our new store goal for the year, we'll -- we kind of go into it planning for a 50-50 split. Now acquisitions can be a little bit lumpy. So we -- that number is usually wrong. But we go into it with that expectation and that plan, and we have the ability to do that.

If acquisitions run a little bit hot, then we usually throttle back the new-to-industry builds and get to our target and then that allows us to land bank for the situations where maybe acquisitions slow down a little bit, then we have the ability to flex the other way and accelerate new-to-industry build so we can maintain that consistent ratable growth.

So that's kind of how we view store growth from a return standpoint. We're always looking to achieve that mid-teens return after a few years when the stores start to mature. We have a long track record of achieving that. And we're really format agnostic, meaning whether that's a new to industry or an acquisition, we still have the same return expectations either way. Steve?

Stephen Bramlage
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Listen, what I would say on Fikes is we're right where we thought we would be. So our -- they're on plan for us. The plan is very consistent with kind of the pro forma assumptions that we had at the time we bought them. LTM is a little misleading. I'm not going to go there just because if you think of the first 2 quarters that we and Fikes, a lot of deal costs there. It was kind of a wash from an EBITDA basis for the second half of last fiscal year. But for this fiscal year, there -- we said that would be EBITDA accretive, healthy EBITDA accretion it is, would not be EPS accretive because of the interest that is still the case.

We continue to realize synergies primarily from fuel and SG&A as we sit here at this point in time, to Darren's earlier comment, the biggest group of the $45 million of synergies were ultimately trying to get is going to come from inside the stores and that's dependent on the timing with which we can remodel the stores.

So we won't -- will certainly not fully realize synergies this fiscal year, and that was never the expectation. But right where we thought it would be well on our way to ultimately getting to $89 million, $90 million of kind of fully synergized EBITDA, but we won't see all of that this fiscal year because of the timing of remodels.

Benjamin Wood
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Great. And then just as a follow-up, could you give us an update on what the latest thinking around your wing test? And then as you're thinking about timing of broader rollout, what are you guys looking for at this point? Are you still trying to refine the offering or the labor? Or are there calendar events like the Super Bowl or March Madness that might be a little bit more conducive to a broader launch?

Darren Rebelez
President, CEO & Board Chair

Yes, Ben. With the wings, like we've talked about, we still had some menu refinements that we're working on. Some procedural gaps we were trying to close. I think a lot of that work has been wrapped up where we've got some new flavor profiles that we just literally in the last week got back into the test stores, and we've broadened that store base a little bit to make sure we've got that right.

So we're -- I'd say a lot of the development-type work, we think, is largely done. We're validating that as we speak, and then we would proceed to start rolling out. So we haven't really announced the time line for that just yet. But I think that, that work is well underway. And so I think we're getting closer to the finish line there.

And the next question will come from Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Bradley Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Congrats on a strong quarter here. I want to first ask a big picture question about competition. This is something that comes up a lot in our conversations with investors about the growth of many of the private convenience stores. It seems like your results are clearly very insulated today, but I was wondering, Darren, if you could talk a little bit more about your confidence level in your insulation from some of that competition?

Darren Rebelez
President, CEO & Board Chair

Yes. Look, I think from a competitive standpoint, we have a little bit of a mixed bag. And what I mean by that is, yes, there are certainly some rural areas where we don't face a lot of the larger regional players that you're referring to.

We do have some of those larger regional players that we compete with every single day in some of our larger markets. I'll just use our home market of Des Moines, Iowa, as an example. It's probably one of the most competitive convenience store markets in the country.

And so we face 3 of those regional competitors as we speak in this market, and we performed exceptionally well here. We have that in a number of different markets, Texas, in Missouri, in Illinois. So I feel very comfortable in our ability to compete at the highest level with the regional players in the industry. And we have a differentiated offer. They do well at what they do, and we do well at what we do and those things aren't always the same. But I think we can look market-by-market where we have that more intense competition, and we do very well there.

Bradley Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. And if I could ask a follow-up on the state of the consumer, this has been an unusual quarter with the government shutdown and impact on SNAP. Curious if there was anything that you've seen in your business from a consumer perspective.

Darren Rebelez
President, CEO & Board Chair

I shared a little bit before about what we're seeing more broadly with the consumer. With respect to SNAP, SNAP is a very low percentage of our business. It's a little bit less than 2% of our sales are SNAP eligible. So we really -- the government shutdown, while unfortunately, really didn't have much of an impact on our business at all that we could discern from the numbers.

[Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Mike Montani with Evercore.

Michael Montani
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Just wanted to ask if you could unpack a little bit further some color, Darren, on state of the consumer and the K-shaped economy and in particular, I guess, with guide, it seems to imply about 50 bps of decel for the back half of the year, even though compares get a bit easier optically into the fourth quarter. And we thought you could have like 20 to 40 bps of tailwind from CEFCO stores getting into the comp. So just wanted to understand maybe if you could break out how the comp progressed over the quarter, a little more color about what you see in November. And then just some high-level commentary about that consumer.

Darren Rebelez
President, CEO & Board Chair

Yes. I guess, as we saw the comp progress through the quarter, it's really -- that trajectory was more a reflection of the comps we are cycling. So it kind of stepped down August, September, October. But when you look at the 2-year stack, it really was the other way, it accelerated.

So we had a very tough comp in October, and we cycled that. And that was probably our lowest comp sales month of the quarter from an inside perspective. But like I said, on a 2-year stack basis, we were about 6.5% last quarter. We were 7.5% this quarter, so I feel really good about the strength of the business and the trajectory it's on.

From a consumer perspective, again, I think -- and we've done some research on this. There's sentiment out there among consumers and then there's -- how they behave. And I think broadly speaking, if you look at different income cohorts, the middle and upper income cohorts are feeling fairly good about the economy.

There's some that have a negative view, but the majority would have either a neutral or positive view of the economy. The majority in those cohorts would feel at least neutral or more financially secure. The lower income is under more pressure from both of those perspectives. But they also say that they intend to maintain their visit frequency to convenience stores. So that's encouraging for us.

And again, what the actual behavior we're seeing in the stores is that they're still coming as frequently as they were as evidenced by our traffic increasing over the quarter. They're still buying as evidenced by our same-store sales performance relative to others in the space, but they are being more discerning about where they spend the money and how they spend it. And I think for us, with our prepared food proposition, in particular, it represents a really strong value relative to other alternatives out there, particularly in the QSR space. And so we're finding more people gravitate to us because of that strong value proposition and we continue to maintain that. So I feel very good about the spot we're in right now from a guest perspective.

Michael Montani
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

We had just done a deep dive actually on your last point about the share gain potentials for prepared meals where you all stood out positively. And I was curious if there's anything you could add that helps to bridge us to the chicken wings in terms of LTOs or other innovations down the pipeline?

Darren Rebelez
President, CEO & Board Chair

Well, we certainly think that the wings have the potential to create another occasion for the guests, and I would expect that from a quality and pricing perspective to really represent a great value proposition for the guests. And that's the feedback we're getting so far in the test market. So I would expect that to perform well when we go to a broader rollout.

And again, our pizza proposition has always been there. People are -- people recognize us for that. And as they become more value conscious, they're gravitating more towards us. And so again, relative to comparable quality products out there and we compete more with QSR from a quality perspective, our value is much stronger than most out there and it's resonating with guests.
