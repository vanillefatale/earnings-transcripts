[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is going to come from the line of Heather Jones with Heather Jones Research.

Heather Jones
Heather Jones Research LLC

Congratulations on a solid quarter. I wanted to ask about -- so given where current spot prices are for eggs. In the past, that would have translated to Cal-Maine generating losses at the EPS line. I was just talking about the changes that you all have made in the portfolio over the last few years to push into prepared foods and the higher percentage on cost-plus type models. Just wondering if you could walk through how you think about the earnings power or the earnings trajectory in depressed egg markets like this?

Sherman Miller
CEO, President & Director

This is Sherman, and thank you for that question. And as you know, we don't give specific guidance, but I'll touch on each of those, especially something that we've been working on for a long time, and we've had double-digit growth, and we believe that will continue. Prepared foods is exciting for us, and it's performing. We've committed to already a 30% growth over the next 18 to 24 months, and we're excited about also additional growth there, whether it's organic or M&A in the future.

And also the hybrid pricing, we talked about it last quarter that there's trade-offs on the higher side, but the real benefit happens in lower markets. So the point that you hit on is valid. And the real key there is us supporting our customers' go-to-market strategy and being a trusted supplier for the long term, and we believe that each of these will continue to improve our mid-cycle performance. Max, do you want to add anything there?

Max Bowman
VP, CFO, Treasurer, Secretary & Director

Sherman. I think you covered it, but what you said in your remarks about we're a different company than where we were the last time the market was at these levels, and you highlight those things just the growth we've had, even stronger balance sheet, more diversification, the growth of prepared foods, the continued emergence of specialty. All of those things, I think, make us a stronger, more durable company going forward.

Heather Jones
Heather Jones Research LLC

Okay. And just to follow up on that, and I know there are always tail risk and things that could happen. But given these changes, do you think Cal-Maine is a position that it can weather down markets like this, without generating losses given these changes?

Sherman Miller
CEO, President & Director

Once again, Heather, we don't give guidance, but Max just hit on the real strengths that make us completely different than what we were at last time we saw these market conditions, our balance sheet certainly is positioned better than it's ever been. And the growth that we've had, we've been very strategic to focus that growth in specialty eggs and also prepared foods, which carry a lot of weight in these lower market conditions.

And then on top of that, the hybrid pricing, we think, is going to be very beneficial to us. So in a much better position than we've ever been, Heather. And those prepared foods, and Heather, as we said before, prepared foods runs a little bit countercyclical. They're going to benefit from a lower egg market. So that's just another strength I think that we didn't have before.

Our next question comes from the line of Pooran Sharma with Stephens.

Pooran Sharma
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Wanted to start off with the prepared foods segment. Understanding you're making some adjustments there. So lighter volumes, maybe a little bit higher cost until the end of the year is what I'm understanding. You saw gross margins for that segment come down roughly 3% to around 19.6%. Is that a right kind of level to think about for the rest of this year? Or what kind of color can you give us in regards to gross margin for prepared foods?

Sherman Miller
CEO, President & Director

Thank you for that question. Prepared foods, we gave guidance right out of the gate with Echo Lake that we're looking at a 19% EBITDA margin. And we still think that holds true. There was some slippage in this quarter for the reasons you mentioned us preparing for a stronger future.

And there will probably be a little additional slippage to that during the next quarter. But the year in a whole, we're still feeling good about the 19% EBITDA margin. So once again, well worth the time of us pulling back and preparing for the future, this growth of 30% over the next 18 to 24 months is really exciting to us. And Max, what would you add to that?

Max Bowman
VP, CFO, Treasurer, Secretary & Director

I think you covered it.

Pooran Sharma
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Great, great. I guess my follow-up would be, and you guys have talked about the M&A pipeline in the past, maybe opening up when egg markets are depressed. But just given your broader expansion into prepared foods, do you think that this would limit your opportunity or your M&A pipeline? Because I would think that for these businesses, a lower egg market would mean higher earnings potential and potentially higher valuation. So I just wanted to get your take on the broader M&A pipeline opportunity given the depressed egg markets and given the change in your business.

Sherman Miller
CEO, President & Director

Pooran, the attractiveness to that prepared foods business is tied back to stability and away from kind of what you're talking about the Easter famine. So we don't necessarily think that will be a huge influence to us. Growth is broader than it's ever been, all remaining egg centric to our core, but now growth in conventional specialty prepared foods, possible ingredients feeding prepared foods and even prepared foods brands are all possible avenues of growth for the future. So we will continue to use a very disciplined model to evaluate acquisitions and move forward at the right pace. Max?

Max Bowman
VP, CFO, Treasurer, Secretary & Director

Again, you covered it well, Sherman, I'll leave it there.

Our next question comes from the line of Veronica Augustin with Goldman Sachs.

Leah Jordan
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

This is actually Leah Jordan with Goldman. So the shift to specialty eggs and prepared foods is really the key part of your story here going forward. And it looked great on the quarter today. But just how are you thinking about capacity growth for specialty eggs over time? And given the Clean Egg acquisition we saw this quarter, how do you think about M&A versus organic growth to continue that capacity expansion? And ultimately, any color on how we should think about the cadence of the mix shift in your sales towards specialty over the longer term?

Sherman Miller
CEO, President & Director

As you said, our specialty eggs and prepared foods is exciting, made up 46% of our net sales for the quarter. And we've seen double-digit CAGR type growth in specialty eggs. We look forward to continuing to drive to those same type growth metrics and longer term, we can definitely see specialty eggs making up greater than 50% of our total shell egg net sales. So when you pair that with the 30% growth that we're targeting in prepared foods, we think it lends well to much more stable earnings here in the future.

Max Bowman
VP, CFO, Treasurer, Secretary & Director

Leah, you brought up the Clean Egg acquisition. That was a small, but very timely important acquisition for us. I mean if you look at the description we gave, it's composed of 677,000 brown cage-free and free-range layers and [ pullets ] all specialty. We have market growth planned occurring now and getting those eggs at this time and for what we anticipate upcoming was very important and critical to the continued growth of that specialty business.

Leah Jordan
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

That's very helpful. And just a follow-up on the prepared foods discussion just given the investments underway. Any more detail around the progress of the optimization and expansion efforts so far? Any -- and as well as any more color on just the related higher costs that we should think about in the back half of this year relative to kind of what we saw this quarter? And just as those investments come online kind of over the next 12 to 18 months, how should we think about that kind of cadence of the growth trend there?

Sherman Miller
CEO, President & Director

You pointed out the important piece that is a 18- to 24-month project, and we've announced the CapEx piece of it at $36 million for that 30% growth in the interim of pulling back some lines, so that we can get all of our automation and all of our different lines in place. There's some volume efficiency penalties we received from that. But growth long term is certainly going to be good and all at the same time, still believing we'll hit that 19% EBITDA margin that we initially talked about.

And we're confident that we can continue over the long term to grow that business is what we call out when we acquired Echo Lake at that 9% to 10% CAGR. So again, we talked about in the first quarter about sort of letting it run. Let's see what it can do, and then we kind of assessed and now we're making the changes that we think position us the best for the long-term and for long-term growth and success in prepared foods.

Our next question comes from the line of Ben Klieve with Benchmark StoneX.

Benjamin Klieve
The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division

Congratulations on a good result here in a very dynamic period. First question is on the specialty volume. I'm wondering if you can hone in on specialty volumes within the second quarter. They were basically flat, given that -- they're basically flat and you noted that the small acquisition you had in the quarter and plus a general upward trend in specialty volumes. So I'm wondering if you can kind of break down the puts and takes that led to specialty volumes being, again, kind of roughly flat in the quarter.

Sherman Miller
CEO, President & Director

Ben, specialty last year was a tremendous year. So we're making a very tough comparison. If you remember, conventional eggs became extremely tight that put a lot of demand on specialty eggs. So to be flat is a huge win, we believe, and especially specialty eggs now accounting for 44% of total shell egg sales. I did mention the free-range and pasture-raised both had double-digit growth, both in dollars and dozens. We don't formally break down that category. But as a whole, specialty eggs are solid in that the double-digit CAGR that we've been seeing, we think the mechanism is in place for us to continue to do that.

Max Bowman
VP, CFO, Treasurer, Secretary & Director

Yes. I mean the comparative quarter is a tough part there. And just to expand a little further on what Sherman said, when conventional eggs are selling for higher than specialty, of course, the consumer is going to move towards specialty because they perceive it as a bargain. And that was the case that we had last year. That is totally turned around in this quarter, we're reporting and today, but yet we held on to flat volumes. And we still feel good and have said that we believe we can have double-digit specialty growth over time. So despite very difficult market comparison, we still have a lot of confidence in where our specialty business is and where it's going.

Sherman Miller
CEO, President & Director

One additional point, Max, is we do participate across every major specialty egg subcategory, which means that we're serving all customers interested in specialty. So regardless of which type of specialty egg they're interested in, we take pride in producing that.

Benjamin Klieve
The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division

Very good. That's very helpful across the board. One more for me and then I'll get back in queue. Is this dynamic that you've talked about regarding pricing of commodity eggs and kind of evolving that from the market-based -- purely market-based to -- more towards cost plus contract base, however, you want to characterize it? Can you talk about kind of the receptivity of your retail customer for this dynamic like today in the face of kind of normalized egg pricing versus even several months ago when prices were elevated? I mean I would expect that the retailers are maybe less excited to engage in this conversation today than they were, but I'm wondering if you can elaborate on that dynamic in any way.

Sherman Miller
CEO, President & Director

Yes, be glad to. It really all centers on the particular customer's go-to-market strategy, whether they're a high-low customer or whether they're an everyday low price, they have different needs. And so that's the way these pricing structures are geared. And I think the model is performing exactly like there's supposed to be for the customer. It gives them some high side protection, which is very important. And then also during these type periods, there's some benefit on the low side for us, which once again ties back to our mid-cycle earnings performance. So Max, what would you add to that?

Max Bowman
VP, CFO, Treasurer, Secretary & Director

I think you nailed it. I mean, it's just that long-term relationship, I think your thoughts are generally right Ben, but someone points out, different customers have slightly different priorities.

And the other thing that was mentioned in some of our prepared remarks is just the reliability of supply. And what we're trying to do for the long term is demonstrate that even in times of tough production last year and even this year, Cal-Maine continues to get the egg to the customers that they want and demand, and we're going to work with them to build those long-term relationships to support their pricing priorities.

Our next question comes from the line of Heather Jones with Heather Jones Research.

Heather Jones
Heather Jones Research LLC

I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of a step down we should anticipate for the prepared foods business for the second half of '26. Revenues came down significantly from Q1 to Q2, but some of that I would assume is due to egg pricing. But just how should we be thinking about the cadence of that business given its significance for your earnings for the second half?

Max Bowman
VP, CFO, Treasurer, Secretary & Director

Heather, I think we indicated that we would expect Q3 to have a continued pullback as we make these changes that we believe are good for the long term. So quarter-over-quarter, Q3 compared to Q2, I think you'll see slightly different results there. But we're confident that we're positioning the business for the long term and Sherman called out that growth that we're looking for over the next 18 to 24 months. And so you won't see as much of that in the third quarter. I think it starts emerging in the fourth quarter and then builds from there over the next 12 months or so.

Heather Jones
Heather Jones Research LLC

Okay. And then on the SG&A side, that came in somewhat higher than I was expecting for the quarter. And so just trying to think -- because last year, you had a contingency payment of like -- I think it was like $7 million. So the year-on-year increase was much more significant in Q2 than Q1 on an adjusted basis. So how should we think about SG&A expense for the rest of the year?

Max Bowman
VP, CFO, Treasurer, Secretary & Director

Well, you're calling out that contingency payment that was associated with [ favio ] in it we called that out. It was less this quarter than it was the same quarter last year, and that was just factor of egg prices being so high last year and down a bit now. I think that's sort of -- that continues through October of this fiscal year -- or excuse me, this calendar year, so we'll be following that and completing that at the end of -- sort of the end of '26. What was the other part of your question? I lost my train of thought.

Heather Jones
Heather Jones Research LLC

Just trying to figure out what kind of number should we be using like a run rate.

Max Bowman
VP, CFO, Treasurer, Secretary & Director

Yes. The other thing on the -- I think we called out increased professional fees. That seems to be the order of the day these days. So I think those numbers are going to run a little high. And then I think the other thing that drives SG&A is particularly specialty volume sometimes. And we still are confident specialty volumes are going to grow. And when you do that, you're going to have some promotional expenses and some fees associated with that, that will make SG&A be up a bit. I suspect as our retailers get more comfortable with supply that we will see more promotional activity in the back half of the year, which will likely drive some increased cost on the SG&A line there.

Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Mayhew with BMO Capital Markets.

Benjamin Mayhew
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Congratulations on the quarter. So it looks like you had a bit of a COGS benefit during the quarter as a result of lower priced outside egg purchases. So my questions are, has your volume outside egg purchases been on the decline sequentially as your company's supply recovers. Can you remind us how you plan to utilize outside egg purchases moving forward as supplies reach more normalized levels and egg prices are at $1? So what I'm really trying to get is -- like should we expect ongoing benefits in future quarters from outside purchases? Or is this more of like a one-off item?

Sherman Miller
CEO, President & Director

Ben, last year was certainly a historic year, and our customers had some periods of extreme orders if the stores we serviced had eggs and the store across the road did not, then our orders were growing exponentially. And we cover those orders through our production plus outside sales, and we have been reporting our percent produced of sales for quite a while. And we've moved back to that right at that 90% mark, and we do see that growing a few percentage points going forward just because we plan adding supply to be able to ensure that our customers have the eggs that they need.

So whenever we do that, that does force lower purchases on the outside, and that's some of the effect that you're seeing. But we plan our business well far ahead and short-term changes are difficult, whether up or down, but we do see that percent produced of sales to get back to that more of that 93%, 94%, 95% range here in the near term.

Max Bowman
VP, CFO, Treasurer, Secretary & Director

Yes. And Ben, just historically, we've called out before, those outside egg purchasers to a large degree, sort of gap filler or how we address changes in the market. And as Sherman said, if we were to see more disruption in the market for the same reasons as last year, that would likely drive additional purchases because we will do that to benefit our customers.

And as we said before, to prove up markets, if you will, and try to develop longer-term customers for the future. So it's a little bit opportunistic there, and it's a little bit based on what market conditions are. But no doubt, egg prices has been down. We called out the percentages related to the decrease in the egg price as well as the volume. And so both of those factors affect it. So at this point, with prices where they are, I think it will certainly be down. And as Sherman says, as our production comes more fully online, that should help mitigate it as well. But keep your eye for those other dynamics, it could drive more purchases as we go forward.

Benjamin Mayhew
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

And that's a good segue to my last question here, other dynamics. So do you have any thoughts on why we have seen a rapid -- such a rapid decrease in bird flu cases across the industry? Is there any one thing that industry players are doing that is protecting against the spread? Or do you chalk it up more to maybe luck?

Sherman Miller
CEO, President & Director

There's lots of ways of measuring that. If you're looking at just pure layer numbers, you would be correct. But if you look at what we think is a greater indicator and that's just presence of the virus, it's an absolute terrible situation. It's all over the U.S. And in bigger than that, it's all over the globe. Back in 2015, when we saw the virus disappear. We also saw it disappear on a global scale slightly before it did here. And all the indicators that it's a huge global presence since October 1, 26 countries are reporting High Path AI losses in poultry. And the number outbreaks is 496.

So the presence of the virus is extremely strong. 2025 was the worst year ever at 45.6 million layers in pullets that exceeded the next worst year of 2022 of $43.1 million. So Ben, it's very difficult to estimate the magnitude. But all the indicators of the problem are still there. And it is certainly the incidence rates in November of this year is as high as 2022, just not the high bird numbers because smaller flocks were affected.

And usually, whenever big losses occur, there's some type of precursor, whether it's a major wild bird dial or where it's a turkey population in an area or a commercial duck population something increases that overall virus load in an area before we see these large bird explosions. So unfortunately, Ben, I would say that we're still on pins and needles watching this virus.

Max Bowman
VP, CFO, Treasurer, Secretary & Director

I'd just add, I was reading last night a lead market analytics report that came out. And amongst the things he was doing in that report was sort of critiquing his own primarily forecasting ability over the last several years and how it was driven. But there are many points, and it's worth of reading if you have access to that.

But one of the things that he said, and I'll tie in to what Sherman said, the incidences are still there. So the potential is still there. And since '22, if you look at sort of the projections for flock numbers and those kind of things. For the most part, you've seen that they've been underestimated -- excuse me, they've been overestimated because of the influence of -- and the likelihood that we see for potential AI. So we don't know what the future brings, and always the past isn't necessarily the best predictor for the future, but it does inform it. And I think it's a worth consideration.
