[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the line of Wamsi Mohan from BofA.

Wamsi Mohan
BofA Securities, Research Division

I guess, to start, your free cash flow guide for next year is flat year-on-year despite the margin pressures you alluded to from increased memory pricing. What are some of the elements offsetting these headwinds in cash flows? And does the $2.9 billion in free cash flow include any cash restructuring charges? And I have a follow-up.

Karen Parkhill
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks, Wamsi, for your question. We obviously remain focused on driving value to our shareholders through strong free cash flow. And like we're doing with our earnings guide, we're taking a prudent approach to our expectations there, particularly the recently projected increase in memory costs. So at this point, we expect our free cash flow to be relatively flat, as you said, with slightly lower earnings, and that's offset by improvements in working capital primarily due to the favorable cash conversion cycle we have with the expectations of our growing PS business. We also expect CapEx and restructuring costs to be down slightly year-over-year. And I would just say on free cash flow, as always, if we can do better, we will.

Enrique Lores
CEO, President & Director

And yes, it includes the restructuring -- the funds of the restructuring activities.

Karen Parkhill
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And we expect for the year the restructuring cost to be roughly $250 million.

Wamsi Mohan
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. Okay. Great. And then maybe, Enrique, like we've seen plenty of memory cycles in the past. This one, it's fairly unprecedented in rate and pace of change. And I'm just wondering, as you think about the various strategies you're going to deploy to navigate this, how do you think about price elasticity in a somewhat weaker consumer market? How do you think about despeccing? And any other sort of strategies that HP could deploy in terms of being able to raise price without sort of impacting the demand elasticity, if that's at all possible? Like what are some of the things that you're looking at executing to limit this impact to what you quantified about $0.30 or so?

Enrique Lores
CEO, President & Director

Thank you. So as you said, this is not the first time we go through a situation like that, so the team have plenty of experience handling the situation. I think the first thing that helps us in this situation is our scale, and by using our scale, we have today a good supply position, thanks to the long-term agreements and the relationships we have with many suppliers. And we are using that also to qualify additional suppliers to mitigate this even further. We also can use the breadth of our portfolio to make sure that customers get the right configuration and to descale in those cases where it's possible to balance company profitability with experience from customers.

Something unique that we have this time is something that I have been mentioning before, which is the Workforce Experience platform. This is a tool that we deploy to our Commercial customers that allows CIOs to monitor the performance of individual users. And by using telemetry data that we have been capturing over time, we can make recommendations on what is the optimum configuration per customer because this will help us significantly for those customers that when we deploy the tool to make sure that they get the right solution and the right memory configuration.

And then what we have seen in the past in these situations from a demand perspective are usually the more low-end categories, those that are impacted and by managing our portfolio and shifting demand to the areas where we think we will have more product available and better configurations is an important way for us to manage that. And then finally, of course, pricing will be another tool to mitigate the impact, and we will use this as soon as we can, given the contracts and the different relationships that we have.

Our next question will come from the line of David Vogt with UBS.

Brian Luke
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

This is Brian Luke on for David. Just on the topic of higher memory prices, you talked about a number of actions you could take. Staying on the topic of pricing, now would you consider price increases across the entire portfolio? Or would you consider them more tactical in nature? And would you be able to quantify any price increases you'd be considering going forward? And then I have a follow-up.

Enrique Lores
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I would say we are going to be looking at it case by case, country by country, category by category. But the impact on memory cost is significant. I would say, it's going to happen across the board, but more selectively or higher or lower depending on specific situations.

Brian Luke
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then in regards to the Windows 11 refresh, you talked about us being roughly 60% of the way through. According to our checks, that's roughly in line, and you expect it to be a tailwind going forward in fiscal year '26. Do you expect it to be a tailwind for longer than that time period? And would you expect tariff considerations to be having an impact going forward?

Enrique Lores
CEO, President & Director

Yes, so you heard it right. We estimate that about 60% of the installed base have moved to Windows 11. We have seen the conversion happening faster in the enterprise space and also in North America. But the biggest opportunity now is going to be in SMB and in Europe and in Asia. And this is very consistent with previous processes.

In terms of the tailwind, if you think about what has been the conversion during the last quarter, has been about 10 points, but this can give you a prediction of for how long we think this is going to last, for sure for the first half of the year, but probably beyond that.

Karen Parkhill
Chief Financial Officer

We also have a catalyst of AI PCs being a continued uptick as we look ahead to -- we had about 30% or more than 30% of our shipments being AI PCs in the fourth quarter, and we expect that to be higher next year, 40% to 50%.

Operator

Our next question will come from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI.

Jyhhaw Liu
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

This is Irvin Liu dialing in for Amit. I wanted to understand the rationale behind the company cost savings initiative that was announced today. Since you recently completed the -- you already recently completed the Future Ready program, was this new initiative more of a response to high memory costs? Or should we view this as kind of a broader cost savings program in nature?

Enrique Lores
CEO, President & Director

Yes. We -- I actually started to talk about this in the last earnings call, so this was way before the memory cycle started. And this is really driven by the opportunity that we think AI is going to bring us to accelerate product development, improve customer satisfaction and also boost productivity.

Two years ago, we started to do some pilots on how AI could help us to drive these things, and during the last 2 quarters, we have been shifting from pilots to specific initiatives in areas where we can have significant impact. What we have learned is that we need to start from redesigning the process, and once the process -- once we know how the process could be redone using AI, using agentic AI can really have a very significant impact.

And this is why we think that really over the next years, this can have a very significant impact across the areas I mentioned before, faster product development, customer satisfaction and also productivity. And we have quantified productivity around $1 billion over the next 3 years, and this is really what we have deployed now and what we are working with the teams to deliver on.

Our next question will come from the line of Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan.

Joseph Cardoso
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik. Maybe just wanted to follow up on kind of the PS momentum or PC momentum you're thinking about or seeing going into 2026. I was curious if you could just flesh out the conviction here, particularly as we're cycling past the bulk of the Win 11 refresh. I know, [ Antonio ], you talked about 60% or 50% plus of the installed base moved over, and so there's some headroom there to continue. But interestingly enough, when you guys talked about the forecast for next year, it seemed like pricing was a bigger contributor for the next year relative to this year, where I think units were bigger. So I'm just curious like where you guys are seeing that dynamic play out and what's kind of the conviction behind it. And then I have a follow-up.

Enrique Lores
CEO, President & Director

Yes. So the conviction comes from the same drivers that we have seen driving demand during the last few quarters. We have an aged installed base of PCs that need to be refreshed. Of all the PCs that were bought 4, 5 years ago, we have the opportunity driven by the change to Windows 11, and we have seen that tailwind helping us during the last quarter. As you said, the conversion has been done to 60% of the installed base, so we have still close to 40% of the installed base to be converted especially in SMB and especially outside of North America, and this will be a tailwind now for several quarters. And we also see the opportunity to continue to improve the mix of AI PCs that has exceeded expectations that we had for the year.

So all these will be positive drivers. On top of that, our strategy is going to continue to be focused on premium categories as it has been during the last few quarters where we have made very significant progress, both in Commercial customers, Consumer customers and workstations, and we also have an opportunity to continue to drive attach of peripherals, attach of services. So all these kind of will help us to drive revenue growth faster than unit growth in '26.

Joseph Cardoso
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And then maybe a follow-up for Karen. So just curious if you could share any thoughts on how you're thinking about seasonality for next year. Seems like a lot of moving pieces with the company cycling past the tariffs of this year, maybe the bulk of the Windows 11 refresh this year and then kind of entering a dynamic memory pricing environment, just to kind of name a few of the things that are going on obviously. Anything we should keep on top of mind relative to maybe first half, second half dynamics relative to revenues? I know you talked about the margin implications as you kind of cycle past some of the inventory that you built on the memory side. But any other moving pieces we should think about as we're thinking about our models for next year in terms of some of the different dynamics we should be considering just given that we've been in somewhat of a volatile or moving pieces environment?

Karen Parkhill
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Joe. Happy to talk about that. So I did mention that we anticipate our revenue to be stronger in the second half of the year, and that's really just driven by normal seasonality as well as pricing as needed against the tariffs and the rising costs. When I say -- when you look at our margins, we expect our print operating margins to be in line with seasonality, where we see Q3 typically lower seasonally than the rest. And on PS, as we talked about, we expect our PS operating profit rate to stay in the 5% to 6% range in the first half of the year. But then with higher memory cost increases in our back half, we expect -- we said we expected our full year rate to be at the low end of our long-term 5% to 7% range. So given that, we could see Q3 and Q4 temporarily below that 5% range. But as you know, we're working to minimize that and ultimately mitigate the full impact. So if we can do better, we will.

When you think about it from an EPS perspective, we typically have EPS more stronger in the back half. But with the impact of memory in the back half of this year, you can think about EPS being more evenly weighted through the year. Hopefully, that helps.

Enrique Lores
CEO, President & Director

And maybe let me add a couple of comments on the memory side. As we said in our prepared remarks, we expect the major impact of the memory cost increases to impact the second half of the year. In fact, almost no impact in the first half given the inventories on hand that we have. I think it's important to have in mind that we are one of the first companies that are guiding for the full year, and the impact we really see on the second half, we don't see it in the first half.

Our next question will come from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.

Michael Ng
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I was wondering, Karen, Enrique, if you could just expand a little bit about the comment around the growing base of services, subscriptions and software that are more contractual in nature. Was that a comment more about Workforce Solutions or print subscriptions? I appreciate the highlight. Just if you could expand on anything that you're thinking about in the future, that would be helpful and how you would work to grow that type of business?

Enrique Lores
CEO, President & Director

Yes. It's coming across the board. So we have seen very solid growth, for example, in the Consumer Subscriptions side of Instant Ink and All-In. We mentioned that business is approaching $1 billion, which is really a significant milestone for this type of businesses. We have also seen very solid growth in the Workforce Solutions space, especially in PCs, in PCs as a service that has driven very significant growth during 2025 and that we expect to continue to see in 2026. And also our software businesses are having very strong performance, and I will let Karen make a few comments.

Karen Parkhill
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, I would just add that we're excited to drive even greater growth in value in the future with revenue that is less cyclical and more stable and higher margins. It's really an important focus for us as a company. And it means that as we innovate products and develop new business models around them, we'll be focused on driving more recurring revenue. And when we think about doing our capital allocation, too, this is going to be a priority focus for us.

But I would say it's not something that's going to change rapidly overnight. We see this as an important gradual transition, and we'll just continue to highlight it for investors.

Michael Ng
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Great. And if I could just follow up around the headwind for memory of $0.30 on EPS net of mitigations, what do you think the gross impact is? And what's your confidence level on the mitigations? Could it be better or worse? And then just as a quick follow-up, are you also seeing similar kind of tightness on [ PCB ] and kind of inflation related to that?

Enrique Lores
CEO, President & Director

Sure. So let me start on the quantification. We have shared enough numbers that you can calculate. We have shared that the cost of memory is between 15% and 18% of PCs. From there, you can calculate the gross impact that you will see is significantly bigger than the $0.30 that we are quantifying.

And we have fairly high confidence in the actions that we have put in place. In fact, we mentioned that we have been conservative in the guide for the full year and that based on the actions I described before, if we can do better, we will be better. But given that we are guiding the full year and we expect to see the majority of the impact in the second half, we thought it was important to be prudent at this point.

In terms of other components, when -- this is the area where we see the biggest impact, memories and storage. The rest of the space, we are confident, and we don't see any shortages at this point. And as I said before, even in the memory and storage space, we are in a good position from a supply perspective given the relationships and the contracts we have with our suppliers.

Our next question will come from the line of Asiya Merchant with Citigroup.

Michael Cadiz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

This is Mike Cadiz on behalf of Asiya Merchant of Citi. So my question is on AI PC penetration. So despite you hitting the 25% to 30% penetration ahead of schedule, how do you think that tariffs and now the elevated commodity costs have affected the expected trajectory towards the 50% in the coming years that you telegraphed?

Enrique Lores
CEO, President & Director

So we continue to be very optimistic about the penetration of AI PC. And as I mentioned before, as we will be prioritizing premium categories to and we will -- we will be working on the memory situation next year. The penetration of AI PCs, as I said before, is about 30% today as at the end of the quarter and is really driven by the additional value these PCs bring compared to the installed base and the fact that our customers want to be ready as soon as applications start taking advantage of the capabilities of these products.

Last quarter, I mentioned the work that we are doing with software companies to leverage those, and this work has continued, and we have continued to make progress. With the announcement that Microsoft made last week on the consumer side, the ability to manage PCs with voice, I think are going to be exciting, very exciting for our consumers. They have improved the tools that they have for other companies to take advantage of GPUs and MPUs in the devices.

We have made progress with other software companies like Adobe in leveraging those assets with more local vendors like Rakuten or -- in Japan to take the models and the systems that they have in the cloud and bring them to the edge, an announcement we made a few weeks ago. And we have also worked with smaller companies that drive very specific value, for example, in helping sales teams to be more efficient or in helping product managers to present better. All these are really helping to drive adoption.

And something we think very relevant is that we have deployed these solutions internally in HP with not only the PCs but with a curated set of applications, we have seen up to 17% of productivity improvement. And this is a very important value proposition for us but also for our customers.

Michael Cadiz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

And then as my follow-up, for both PC and print, would you mind talking about the customer and market reception to the pricing actions that you've taken and whether or not it's different between Consumer and Commercial and how you perhaps balance that with maintaining margins and share as well?

Enrique Lores
CEO, President & Director

Sure. The majority of -- I mean, if I look at print, we have done price actions both in the Consumer and Commercial space. In the Commercial space, probably because our -- most of our competitors are Japanese and they continue to have a very significant help from yen. We didn't see these changes happening across the board, and this is why we lost some share in Q4.

It didn't happen in Consumer, it didn't happen in Supplies, where we grew our share -- especially in Supplies where we grow our share. And in the PC space, our price increases have been smaller because the impact of tariffs so far has been smaller, and therefore, we haven't seen a strong reaction one way or another. Prices have grown year-on-year, quarter-on-quarter but less than what we have seen in other spaces.

Karen Parkhill
Chief Financial Officer

And even with this pricing environment, you're seeing us have strong revenue performance, both last quarter and for the full year. We expect that to continue.

Our next question will come from the line of Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.

Maya Neuman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

This is Maya Neuman on for Erik Woodring. Maybe just to start to build on some of your comments regarding your mitigation tactics for the memory cycle and your supplier relationships, could you quantify how many weeks of memory inventory you have on hand? And are suppliers willing to sign long-term agreements? And kind of just overall, where do you believe HP is most differentiated within the supply chain or has the greatest competitive differentiation versus peers to weather this memory cycle? And then I have a follow-up.

Enrique Lores
CEO, President & Director

Sure. I'm not going to share the specifics of the weeks of inventory we have. But I said before that given the inventory we have today, we are fairly well -- in a fairly good situation for the first half of the year. So this helps you to understand that it's not going to have a short-term impact. In terms of long-term agreements, we have long-term agreements with our key suppliers and the scale, the depth of our relationships are key assets when we go through situations like this.

As you know, also, after COVID, we made a lot of work to improve our operational processes within supply chain, both in terms of supply/demand matching, in terms of forecasting, and they will be very useful now as we need to go through this situation because it's not only about getting the memory, it's also about getting other supplies that will work with memory like processors, and it's about aligning demand to that. We did a lot of work during the last quarters of COVID to improve that. And the team is very experienced now in how to manage this situation.

Maya Neuman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. And then last question for me. If we take a step back and think about your overarching strategy in print, how should we think about it going forward? I understand we'll probably get more details at the Analyst Day. But it's obviously a secularly declining business, so you're also seeing operating income decline in print as well on a dollar basis, which I know a lot of actions around pricing, Big Ink, toner subscriptions, the graphics market are meant to protect. Is this a business where we should expect operating income growth? And if so, how do we get there on a sustainable basis?

Enrique Lores
CEO, President & Director

Yes. As we said, we will talk more about this in our Investor Day in a few months, but the strategy that we have been executing during the last year is not changing. Our goal continues to be to capture more value per customer and reduce the number of unprofitable customers, which we have been doing during the last year. Our shift or our doubling down on Big Ink is a consequence of that strategy as well. We see a big opportunity to grow profitable units in that space, while at the same time continue to accelerate and continue to drive the transition into subscriptions in this space. And we have been making very good progress both on the supply side and are also integrating printers in our All-In program.

In the office space, we see an opportunity to grow our share in profitable units and the new portfolio that we will be launching during 2026. And the work that we continue to do in cost will help us to achieve that goal. And then finally, on the industrial space, both -- especially in the graphics side, it's a business that has been growing during the last 9 quarters, and we expect it to continue to grow during 2026.

Our final question will come from the line of Mark Newman with Bernstein.

Mark Newman
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Yes, just following up a bit on the memory price environment. Thanks very much for clarity on the $0.30 impact. Just curious though, you mentioned that's mostly on the back half, so presumably, it's -- do you think if you just do the math, $0.30 on $3 or so annual earnings, so your impact is more than 10% on the back half. Considering, of course, you can pass through a lot of that with pricing, it seems like that -- it should be less given you have quite a few months to correct pricing. So just wondering if anything I'm thinking about wrong there. This seems like it may be conservative from you on the $0.30, but let me know if I'm thinking about that wrong.

And I also wanted to ask, does it have an impact on mix given how significant memory prices have moved? I mean could specs change, average specs of what you sell change? Could that also impact the AI PC dynamic considering the AI PCs typically have higher specs?

Karen Parkhill
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks for the question, Mark, and let me just talk about the $0.30 in the guide. I would just say, we remain focused on taking a prudent approach to our guidance. And particularly as we start a new year, we're setting our guidance at a level that we have a high confidence in meeting and hopefully exceeding. I would say we're taking that same prudent approach this year with the rising cost of memory, but we've already been implementing actions to mitigate. And I would note that we have a proven track record of managing challenges like this, and we are confident in the strength of our organizations and the partnerships that we've built to deliver the best possible outcomes. So while we have included that $0.30 in the guide, if we can do better, we certainly will. And your math is roughly right.

Enrique Lores
CEO, President & Director

And then finally, in terms of configuration, as I said before, we are going to be prioritizing those units where we see more margin for the company. And what we have seen in other cases is where volumes are more impacted, but more in the entry space, where customers are usually more sensitive to price.

And as Karen said before, we decided to take a conservative approach. We are guiding now the full year. We think the impact will be mostly on the second half, and we are taking a lot of actions to mitigate that impact. But given how fast things have unfold during the last few weeks, again, we thought it was better to be prudent at this age.

Operator

And that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Enrique for any closing comments.

Enrique Lores
CEO, President & Director

Perfect. And thank you, everybody, for joining today's call. We remain confident in our ability to lead the future of work through technology, and I'm really proud of the progress we have made across our priorities. We finished 2025 strong growing profit from the first half to the second.

In 2026, we intend to grow faster than the market. We have a significant opportunity to embed AI in everything we do and transform the company. The memory headwinds that we have been talking today, while material, are also temporary, and we are taking action. And we have managed, as we said also, such challenges before, and we have a lot of experience on how to handle that. So with a clear strategy and disciplined execution, we are focused on driving long-term value while managing these headwinds.

Again, thank you for joining today. And for those of you in the U.S., we wish you a very happy Thanksgiving holiday. Thank you.

This concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.
