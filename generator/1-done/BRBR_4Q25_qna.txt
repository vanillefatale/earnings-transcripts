[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.

Stephen Robert Powers
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Darcy, I think it's fair to say that a lot has changed over the last 6 months in your categories and around your business. Maybe just -- could you start off by summarizing what you've observed and how that's influenced your '26 plans as well as your updated long-term views. And why you believe the outlook you've landed on is the right one, both in the year ahead and longer term?

Darcy Davenport
CEO, President & Director

Sure. I would actually start with what has not changed. I think what has not changed is the momentum in the category. There is -- I mean, the household penetrate -- it's still a low household penetration category, call it 50% with a ton of upside. There -- I mean, you could actually argue there's more momentum in the category. And what has also not changed is Premier's position in the category. So we are the #1 brand, #1 household penetration, #1 repeat, strong national supply chain, et cetera. So I think those are kind of the mainstays. I would -- so I think what has changed is it's more competitive, which I think is expected. I mean the way I view the category in total is that there are -- they're kind of -- and I walked through some of this in my prepared remarks, but they are the leading brands, which include Premier, which represents about 50% of the category.

There are these insurgent and crossover brands, which represent about 10% of the category. And then there are declining legacy brands, which represent about 30% of the category, who have been kind of meaningful shared donors through the year. As I look forward, what we expect to see is the leading brands keep leading and winning. The insurgent brands are -- there's going to be some mix. There's going to be kind of a shake-up, where some will make it and some will not. And then the declining brands will continue to decline.

So as I look at our guidance and our plan for '26, I feel really good. We have a tough Q1. There's some unique dynamics going on with Q1 with -- in the club side of the business. We're lapping a period with fewer new entrants and one major club customer. And we're lapping some non-repeating promos in the other. So it's a tough quarter, but that does not represent the business. The last 3 quarters are much like every other quarter that we've had, which has strong, strong growth.

And the reasons to believe there is the category is healthy. We have strong plans. The rest of the business is growing very rapidly. We've got a couple of really exciting partnerships, like we have a partnership with this mass retailer that I talked about, which really is, I think, a sign of what we're going to see in other grocery accounts and then advertising hitting as well as innovation. So I think there is the reason to believe as well as my view on the category.

Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.

Andrew Lazar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Darcy, I remember last quarter, you did not yet have as much clarity as you wanted around the repeat rate for some of the new entrants or the insurgence that have come into the category, particularly at your largest customer. I'm assuming you at least have some additional clarity now on some of this. And I guess, more importantly, what that means for sort of the -- your expected shelf set, right? For the year ahead at your largest club customer. I was hoping you could maybe update us a bit on that dynamic. I think that was one of the main reasons why last quarter, you weren't yet in a position to sort of provide '26 guidance as I think many had kind of hoped at the time.

Darcy Davenport
CEO, President & Director

Yes, sure. So yes. As I said in my remarks, that one of the changes is that we do expect that our major club customer will keep that expanded set. So that is a change versus what we had assumed before. So we think that the competitive set will be bigger and remain the same. I think that we wanted to watch repeat rates. I would say we're continuing to monitor. I think what is clear is that not all of these kind of insurgent brands are going to make it.

There is definitely going to be a shakeout. These thresholds that you have to hit at these club customers are high. And so I think that we will continue to see sort of a rotation of different kind of smaller brands, bringing news, but also kind of just coming in and out. I would say what we have learned, we are -- our fifth pallet in that customer will -- as we expected, will be -- will transition out. The rest of our business is super strong. I think that what I've learned, and what we have learned is that I think that -- the category is strong, it's expandable.

I think that they're -- from an insurgent brand standpoint, there will be winners and losers, and it's really hard to hit those thresholds. I think that we are really well positioned versus consumption. When we look at the interaction between us and many of the competitors, we have a clear position and our repeat rates are only getting stronger. So -- and we're also source -- we are sourcing some volume from those competitors. So I think I feel really good about our business in the long term despite there's kind of a little bit of messiness in this quarter.

Our next question comes from Megan Clapp with Morgan Stanley.

Megan Christine Alexander
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I just wanted to ask about the club channel, again, maybe following up a bit on Andrew's question. There's been a lot of unique dynamics, not just here in the first quarter, but all year in the club channel. And clearly, it's an important channel for the category a bit more mature for you. But when we think about the acceleration that you talked about that you're going to see in mid-December and the kind of down 5% to up 9% or so embedded in the guide. How much is driven by the Club channel in particular? And can you just tell us what that means for what you're expecting for growth in the club channel this year? And how the various headwinds and tailwinds kind of shake out in your mind as you think about that channel.

Darcy Davenport
CEO, President & Director

Yes. So what we expect is that -- the growth is -- the major growth is largely coming from outside of the club channel. I mean we've been seeing stronger growth for many, many quarters from our FDM, the food, drug, mass and e-commerce channels. So that is where we see -- that's where we have kind of the most potential, and where we see kind of the most opportunity for the category as well as us. So what our guidance assumes is that the club comparisons get better throughout the quarters. But the growth is largely coming from the rest of the channels. So I think that -- and in our -- in my remarks, I talked about kind of the reason to believe just around distribution, merchandising, advertising and innovation.

Our next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI.

David Palmer
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Thanks for the commentary on your general areas of investment. A lot of us are going to be looking at the all-channel scanner data, the consumption data. I wonder how you're thinking about what we will see in that consumption trend through the rest of the fourth quarter. And I presume which will be a ramp into 2Q? How you're thinking what we would see based on what your plans are -- and to the degree that you can, can you tell us how you're factoring in increased competition that you see and perhaps some room for surprises and your innovation contribution to growth.

Darcy Davenport
CEO, President & Director

From a consumption standpoint, we are expecting, in November, we'll continue to see Tough Club comps and remember, we have that non -- that Club promotion that we are not recurring. So expect kind of slightly negative kind of low-single digits, continuing through November. What we start seeing when you'll start seeing an acceleration in sort of the back half of December as New Year. So we have the mass partnership, so kind of expect low double digits in all of December, but it will ramp up towards the end. And then that momentum will continue through kind of Jan, Feb, March and on. So there really is some unique things going on right now within the club channel, then ease out. Obviously, the nonrecurring-club promo is very specific in October and November. But after that, I think that what happens is that it continues to accelerate as we layer on these demand drivers.

David, what was the other question?

David Palmer
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Well, how you're thinking about increased competition being headwind, perhaps including some room for surprises there, but also contribution to growth, and how you're thinking about just the innovation giving you some help on some of the consumption numbers you're thinking about?

Darcy Davenport
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I would say that our guidance is very, I would say, it's prudent. It's conservative. It puts in assumptions around continued competition. And so I think it's one of the reasons why I feel really good about -- I feel really good about delivering the year quarter by quarter.

Next question comes from Brian Holland with D.A. Davidson.

Brian Holland
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

I wanted to maybe follow up on the conversation around compares over the balance of the year. I mean if I look at Premier Protein's consumption, a little bit softer in Q2 and Q3 prior year in club. Overall, consumption pretty strong throughout the year. So I know you did a longer promo event at your largest club customer this past August, September. So just a little more -- just a little better understanding about why, or how you view the compare as being easier over the balance of the year? And what level of visibility do you actually have into competitor shelf placement as we go through the year?

Darcy Davenport
CEO, President & Director

So I'll start, and then, Paul, if you want to add on anything? Yes, so our club comparisons do get easier. So if you remember, in our largest club customer, the expanded that started easing in Q3 and then expanded more in Q4. So we are lapping, so especially in Q1 and into Q2, we are lapping a period with kind of less competition. So the comps are more difficult in the front end. I think what -- as we move forward, I would say we have -- the visibility on competitive entrant is -- I mean, I would say, pretty good for the first half. And then we have -- I mean, we don't even know about our reset for the back half. Here's what I would say is -- as the #1 brand within the category, our retail partners are choosing us to figure out what they're going to do in this -- in their category.

So there's some exciting things going on. And I'm going to -- I referred to this in my remarks, but in several retailers, a club retailer as well as some major food retailers. They're testing higher traffic dials to move the category. And they're not just -- they're not moving the entire category. What they're deciding to do is they're selecting the best performing brands the ones that have the most mainstream appeal, and they're moving those into these new higher traffic sets. Obviously, that includes Premier Protein.

But some of the legacy brands will stay back in kind of the pharmacy. So that dynamic is not something they're testing it right now. So we're not seeing that necessarily make its way into consumption, but it will in the medium to long term, probably -- actually not even long term, medium term. So some of those dynamics are really exciting. And I think show you where the category is going, and whereas the #1 brand where we will be going.

Paul Rode
CFO, Treasurer & Principal Accounting Officer

So obviously, we had very strong distribution gains in fiscal '25. And so we'll obviously get the full year benefit of that in fiscal '26, including some pretty significant distribution gains in our fourth quarter, in particular at a mass retailer that reset shelf. And so obviously, we'll get a full year benefit of that reset as well, including -- in our first quarter, we have some innovation that's also shipping out. So as you kind of get into Q2 and beyond, some of that innovation will start shipping.

Q2 obviously is a very big pulse period for us of advertising. So we're stepping up our advertising, stepping up our merchandising, stepping up our promotional events, especially in FDM. And so those are the reasons we think that sales and consumption will accelerate as we move into Q2 and beyond with additional innovation hitting later in the year. So those are the big pieces for the reasons for why we believe consumption will accelerate as we move throughout the year.

Our next question comes from Thomas Palmer with JPMorgan.

Thomas Palmer
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I wanted to maybe bridge a little bit more on your EBITDA margin, down around 280 basis points year-over-year. You noted, I think, around 80 basis points from tariffs and your comments suggest maybe another 80 basis points for stepped-up advertising. So when we're kind of thinking through the remaining 120 basis points, maybe a little help kind of bridging like SG&A leverage, excluding advertising, inflationary pressure, excluding tariffs? And then maybe thinking through some of the cost savings that you noted.

Paul Rode
CFO, Treasurer & Principal Accounting Officer

So as you've highlighted, we're calling for our EBITDA margins to be down about 280 basis points compared to a year ago. And as you mentioned, about 80 basis points of that is tariff. From a line item perspective, we expect gross margins to be down, that's the lion's share of that decrease. And then SG&A, we would expect to be modestly down with advertising an 80 basis point headwind, and then there's offset partially by some G&A leverage. When you look at within gross margins, we were calling for inclusive of tariffs, a low to mid-single-digit inflation headwind.

Much of that is on whey proteins, which is the input cost on our powders, we are taking pricing for late in Q1. So obviously, that will start to get offset as we move into Q2 and beyond. On our shake business, we do have a little bit of a step-up in Q1 and then inflation is pretty flat to slightly up as we kind of go through the year on shakes. And so the puts and takes are, we have some additional inflation, especially on our powder business, which were pricing.

On our shake business, we have some modest inflation as we go through the year, but we also have cost savings initiatives that are more impactful in the second half of the year. So one of the things I want to point out here is that if you look at our margins, kind of by quarter, the first half obviously has -- we're lapping a very, very strong margin first half last year. We had gross margins nearly 35%.

And so that's -- so as you look at kind of the headwinds throughout the year, first quarter has the biggest headwinds on a margin perspective versus a year ago. Q2 also has a sizable headwind, but less than Q1. And then as we get to the second half, things are actually fairly similar versus a year ago from a margin perspective. So it's really the first half where we have the biggest headwind related to margins. And again, largely driven by inflation, but also our stepped up promotions as well.

Our next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS.

Peter Grom
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So I wanted to go back to the market share discussion and a follow-up to Andrew and Steve's question. And I guess specifically on what you are seeing from the insurgent brands. And I guess -- do you think they have the potential to see similar market shares to what the category leaders are at today? And I ask this more around the debate around what the competitive landscape looks like. I think some point to the potential that we could -- this industry could be similar to what we see in energy drinks, where you have a duopoly versus maybe some others where you have 5, 6 brands with similar shares. So Darcy, I know you mentioned that you think it's -- some of these brands are going to go away, but maybe you can take the other side of it, I'm curious if you think any of these insurgent brands have potential to become more real competitive threat over time?

Darcy Davenport
CEO, President & Director

I mean I'll just -- you guys have been along with our journey, and I think you even see it with our major competitor. It takes a long time to build a national network of a national supply chain. And so I think that from a -- I think it's -- I think you can -- some of these insurgent brands can do well in one retailer. But I think expanding out, and we've done it. This is kind of -- in many ways, this is our playbook, right? Like we started in club, we expanded outside of it. It is incredibly complicated. So it is complicated to -- it's a complicated supply chain, the expertise that you need to have the sophistication around expanding and being able to service multiple different channels simultaneously as well as the back end of -- on the co-man side.

And then even if you're self-manufactured, that's a whole another piece. So I am assuming, we are assuming that, of course, there's going to be -- there are going to be a couple of these insurgent brands that probably make it. But it is going to take a while. And I think that what we're seeing, but I think there will be many more that don't. And that -- and I just do not want to underestimate the move from one kind of club customer to go national is very complicated. It takes multiple years, and it's a different skill set. So yes, I think that ultimately, I think this category is going to consolidate around kind of the most successful brands, a handful of them. And I clearly think that's going that's obviously going to include us as the #1 brand.

Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein.

Alexia Howard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Can I ask about pricing expectations, price versus volumes embedded within your guidance. You're obviously taking a list price increase on Dymatize. With the rest of the portfolio, do you expect promotional activity step-up to actually bring pricing downwards? And does that cadence vary through the year?

Paul Rode
CFO, Treasurer & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. So for -- I'm going to break it into brand. So for Premier Protein, we would expect a modest kind of a low single-digit headwind related to pricing. So that incorporates our stepped-up trade investments, offset by -- we expect some favorable mix. So there is a low single-digit headwind we're expecting on our shake business, which obviously is the biggest part of our business. On Dymatize, we're taking a price increase on powders, but we expect mix to play a big part of this because we now have RTD shakes and Dymatize, and those are at a much lower price per pound than powder. So it throws off a really funky mix. So net overall for total BellRing, I would expect a low single-digit headwind overall with Premier similar and then Dymatize, even though we're taking a price increase, may look like it's negative because of just mix.

Our next question comes from Matt Smith with Stifel.

Matthew Smith
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Darcy, following up on the discussion or Paul, around higher promotional activity over the next year. We've seen a step-up in promotional intensity from insurgence in recent weeks. As you look forward, do you expect Premier promotional activity to be moving higher more on a frequency or a depth basis? And do you expect that to be focused in certain channels? It sounds like maybe club promotion should be similar relative to the prior year once we get past the first quarter?

Darcy Davenport
CEO, President & Director

Yes, I think that's me, right, Paul. Yes. So you're exactly right. We're expecting to see a little bit of a step-up of promotion in '26. And yes, I think, it's interesting that just October, especially in the club channel is usually not a high promotion time period, and it was a little bit more, and it's coming from the insurgent brands. So from our standpoint -- and also, I would just say that just remember that this category is actually fairly low promotion compared to many categories. It's just about -- it's about 25% to 30% sold on deal. So just keep that in mind as you're thinking about just this category kind of in the macro.

But as far as our business, we are going to see a little bit of uptick in promotion mostly as we talked about, our emphasis, specifically in FDM as we are getting out of the aisle, as I've talked to you guys before, the key is for us is getting out of the aisle to get that trial, to get that -- and then with our 50% repeat, we get the repeat. So that's a big emphasis. It's why we brought on the brokers. It's why we have a new internal team focused on this, around singles and entry point priced multipacks. So because of that, when you have that merchandising, you usually have to do some sort of a TPR. So we are going to see a little bit of a step-up of promotion that comes along with that expanded merchandising.

Our next question comes from Yasmine Deswandhy with Bank of America.

Yasmine Deswandhy
BofA Securities, Research Division

So I just had a quick one on longer-term strategy. So you guys walked away from the PowerBar business a couple of years ago. And considering that the convenient nutrition category is expanding outside those traditional products. Have you given any thought into, say, going back into bars or expanding into breakfast offerings like waffles, pancakes and cereal. I guess I'm just asking as well because given the recent -- the press release of the recently announced Board appointment, it highlighted David's finance M&A background. So I also don't know if there's -- has there been any change in your capital allocation priorities, particularly around M&A and your product portfolio as well.

Darcy Davenport
CEO, President & Director

Why don't I hit the portfolio piece and Paul, you can hit capital allocation. So from a portfolio standpoint, we really -- we believe in our category, specifically ready-to-drink shakes and secondarily powders. We think that there is a ton of opportunity. I talked about in my prepared remarks just around this demand landscape study that we did. A key part of that demand landscape study was to evaluate and make sure that there was going to be a ton of room to grow, and there were many years of strong growth kind of a ton of white space that we could capture.

So it confirmed that. So we love this category. We think there's a lot of opportunity. We have a great brand to compete. Now having said that, we also do participate in some of these -- we have a great brand that we have learned that can travel to heavier traffic aisles. We are competing in some of these other areas, but we're doing it through licensing. So if you -- we actually have a frozen pancake, we have a frozen waffle. We have a dry pancake mix.

We have a cereal, and we're actually expanding some of those, but we do it through licensing because we want -- I want this organization laser-focused in what we believe is the biggest opportunity, which is ready-to-drink shakes and powders. So no, we do not have any plans to go back into bars. It's a highly competitive area, low barriers to entry, et cetera. So -- but we love the area that we in and we think there's a lot of upside, and I'll pass it over to Paul for capital allocation.

Paul Rode
CFO, Treasurer & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes, thanks, Darcy. Yes, on capital allocation, I would say that our priorities haven't shifted really that much. Obviously, our first priority is always investing in the business. And as we talked about, we are making investments this year within trade and promotions continue to drive this business. Outside of that, because we generate really strong cash flow, we're not expecting to change our asset-light model. We have low CapEx. Obviously, that provides us a lot of cash flow that we can obviously allocate from recently, and we still think is the most attractive is share repurchases. We've obviously leaned into share repurchases.

And so that's still our near-term priority, but M&A, we're always looking at M&A. We're looking all the time. We get pitch things all the time. And so we'll definitely keep an eye out on M&A, and that's something I think that is becoming -- I wouldn't call it near term, but it's more kind of in the mid- to longer-term priorities for us. And yes, David, coming to the Board obviously brings a lot of strength in that area. So that's great for us. And so yes -- but yes, M&A is something we're always looking at. And if we find the right opportunity, we certainly would go after it.

Darcy Davenport
CEO, President & Director

Yes. And on the Board side, we're really happy to have David on board. I think he brings a great skill set, and we're always looking at expanding and improving the skill set on our board. Our Board has been incredible over the years, and we just want to continue to make it better and increase the skill set. And I think David does that.

Next question comes from John Baumgartner with Mizuho Securities.

John Baumgartner
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

I'd like to ask about RTD category segmentation. Fairlife Core Power, they've established that Premium segment in ultrafiltered milk, but now we've seen two legacy competitors relaunched with ultrafiltered, some of the newer entrants, the insurgents private label, they're adopting ultrafiltered. So I'm curious, Darcy, why the category is making this shift with ultrafiltered becoming more of a standard recipe? Is it tied to raw materials availability? Is it due to the license to move more Premium? Is there a specific consumer you sense they're chasing? Just curious your thoughts there on that recipe shift? And how might this shift position Premier differently relative to history?

Darcy Davenport
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Yes, I think the category is maturing. I think that it is -- when we did our demand landscape study, I think that what became very clear and our head of innovation, I will quote her, and she described the landscape is like there's different strokes for different folks. Meaning some -- when the category is more nascent, kind of everybody kind of wanted the same thing. But as it expands, there are different preferences. And so for instance, some people want thickshakes. Some people want thinner shakes. Some people want dairy shakes, some people want plant. So I think what's the good news for us is that our core 30-gram shake addresses the biggest consumer needs, but it doesn't address every consumer need.

And so as we now are kind of growing up, we hit with the 30-gram with our core offering, we hit the biggest one, but now we're launching innovation to go after some of these other needs. And like -- I mean, I think a good example of that is, so when you're talking about ultra-filtered milk, that is an innovation. It's a thinner offering. It's more of a beverage. Ours is more of a thicker shake. Ours is more of a meal replacement. So I think that starts explaining why there's actually not that much interaction between the two. It's going after kind of a different consumer, different occasion.

We launched almond milkshake, that's a non-dairy. We knew that was an opportunity. We think it's a smaller opportunity than the dairy side of things, but it's an incremental opportunity. And I think our numbers that we're getting from almond milkshake, even though it is early, are showing exactly that, 50% incremental, we're getting to new people. So that is a key aspect of our innovation strategy is really going after -- make sure that our 30-gram core business is strong. We always are looking at making it better. We're always looking at bringing in news and flavor innovation, et cetera. But at the same time, we also are going after some of these other incremental consumer needs with other innovation.

Our next question comes from Jon Andersen with William Blair.

Jon Andersen
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

We talked a lot about the insurgent brands this morning. And Darcy, you mentioned you expect over time there to be a bit of a shakeout, which makes sense to me with some winners and some not meeting the thresholds. But in your kind of experience, how long would you expect kind of a process like that to kind of take or to play out. And the reason I ask is because it seems like the competitive dynamic that is weighing a bit today, it could remain difficult until that kind of shakeout period -- shakeout event kind of plays out more broadly in the market.

Darcy Davenport
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I mean it's a great question. I think that we're seeing it right now, obviously, we're seeing brands that are not making the thresholds. I think what -- I think I would zoom out a little bit. So I think the reason why even in Steve's very first question, just about our view of the category these insurgent and kind of crossover brands, they're getting a lot of attention. They only represent 10% of the category, and there are a lot of them. So -- and I think that remembering, and I think that what is important is where the growth is coming from, it's coming from the leading brands, bringing in more households and then also sourcing volume from those declining legacy brands, which are not insignificant.

30% of the market share is in these kind of declining legacy brands. So what's happening is that, yes, there's going to be some churn in the insurgent kind of crossover brands. Some are going to make it, some of them not. There's always going to be new news. It's an exciting category. I mean you see it in energy. There's always like this group that kind of starts turning. But like if you zoom out the leading brands, which have established, which has -- they have high -- let's just talk about Premier, #1 household penetration, #1 repeat, national supply chain that we've built over years and years and years. We have -- we're now invested, we have capacity. We're now investing in the brand, we're leaning in, we're partnering with retailers to figure out where in the store that this category should be, and how it should be merchandised, and how to maximize it. They're choosing us to do that.

So the leading brands are just going to -- they're going to keep on winning. There's going to be churn around the insurgent brands. And then the legacy brands are going to be the ones, I think, that continue to be -- they have been shared donors for years, and they're going to -- and that is just -- it's kind of accelerating. So your question around how long is it going to take? I mean, I think there's going to always be this kind of churn of insurgent brands. And I think it's an exciting category. We watch it for sure. But I think that there will -- I think the focus in my mind is -- and they're actually sourcing some volume from the declining legacy brands. So -- but I think the focus is that we definitely expect there to be a consolidation and the most successful brands are the ones that are going to really propel forward.

Darcy Davenport

Yes, it was always going to be -- it was always going to be a temporary SKU. So it went in -- it's coming out in Q2. So it will phase out.
