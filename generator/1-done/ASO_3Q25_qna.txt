Question-and-Answer Session


Operator

[Operator Instructions] At the end of the Q&A session, CEO, Steve Lawrence, will make closing comments.

Our first question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi.


Paul Lejuez
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Curious, if we could start with the average, the ticket increase of 3.3%. If you could talk about AUR versus UPT, the buildup to get to that ticket. And then I'm curious what sort of price increases were taken in the third quarter? And relative to the costs that were running through the P&L, I know you brought in some inventory early. So I'm wondering if there was like a temporary mismatch between the prices that you took benefiting the gross margin versus how those tariff costs run through the P&L? And what is the dynamic for 4Q and even beyond as we look out to first half of '26?


Steven Lawrence
CEO & Director

Thanks for the question, Paul. Carl and I will probably tag team this. From an AUR perspective, played out as we thought. AURs for the quarter were up mid- to high single digits as we progress through the quarter, which is what we had outlined on our last call. UPT was down mid-single digits. So we did see some trade-off between AUR and unit sales as we progress through the quarter in terms of pricing.

We've talked about -- there's a lot of different ways. We've been trying to raise AURs. A lot of that is through clearance management, promotion management. And of course, the last resort was taking up tickets. We did a little bit of that in the quarter, which resulted in the higher margin. We do feel pretty good about where we sit from a pricing architecture perspective at this point in time, heading into holiday. So it played out about as we thought.

In terms of the flow-through from a tariff perspective, I'll turn it over to Carl.


Earl Ford
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So within that 170 basis points of gross margin, 120 basis points was growth related to merchandise margin. That's inclusive of the tariff burden, and then we had 30 basis points of freight, good news in 20 of shrink. As it relates to the 120 basis points of merchandise margin growth, you're right, we're on weighted average cost. So to the extent that we're moving AURs up in anticipation of tickets positioning, you'll get a little bit of a bump associated with that in the initial quarter. We're beginning to see that as it relates to the fourth quarter, which was kind of a -- the last part of years, we've got the midpoint of our guidance at flat gross margin. And I think that's appropriate for the environment that we're in.


Paul Lejuez
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

And just a follow-up. What sort of price increases should we expect to see in the fourth quarter relative to the third? And will that be the peak of the price increases? Or does it get even higher as we look out to the first half?


Steven Lawrence
CEO & Director

Yes. Our expectation from an AUR perspective is up high single to low double digits for Q4. We'd expect that to kind of plateau at that level and carry into Q1 and Q2 of next year. And as we lap kind of the accelerated tariffs in the back half of the year, settle in at more of a flattish level. But certainly, what we're going to see for Q4, we think will carry forward into Q1 and Q2.

Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.


Pedro Gil Garcia Alejo
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

This is Pedro on for Simeon. Nice job with the continued rollout of the Jordan brand. Could you give us some color on what the contribution looks like that you're seeing at the store level in terms of sales, margin, what the continued rollout looks like in the next year?

And as a follow-up, you've talked in the past about other brand partners like Levi, Adidas, Under Armour, you've mentioned. Can you give us an idea of the pipeline in terms of new or expanded collaborations with brand partners?


Steven Lawrence
CEO & Director

So I'll start with -- yes, we continue to be really pleased with the contribution of Jordan and increased access to better Nike product has -- had on our stores as we cited in the prepared remarks. If you combine those 2 brands, we don't have last year for Jordan, right? But if you combine the 2 brands, they were up high single-digit comps. So that's pretty exciting, considering Nike is our biggest brand already. So that's a meaningful contribution. We've rolled out elements to all stores, as we noted in the prepared remarks, things like cleats, slides, some sporting goods like basketball and things like that. We're going to roll more apparel and footwear out in more stores in spring. So we expect it to be a growth driver for us into next year as well.

In terms of new brands, listen, it's not just about apparel and footwear. We're really focused on making sure we have a lot of new exciting things across the whole footprint. So some of the things we called out, when you look at what we've done with brands like Burlebo, we've rolled out other brands more deeply into the store, such as Birkenstock in footwear. We've got some new hot trading cards that have come in. We've got a lot of new fun innovative brands that we brought in this year. We'll continue to do that. It's not just about apparel and footwear. It's looking for those things across the store. And I think we're looking at not just tried and true brick-and-mortar brands, but things that are digitally native and looking for ways to partner with them and bring them into retail as well.

Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.


Jolie Wasserman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

This is Jolie on for Chris. Just following up on that Nike expansion, Jordan launch question. Since Academy is still negative, would it be fair to assume that the lift from that combined brand is less than you originally expected, considering I believe last quarter was meaningful double-digit, this quarter more high single digit? Or is it more so that the consumer is just worse given broader macro trends and uncertainty?


Steven Lawrence
CEO & Director

Yes. I would say it's meeting our expectations and doing better in some categories. So we're very, very pleased with how this is playing out for us. If you go back and look at the quarter, actually, we -- if you take ammo out, we would have run a positive comp. I have a boss who whenever I said things like that in the past, and I'd say, hey, if you take ammo, we run a positive comp. I say, well, yes, you could take the Eagles out of the Super Bowl last year, the Chief [indiscernible] 1, 5 Super Bowls. So we try not to do that too often. But generally, we're pretty pleased with the performance of all the different categories. All categories ran an increase last quarter.

Ammo was probably the one drag, and that's really, we believe, a reflection of anniversarying the runup of the election last year, we saw a big surge in demand. And as we noted in the prepared comments, once we got past that in November, we saw the ammo business stabilize. So I feel like the initiatives are playing out as we thought, we're seeing acceleration in our dot-com business, acceleration in our new store business. It really was ammo was the drag.


Jolie Wasserman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

That makes sense. And our follow-up question is on the implied 4Q comp guide. Our math, we're getting that a down 3.5 to an up 3.5, which is a wide range for the fourth quarter. So we were curious why the range is so wide and what the puts and takes are of hitting the high and low end?


Earl Ford
Executive VP & CFO

It is a wide range. We're not national. We've got some localized stuff that's going on from a weather perspective. The midpoint of the guidance is flat, and Jolie, your ranges are about right.

From a puts and takes standpoint, look, AURs are elevated, like that's a load on the consumer, the price of poker has gone up with tariffs. And so what we're seeing is that the AUR is largely offset with unitary degradation, whether in the form of traffic or UPTs. And so the downside implies that elasticity worsens, and the upside is basically just how the consumer responds to that. So that's really the difference between the high and the low is the unitary offset of AURs going up.

Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.


Emily Kech
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

This is Emily Ghosh on for Kate. We were wondering, how would you characterize the health of the Academy customer? And how does the level of trade in that you saw again from upper income customers compares to what you saw in the second quarter?


Steven Lawrence
CEO & Director

Yes. So I think that's an interesting question. I think there's a lot of talk out there amongst different bets around this K-shaped economy. I believe that that's a real thing. I think that at the high end, we're seeing continued growth with consumers making over $100,000 a year annually. We saw that growth continue into this quarter being in the high single digits. As we noted in the prepared remarks, that's a little lower than we saw in Q2 and Q1, where it was up in the double-digit range. But that being said, we're starting to lap that trend that we started to see happen a year ago. So we're pleased that we're continuing to see it build on top of double-digit growth from last year.

The middle-income consumer continues to be fairly steady and shopping pretty regularly. And then the lower income consumer continues to pull back and be very thoughtful about where they're shopping. And so we've seen declines there in the mid-single digits. That being said, that trend also got better versus where it was in Q2 and Q1. So we're adding more customers in at the top end faster than we're trending at the low end. That being said, we like all the shoppers to come shop with us this holiday, and we've got great deals and great values to try to attract them. But certainly, the lower-end consumer continues to be under pressure with inflation and what's going on in the economy.


Earl Ford
Executive VP & CFO

We talked a little bit, Emily, about this on the last call. But if I think about the last year at Academy, I think there's been an exceptional derisking of the consumer portfolio. And by that, I mean, look, we don't want people who make below 50,000 quintiles 1 and 2 to stop shopping with us. But I think not just in Academy, but overall prices in the marketplace have gone up. And in some cases, they've just -- they're not shopping in the category anymore. If you think about that being more than offset with households that make over $100,000, if I compare the average customer now versus a year ago, they're significantly healthier, but I think it's because of the trade into Academy in those quintiles 4.


Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.


Unknown Analyst

It's Adam on for Ike. Two questions. One, on the really strong e-commerce results. Help us understand if that was in line with your thinking, if it's better than what you're thinking. And if that's the case, maybe how that could impact sort of your thinking on new stores in those new markets going forward, right? Is it more maybe of fill in and then use e-com to drive that area and maybe make it more profitable earlier than expected?

And then secondly, also on stores, just with the pivot back to existing markets next year more so than this year. Help us understand maybe like the cost of a store in a new market versus an existing market.


Steven Lawrence
CEO & Director

Yes. This is Steve. We'll probably tag team this one. I would say the dot-com business being up 22% was above where we had planned it. I think the team has done a really, really good job there. I'd love to point to one thing that's driving it. I think it's a combination of all the efforts the team has made over the past year in terms of improving navigation and filtering the product, improved site functionality and search, more personalized experiences, expanded assortment options through drop ship. It's all that work that's really helped. And as we said, there's definitely a symbiotic relationship between adding a new store into a new market and then us seeing a surge in dot-com demand as we build brand awareness in that new market. So we expect that to continue as we move into new markets.

Pivoting to kind of the mix between existing and new markets. We're going to move back next year to about 80-20 new and existing. So if you look at it, legacy and existing, I'm sorry to be about 80% new will be 20%. What we found as we've been going on this journey is that while we've been opening up and primarily focused on new markets, there's been a lot of population growth in our core legacy markets. As a matter of fact, there was a stat we're looking at the other day that I think over 1/3 of all commercial real estate being developed in the U.S. is in Texas right now. And so we've got a lot more opportunity than maybe we initially thought to open up stores in kind of our legacy footprint. We tend to find those stores more in those midsized markets where our Always Game family lives, and they're a little underserved in terms of other retail outlets. And so we think that's a really big opportunity for us. In terms of the economics of the new stores opening up in a new market versus an existing market?


Earl Ford
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think from a build-out standpoint, we're still at the $4 million to $5 million, and that's all in. That's inclusive of net inventory. As I think about the run costs, from a brand awareness standpoint, the brand awareness within our legacy or existing footprint around Academy is exceptionally high. And so I think from a marketing standpoint, we're not going to have to introduce the brand as much as I think about some of the new states that we've opened over the last 2 or 3 years.

I think from a rent perspective, rents are going up in the U.S. as we look at some of these small to midsized marketplaces, really attractive rents and landlords and municipalities that really want us there. So I think the overall ROIC proposition and payback period would be better as it relates to legacy in existing marketplaces. But with that being said, we're not going to stop planting seeds and growing the brand. We're just seeing some really compelling opportunities within our space.

And I do want to just speak directly to cannibalization. We're seeing very low levels of cannibalization when we look at our pro formas, how these stores will operate. We look at drive times to existing stores, if it's an hour away. There's going to be some level of overlap, we model that in the net ROIC, and we're actually pretty pleased. I think some of that is because of the population demographics that Steve spoke to.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.


Unknown Analyst

This is [Dan Silverstein] on for Michael. Maybe just to start, with merchandise margins up 120 basis points in 3Q, inventory units sound like they're in a healthy position, what are the potential pressure points for the fourth quarter gross margin outlook?


Steven Lawrence
CEO & Director

I think it comes down to just the health of the consumer, right? I think the word everybody is using is choiceful. And so what we've seen is that, that is really demonstrated by the customer coming out when promotions are happening and pulling back when they're not aggregating sales around promotions. And that's really what's going to drive it, right? At the end of the day, it's going to be -- we've got a lot of thoughtful promotions we've built out there that hopefully will resonate with the consumer. But I think the biggest probably wildcard will be how they react to those promotions and what's the take rate on those as we progress throughout the holiday. I think we're in a pretty good place from a seasonal perspective. We really don't think there's going to be a big seasonal liability carryover from that perspective. But I think it's more just the customers' appetite to buy and how much they buy on promotion.


Unknown Analyst

Very helpful. And then just a follow-up. As your recent vintages of store openings have continued to get more productive, does this help provide a floor for what you think is achievable from a comp perspective next year? I think you cited a high single-digit comp for those recent store openings a very healthy level. So just wondering how that evolves from here.


Earl Ford
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I'm very fired up about how the new stores are performing. I think we have a high degree of precision of how year 1 will come out based off of whether there's market awareness. And that $12 million to $16 million is playing out kind of like we thought. As it relates to high single-digit comp once they're in the base. And again, we treat things that once they -- on the 14th month, they fall into the comp set. Something that I think is really meaningful, there's 26 stores in the third quarter that are in that comp set, and it provided about a 50 basis point comp tailwind if you think about it from a waterfall standpoint. We'll have 50 stores this time this year that are in that comp base. So I think the things that you guys have seen in the marketplace and we've seen in the marketplace as it relates to building up that retail pipeline, it's going to play out that way here. And I think we'll like the way that, that matures long term.

Our next question comes from the line of Robby [indiscernible] with Bank of America.


Madeline Cech
BofA Securities, Research Division

This is [ Maddie ] Cech on for Robby. I just wanted to ask how Black Friday promos compared to last year? And what's the risk that you need to be more promotional later in the quarter based on what happens in retail overall? And given Foot Locker stands to be more aggressive with clearance this holiday in footwear.


Steven Lawrence
CEO & Director

Yes. I would say promos were roughly in line with where they were last year for Black Friday. things we've looked at as we've been trying to look at raising AURs is how do we promote, how broad is that promotion, how long do we run it. But if you look at the absolute level of promos for us, and it looks like across the industry, I would say it's fairly consistent with last year. I think as we go through the holiday, I think the wildcard continues to be, as I said earlier, just what is the customers' take rate on those promos. What we've seen happen a lot in Q3 and in Q4 is if we run the same promotion as we did a year ago, same level, et cetera, more customers are taking advantage of that. So I think that's going to be a thing that we're going to see continue as we make our way through the rest of the holiday.

In terms of Foot Locker promotions, I would tell you our assortment versus theirs, there's not much overlap. They certainly -- they carry Jordan, a lot of basketball shoes. We tend to be more game shoes. They tend to be more limited edition releases and things like that. So we don't expect that to have a big impact on us. Certainly, that's more mall-based customer. Most of our stores are off-mall. So I don't think it's going to have a lot of impact on us.


Madeline Cech
BofA Securities, Research Division

Appreciate it. And can you talk about where you're raising price within your assortment versus where you might have seen some unit degradation?


Steven Lawrence
CEO & Director

I'd say, in general, prices have gone up a little bit almost across the board. Certainly, it's more pronounced in the hard goods side of the business and the apparel side of the business based off that sourcing base is. But once again, as we're looking at raising AURs, there are multiple tactics we're looking at, right? Step one is being better in how we manage clearance. And so taking less goods to clearance and being more thoughtful about when and how we clear goods. We're looking at promotions in a lot of cases, maybe shortening the length of promotions or maybe not being as broad, including everything within the brand, maybe it's just the key categories.

In some cases, it may be reducing the depth of promotions. And so we look at all those things first. And then the last thing we try to look at would be actually physically raising prices, the tickets on goods. Certainly, some of that's happened as the national brands have passed on price increases and raised their MSPs. We tried to keep in lockstep with that with our private brands. But I would say it's pretty broad-based. It's not any one area, but it's more pronounced in the hard goods side of the business.

Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.


John Heinbockel
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

I want to start with year 2 and year 3 comps on the new stores, how much do they tick down from high single digit, if at all? I don't know if they kind of land mid-single digit. And is -- if I think about the traffic ticket composition of that, how does that look, right, in those new stores? And then clearly, World Cup will be a positive next year. How significant do you think that is? And obviously, that's something you can lean into, I would imagine, pretty hard.


Steven Lawrence
CEO & Director

I think we'll tag team this one. I'll take the World Cup piece of it first. Listen, I think it's going to be significant, right? We have a lot of games and matches that are going to be played within our footprint between Dallas and Houston. We already have some World Cup jerseys on the floor as well as the soccer ball, the [indiscernible] soccer ball at various levels and the initial reads on both are very, very good. I think we're excited about. We're not going to give guidance next year, but certainly, we think it could be a tailwind for us through the summer months as the World Cup plays out. But really, what we think is that the impact will be more long lasting than that. The last time the World Cup was in the United States, real benefit was not the actual bump you got from tourism or selling jerseys. It was the participation in soccer after the fact. And we really think that's going to provide a big tailwind for the soccer business for us for many years to come, not only in '26, but '27 and '28.


Earl Ford
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And John, as it relates to the kind of the year 2 comp, the only thing that I would call out as being a bit different is that 14th month tends to be a negative comp. So there's still some grand opening anniversarying and some marketing hoopla and the neatness of having a new store in my location drives a lot of activity. The positive comp in the first quarter, but that first month is a little bit different. And then as it relates to year 2 and year 3, we're seeing pretty good strength across the board associated with that. I think the only thing to call out there was we literally be that 14th month just tends to be negative.


John Heinbockel
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

And my follow-up, when you look at population, population growth in a lot of your markets, Florida looks incredibly underdeveloped. What's your thought when you kind of do your long-term real estate plan on that state? And is there -- is real estate availability cost, is there anything holding that back or just -- that's kind of how the availability has fallen?


Earl Ford
Executive VP & CFO

I love the Florida marketplace. I think it plays out exceptionally well associated with our fishing assortment. I think the demographics of the state line up pretty well with getting outside and having fun. The one thing I would call out is the state is proud of the land and they're proud of the rents that they charge in some of these locations. We're committed to having a ROIC of 20% and a 4-year payback. So I think we're very selective associated with where we go in, and we'd love to partner with landlords who want to make that worth our while. But I love the demographics. I love the people that are moving to the state of Florida. I just -- we got to make sure it's a win-win opportunity, and we don't degradate the ROIC of the company associated with where we put stores.


Steven Lawrence
CEO & Director

Just to be clear, when we're talking about 80% of the new stores next year kind of in legacy and existing markets. Florida would be an existing market for us. And we think that there's a lot of opportunity, particularly in these middle-sized markets with underserved consumers there. We think that definitely aligns with who our customer is, and you're going to continue to see us grow in Florida.

Our next question comes from the line of Anna Glaessgen with B. Riley.


Anna Glaessgen
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

I'd like to turn back to the ammunition commentary. I believe that ammo and firearm together are less than 10% of sales. So surprised by the magnitude of impact that, I guess, ammo had on the quarter. So maybe if you could expand on that, maybe there's a seasonal aspect because 3Q captures the hunt season. And then secondly, as we've seen some stabilization in ammo post election, is it possible at this new stable level, but still negative, you can drive a positive comp?


Steven Lawrence
CEO & Director

Yes, absolutely. So you're right, we've cited in the past that ammo and firearms combined about 10% of the business. So you can assume ammo is roughly 5%. It does at certain time periods have outsized impact. What we attribute the sluggishness or slowness we saw in the ammo sales in Q3 was really a reflection on the election run-up from a year ago. If you go back -- and this is something we see traditionally in front of a lot of different presidential elections. There's a run-up in advance of that as people are trying to better figure out what's happening one way or the other in terms of who's going to get elected. And we saw that right at the tail end of October last year. And so as we came up against that, it certainly put us in a place where we're having a hard time comping those comps.

We did see it stabilize as we got past that time period, which leads us to believe it was really the election run-up that was driving that. Yes, we do believe that ammo, if it can run even where it is today in the mid-single -- actually it's high single digits negative right now. We should be able to post comps if we can keep it at that level. It's only when it starts running much more negative that, that becomes a bigger [indiscernible]..


Earl Ford
Executive VP & CFO

And I want to be real specific. Ammo, in the third quarter, was a negative 130 basis point headwind to comp. So if you bump that up against our negative 90 basis points, we would have been plus 40 without it, and for all the reasons that Steve just said.


Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Civello with Truist.


Joseph Civello
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

First off, how should we be thinking about the potential growth contribution from Nike and Jordan in '26 versus 2025? I know you'd be lapping a tougher brand-specific comp, but offsetting that, you'll have a broader assortment for the full year, incremental doors and the World Cup.


Steven Lawrence
CEO & Director

Yes. So I would tell you that I think depending upon the quarter, we've seen the combined Nike, Jordan grow in the high single to low double digits. I think you should expect that and we expect that to happen again next year based off a further rollout of Jordan into more doors and continued access and rollout of more fashion product within Nike. It's going to be a growth driver for us, similar to what we saw this year.


Joseph Civello
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then also, can you just give any color on the margin benefits you're seeing from the inventory pulled forward prior to tariffs?


Steven Lawrence
CEO & Director

Yes. I mean I wouldn't say we've seen a huge margin benefit from it. What I would tell you is that it's allowed us to hold pricing on a lot of categories going through holiday. The goal was when we first learned these accelerated tariffs is we were looking at it saying, okay, there's a lot of inventory on this side of the water at those pre-accelerated tariff prices. If we can pull those into our warehouses and DCs, that should allow us to be priced at last year's level on a lot of these items going into holiday, and we think that would give us an advantage, and that's how we planned it and played it out. So we really didn't see it as a huge margin uptick. We saw it more as a way to protect sales and to offer value to the consumer going through the holiday.


Earl Ford
Executive VP & CFO

I just -- I do want to echo it was sweaty knuckles in the first part of the year with that inventory pull forward. I think our units per store were up 6.5% in the first quarter, like 4.5% in the second quarter. Now they're down 0.3%. We have no regrets associated with that pull forward as we do our pricing scraps to look at how like-to-like product or private similar private brand products are selling. we feel really good about our ability to hold that inventory to lower cost and offer that to our consumers, and that's resonating from a value perspective.

Our next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays.


Angus Kelleher-Ferguson
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

This is Angus Kelleher on for Adrienne Yih. I wanted to ask about the percent of product price increases implemented in fall 2025 and expected price increases for spring 2026? And then just curious, since you cited AUR running mid-high single digits and transactions down 4%, where are you seeing the elasticity thresholds by category?


Steven Lawrence
CEO & Director

So if I understand your question correctly, you're asking around prices and AUR increases. As we said earlier, our AUR increases in Q2 were up mid-single digits. We expected Q3 to be up mid- to high single digits. That's exactly what we saw. That's a combination of some price increases as well as promotional rationalization and better clearance management. We expect those to be up -- AURs to be up high single, low double digits in Q4 and hold through Q1 and Q2 of next year. I don't see that necessarily changing. The question we got around elasticity was what we're seeing from a UPT perspective. We saw UPTs be down about mid-single digits. We saw AURs in the quarter up mid- to high single digits.

So it's almost a one-to-one offset. It really varies by category. We've got some categories in front end where I would say that it's been fairly inelastic. We've taken prices up, and there's been no resistance to that. I think if a customer standing in line wants a bottled water, they're going to buy a bottled water, it costs $0.10 more. On the flip side, we've seen other categories that are highly elastic based off the price increases. So it's not a one size fits all. It really varies by category.


Earl Ford
Executive VP & CFO

And I guess, one thing I would add to that is changing prices is very disruptive on the store floor and it's very disruptive in a distribution center. And so how we thought about it is we want to go ahead and make those price changes and not have that be a perpetual activity. Nobody knows what tariffs is going to -- what's going to come out, but we've made those price changes, and they're costly to do on the floor. So our goal in all of the actions we've talked about with growing AUR, the last of which is changing for tickets. We feel that if there's no significant changes to the tariff structure, we've set -- reset the floor, reset the inventory in the distribution center so we can run a little bit more efficiently next year.

Our next question comes from the line of Justin Kleber with Baird.


Zachary Beeck
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

This is [ Zach Beeck ] on for Justin. A couple on modeling. Q4 guidance seems to imply SG&A dollars are below Q3, which is unlike the normal sequential trend in your SG&A. So what is driving the lower SG&A figure in Q4? And how sustainable is this dynamic as you think about the shape of dollar growth next year?

And then Carl, you mentioned resuming buybacks in Q4. Guidance implies a good free cash flow quarter. Can you maybe just size how this buyback plan compares to what you did in Q1?


Earl Ford
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. From an SG&A standpoint, at the midpoint, it's basically 100 basis points of leverage. I don't have an SG&A going down, but it's close. I think some of the things that we're focused on is we've been -- you were kind of comparing it not to last year, but to the third quarter. There's price changes that are going on. I will tell you, last year in the fourth quarter, we had a sale leaseback of a property. We always have first right of refusals on our leases. And in some cases, our landlords are looking to not be landlords and sell to another landlord. So in some cases, we'll step into that. That's a component of it. But I would just say, overall, the team is set up to run efficiently. We've gotten rid of taking a bunch of price changes. We're not trying to do those in November and December. So there's some good news there.

From a buyback perspective, while my words said that we were going to get back at it, I do want to highlight that the guidance that we put out there does not have buybacks embedded in it as it relates to capital allocation philosophy. First, it's stability, hold cash, have the ABL. Second is invest in ourselves. And I would include inventory management in that category. And then third is give the rest back to shareholders with a nominal dividend and buybacks. I think from an order of magnitude standpoint, I'm not going to get into the specifics since it's not included in the guidance, but we think our stock is attractively priced and we do cash flow well.

Our next question comes from the line of Eric Cohen with Gordon Haskett.


Eric Cohen
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

I want to ask about the income cohorts because earlier in previous calls, you had said that it was a sort of 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 breakdown of the high, middle, low income. And today, you said the high income is now 40%. So what do you think you can do to keep that higher income consumer since it seems to have a comp benefit? And do you think this is just a natural structural change in the customer base? Or is this more of just higher income consumers are trading down and the lower income consumer is just under pressure?


Steven Lawrence
CEO & Director

Yes. I think it's a combination of both, Eric. I think that if you look at it, the reason we cited that 40% because that's a pretty meaningful change for us from the 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, and we've seen that happen over the past 4 quarters. So I wanted to call that out. I think what's driving that is 2 things. Number one, I do think that the higher income consumer is looking for value. And I think in some cases, we are the value leader in the space, and they're finding us and discovering us. And I think it's second, the work we've done around the assortment. If you think about where we are today versus where we were even 4 or 5 years ago in terms of layering on better, best brands across the category, that could be baseball bats north of $100 or running shoes north of $100.

I think we're in a different place today. So I think that the work the merchants have done around building out that better, best assortment, adding brands like Jordan or Burlebo or Turtle Box or Ray-Ban Meadows, all those things, I think, give that customer a reason to come shop with us and permission to continue to shop with us. And we're not going to stop assorting those brands, right? We're going to continue to look to build those. That doesn't mean we've lost focus on the value end of our assortment either, but we see this as additive. And so I think as we continue to do this work, bringing in new innovative brands, I think we'll keep that customer shopping with us and continue to grow share there.


Eric Cohen
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Great. And you called out for 20, 25 stores next year. I thought the messaging earlier was that store growth should be accelerating sequentially each year. So is this any change in sort of how you're thinking about store growth going forward? Or is this 2025 sort of the right run rate in '26 and beyond?


Steven Lawrence
CEO & Director

Yes. I think what we're focused on each year is coming up with a list of new stores and locations that we feel really confident about. If you remember, we said about midway through the year that we were kind of pausing new stores and we're giving a lot of guidance around what we're doing in Q1 because we wanted to see how the tariffs played out. We feel really good about the 25 -- 20 to 25 stores we've identified for next year. We feel really good about the pipeline we're building. We'll share more information in our next call around 2026 guidance. And then we're looking to do an Analyst Day probably somewhere in early April. We'll share more details around what the long-range plan in terms of store growth looks like.

Our final question comes from the line of Cristina Fernandez with Telsey Advisory Group.


Cristina Fernandez
Telsey Advisory Group LLC

I wanted to ask about the high-income consumer that's coming to Academy. Do you have a sense of were they previously shopped or where those market share gains are coming from?

And then my second question is around private brands. How are those performing? And do you see -- are you seeing consumers trade into or trade down to private brands as pricing has increased for national brands?


Earl Ford
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. On the income cohort standpoint, I can't speak to specific nameplates that they're coming from. A lot of this information is in our CDP. And in that case, I don't see where they're coming from, our customer database platform. But as it relates to Placer, we're big users of Placer AI. I can see shift I would say, generally speaking, they're seeking value. Look, they can't afford their lifestyle. They're seeing value offered at Academy, and they're intrigued by some new brands that we have.


Steven Lawrence
CEO & Director

And I would say that when they come in, our private brands represent probably our best expression of value to our consumer. We're seeing them trade into those brands. I mean we talked about the strength we saw in Magellan during the quarter or really, I think that's a direct result of this customer coming in, maybe shopping for something that they saw at another store and thinking we have a better price on it and then trading into one of our private brands. That's definitely the behavior we're seeing happening right now. Okay.

I'd like to turn the floor back to you for closing comments.


Steven Lawrence
CEO & Director

I was taking it over before you're going to turn it over to me. So we're proud to close out this year by giving back to communities across our footprint. Throughout this holiday season, we hosted more than 40 local giveback events, partnered with local organizations and gifted $120,000 directly to families in need, combining our company's commitment to making a positive impact on our communities. I'd also like to express gratitude to our 22,000-plus associates who work tirelessly to provide our customers with an outstanding experience when they shop at Academy. As I mentioned earlier, while we are now past the Thanksgiving kickoff of the season, we still have the lion's share of holiday business ahead of us. Having been in a lot of stores over the last month, I can honestly tell you that I feel we're in the best position we've been in since I joined the company to take care of our customers' holiday needs.

With a strong inventory position in the most desirable and trend-right gift ideas, our associates are ready to help the customer and our position as the value leader in the space is clearly resonating with consumers. Before I sign off, we're also excited to announce that we'll be hosting an analyst event in New York on April 7 to provide an update on our long-range plan that will be webcast to the public. In addition, Carl and myself, we will be joined by other members of the executive team, so you can hear directly from the people executing all the initiatives you've been hearing about over the past year. Thank you all for joining our call today, and have a very happy holiday season.
