And our first question comes from the line of Ruben Roy with Stifel.

Ruben Roy
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Oleg and Ilan congrats on the continued progress and results. Oleg to start, last quarter, you broke out for us a little bit sort of the mix as your NSE business continues to evolve. So thinking about it in terms of data center, aerospace and defense and telco, if you could give us an update on what the mix looks like? And then as we think about the guidance, if you could kind of dial in a little bit into the moving parts on the growth for the March quarter, that would be great.

Oleg Khaykin
President, CEO & Director

Sure. So I think last quarter, we kind of talked 45% service provider, 40% data center, 15% aerospace and defense. I think with the significant growth in data center, right? And the other -- I think we are now, I'd say, closer the other way around 40% service provider, 45% data center, around 15% aerospace and defense. To be more precise, I think we're going to see service provider to kind of trend a little bit below 40%. The aerospace and defense trend up above 15% and the data center trend go up 45%. And it's not because the service provider is going down. Actually, it's steady and showing slight recovery. It's just fundamentally the percentage allocation and the growth across different segments is vastly different.

So that's kind of the mix. So I think now we are -- I would say we are -- net of it, we're now only about 40%, a little bit under 40% exposed to service provider, traditional telecom service provider. And I'd say 60% is driven by the data center ecosystem and the aerospace and defense. In terms of the guidance on the Q3 that you've seen pretty strong numbers, it's continued very strong growth in the data center ecosystem. that's, again, semis, modules, systems and the NEMs, but also it includes a growing component of our traditional field instruments, and it's actually a meaningful pop in that we are now seeing the what I call next-gen service providers who are doing interconnect of data centers and the data center operators themselves investing into our fiber monitoring and fiber measurement systems to monitor and optimize performance of their data centers.

And I mean, if I looked at a year ago, you might have been single digits data center for our traditional field instruments. I think we are now looking at about 1/3 of our revenue in the field instruments coming out from data centers. So it's been a truly amazing turnaround. And I think the recognition is growing that the fiber networks are generally c***, and they need to be significantly improved. And we are seeing a lot of pressure from the hyperscalers on service providers to improve the performance, but they're also going further and they are putting a lot of what we call monitoring and policing on their networks to ensure that they pay for what they -- they get what they pay for. So it's actually been another very positive development for us on the fiber instruments. That's on the NSE.

Ruben Roy
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. I guess I had a follow-up on that. Obviously, with Corning and Meta sort of expanding their partnership and $6 billion commitment on new fiber. I would imagine that, that's something that would play into your longer-term opportunity set for the field instruments. But I guess if I think about that, and you made a statement, Oleg, on your prepared remarks regarding your expectations for DC growth to continue through '26. I mean, are things like that and like the scale across opportunities that you just mentioned, giving you extended visibility on demand relative to sort of what the order book might have looked like 12 months ago? I mean, are you getting a longer look on backlog and bookings at this point?

Oleg Khaykin
President, CEO & Director

The answer is yes. I think on the truly big ones, I mean, as you've seen with the Corning deal, right, it's another example of what I've been talking about that the hyperscalers are no longer content, just pay you the money and you deliver the services and products. They are vertically integrating all the way back into their supply chain through either partnerships or strategic alliances like what you've seen with Corning and Meta. And we're seeing similar thing happening with us where you have at the very least multi-quarter commitments and multiyear engagements. And so when it comes to data center, I would say, for us, traditionally, we only had like maybe 1, 1.5 quarter visibility. we have a pretty good view at least on the base demand from these type of activities up to 3 quarters ahead.

Ruben Roy
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Got it. If I could sneak one in for Ilan. Just on the restructuring, Ilan. Is that impacting any specific product area or group? Or is this just sort of your annual look at the business? And obviously, there's a lot going on in DC and aerospace and defense that maybe you want to focus more on. Maybe if you could help us out on how to think about that restructuring, that would be great. That's it.

Ilan Daskal
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So Ruben, thanks for the question. Generally, it's across multiple functions just to make sure that we have operate under the much higher efficiency. So it's not targeting specific areas. And I wanted also to highlight that some of these savings, we do plan to reinvest in those higher growth areas that Oleg just discussed. So some of it will be a trade-off.

Oleg Khaykin
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think clearly, if we look at where most of the cost is coming out, it's coming out of the slower or stagnant product segments. So it's really the point here is to free up resources and take some of it as the financial leverage, but others as the ability to invest and grow the -- could move wood behind the arrow on things like data center ecosystem, aerospace and defense, things like that.

Ilan Daskal
Executive VP & CFO

Right. And in addition to some support function optimization.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Koontz with Needham.

Ryan Koontz
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

A lot of activity in defense and aerospace of late. Oleg, I hope you could double-click on what you see as exciting defense programs, aerospace programs that you're involved in with your product lines and how you think about that business going forward?

Oleg Khaykin
President, CEO & Director

Sure. I think the biggest driver is what we call resilient PNT, position and navigation timing. In essence, it's alternative GNSS. So everything that allows you to operate in the absence of GPS signal. And as you can imagine, it's drones, drones and more drones. It's very much targeting all autonomous systems like drones above ground, robotic vehicles, surveillance, heavy industrial machinery, underseas and seaborne drone. So it's pretty much anything that's above ground, underground, underwater, in the air robotic systems. So that's mainly where a lot of these products are going to. On the other hand is also our PNT timing is we are seeing emerging opportunities in data centers because we're seeing more and more -- as you increase the speeds in the data centers, you need accurate timing for synchronization.

And if you think about traditional distributed clock model from one end goes across all the racks, that may be fine when you're 100 gig data center when you're going to 1.6, 3.2 the latency becomes unbearable. So we are looking -- we're seeing demand for timing at multiple entry points into the data center. So you almost deliver precise timing directly to the rack or the individual server banks.

So we see that business as, I would say, gaining longer-term momentum, particularly in the data center. But I would say short-term and near-term opportunities is very strong growth in the drone systems. But also our traditional avionics communication and the spectrum management is also seeing a lot of opportunities.

Ryan Koontz
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Great. And in the optical domain, you talked a lot about strength in data center driving outperformance here. Any evidence you can share with us around the cadence of optical innovation getting to 1.6T broadly within the data center between the data centers, where are you seeing the most demand for your products? And what are maybe some new areas of growth, some green shoots that you're excited about in the optical data center domain?

Oleg Khaykin
President, CEO & Director

Well, I'd say every segment we see growing. I mean, clearly, the semiconductors or memory vendors that they are driven by speed and the version of PCI Express, which is chip-to-chip interconnect, right? So -- and I mean, today, we are moving from 800 to 1.6 from PCIe 5.0 to 6.0 and then 7.0. So there is a very heavy engagement with the semiconductor vendors from big ASICs to optical ICs development. Then -- so that's kind of where you bring in the bleeding edge product for lab. And then the volume really comes in as those things go into production into the -- with the module vendors. Your dozen or so companies in Asia making pluggables and of course, the big leaders in North America for crosspoint switches, optical switches and various modules. And then all the NEMs who are providing equipment into these data centers.

So I would say there's 2 groups. One is the lab, heavily driven, I'd say everything to do with 1.6 and PCI Express 6.0 and in production, heavily with all of our things making anything from testing passive and active components to the final product, but also including testing fiber as we're now seeing emergence of hollow core fiber and multicore fiber. And this is a whole new thing, and that's why part of the reason you see companies like Meta investing directly in the -- making long-term agreements with the fiber providers is to exactly develop these kind of products. And those things require a lot of testing and monitoring and in production and final test. So it's a -- I mean, it's -- I would say, every cylinder in this whole fiber value chain is, I'd say, firing at full speed.

Ryan Koontz
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

And that's broadly stronger in the lab today than field?

Oleg Khaykin
President, CEO & Director

It's -- we call lab and production. But I would say starting last quarter, we are seeing what we normally call field is becoming a -- I mean, the hyperscalers themselves, so it's the actual data center is becoming a huge user of field instrumentation. I mean, for example, when you would go to the traditional fiber service providers, they never really care about putting in monitoring of the fiber. Well, if you go to one of these AI data centers, you see at the edge, they want to monitor every incoming wavelength, right? And with the light up or dark fiber. So they know as they turn on up the bandwidth, they know exactly characterization and bandwidth and latency they're going to get out of each fiber strand. And of course, there is an SLA agreements, service level agreements there they signed with the service providers. So they're monitoring that these things are coming in within a very narrow spec, and they maintain the narrow spec of performance in every fiber.

And that's a big departure from the old-fashioned, well, it works, it's good enough. If it's a little bit lossy or has a higher latency, so what? Well, that's not something that these guys accept. And the beauty of it is they're deploying these things directly. It's using the same fiber tools, which were developed for traditional service providers. They are really finding converts among the hyperscalers. And that usually means when they deploy it, there's a lag maybe by a couple of quarters before the service providers recognize, oh, wait a second, I'm not being measured, so I better measure myself before I get nailed for my performance problem. So we see it as a very positive trend to ensure a very high resilient fiber network interconnecting the data centers.

And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Spinola with UBS.

Andrew Spinola
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Oleg, can you expand on that a little and give us maybe some color on how your data center business breaks down across lab production and field?

Oleg Khaykin
President, CEO & Director

We don't break those things individually because given any quarter, the mix may be a bit up or down because think about it, right, if you're really launching 1.6, let's say, or PCIe 6.0, 7.0, you will see initially big mix in the -- towards the lab instruments. As these chips get rolled out and they go into production, you're going to see a lot more production. So it's kind of a tick tock type of thing. So the mix -- that's why we don't really break these things down within that category. We just call it generally data center ecosystem, which includes semis, modules, systems and field instruments that are used in data centers themselves.

Andrew Spinola
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Makes sense. I'm thinking about how to model that business into like fiscal '27 and beyond. And I wanted to ask you, this might be wrong based on what you just said, but I would think about lab as being maybe more consistent as the customers continue to invest in the next generation fiber monitoring growing as the number of data centers grow, but maybe production being more cyclical and having some bigger swings up and down as the various generations get introduced. Trying to think about how I should think about production, assuming that's a bigger growth driver right now, how to think about how that evolves over a cycle?

Oleg Khaykin
President, CEO & Director

So it's a good question. So lab instruments are driven by a number of customers and number of projects, right? And ultimately, it relates -- best way to look at it is the R&D CapEx at semis, system vendors and module vendors, right? The production is heavily driven by volume that is demanded, right? And you could see the volume of pluggables and the racks and all this -- I mean, that is -- if I look at where you're going to see higher percentage of growth, it's clearly going to be the production. Because it's -- as you increase number of units you build in every generation and let's say, every node, and that's -- you need to basically for every tranche of volume, you need to increase capacity. So it's heavily linked to the, I would say, production run rate, okay? And the -- I would say, field instruments is, I'd say, linked to the number of data centers being built.

Andrew Spinola
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Got it. That's very helpful.

Ilan Daskal
Executive VP & CFO

Probably we think about the longevity of this cycle is probably.

Oleg Khaykin
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And from what I see in terms of the -- pretty much every ounce of capacity that was kind of abandoned by service providers when they cut back about 3 years ago on investment, it's been totally repurposed into the data center, and it's a fraction of what they need and what they -- if you take all their announcements, how much they're going to spend, how much they're going to invest, what you have in terms of production capacity, you're going to see significant growth over the next 2 years, right? And of course, to keep up with it, you need to keep introducing. We now see the new each technology nodes turning over every 2 years. So you no longer, let's say, between 100 gig and 400 gig, you had 6 years, you really now have 2 years between 1.6 and 3.2.

Andrew Spinola
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Got it. Makes sense. And I want to ask one financial question. Just on the NSE op margin guide, I guess it's roughly flat from fiscal Q2 to Q3. Could you give me maybe some of the push and pulls on that, given the revenue is up $20 million?

Oleg Khaykin
President, CEO & Director

Operating margins are up...

Ilan Daskal
Executive VP & CFO

Are you asking gross margin, operating margin or...

Andrew Spinola
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I'm sorry. The guide for the NSE op margin, Ilan, is for essentially flat sequentially from Q2 to Q3.

Ilan Daskal
Executive VP & CFO

Operating margin. Right. So your question, the dynamic of the higher operating margin?

Andrew Spinola
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I guess the guide for the NSE op margin is 15.5%.

Ilan Daskal
Executive VP & CFO

That's right.

Andrew Spinola
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So, revenue is up $20 million. I was just curious if there is some mix or anything...

Ilan Daskal
Executive VP & CFO

So there is some, obviously, mix associated with it. And -- but also in terms of the operating expenses, remember that in the first calendar quarter, all the kind of what we call fringe expenses like social security, et cetera, get reinstated. So you get a higher operating expenses in the first calendar quarter.

Oleg Khaykin
President, CEO & Director

We accrue all the statutory costs.

Ilan Daskal
Executive VP & CFO

Relative to December. So that's a major kind of gap between the last quarter and this quarter. It's call it seasonality.

Oleg Khaykin
President, CEO & Director

Statutory costs.

And our next question comes from the line of Tim Savageaux with Northland Capital Markets.

Timothy Savageaux
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

On the results and especially the guide. And I wanted to kind of focus in on that a bit. I guess, Oleg, you described it as countercyclical that you usually see declines. But I guess I'd like to try and parse out, you got 13 weeks of Spirent at your Q1 run rate -- or sorry, at your December quarter, I'll just say, run rate that gets you to about, I don't know, $55 million, sort of the high end of where you were, where you guided last quarter. Is that a reasonable assumption to try and get to Spirent contribution versus organic growth in fiscal Q3?

Ilan Daskal
Executive VP & CFO

So Tim, I can chime in here. And in terms of the thinking, so first, for last quarter, in the very first few weeks of the quarter, they actually did not have much revenue. The second aspect to call out, and I think we did discuss it in the past several times. When you think about the seasonality for the Spirent business, usually, the first half of the calendar year is the weaker part and the stronger part is the second half of the calendar year. So it's a little bit lower than your thinking for Spirent for the March quarter. But again, that does not change our full year thinking about the revenue for Spirent. So not much has changed in terms of what we see in the dynamics of their forecast and thinking.

Oleg Khaykin
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Generally, they always have first half of the calendar year was lower, second half was stronger. Now last quarter, there were some government orders that got pushed out into this quarter between the shutdown and of course, this onetime grant to the government employees of Christmas holidays. I mean, there basically was fewer days between middle of December and the end of December to get the orders placed. So some of the volume actually pushed out into the March quarter. As a result, we expect March quarter relatively to be stronger for them than it normally would have been, and the December quarter was a bit weaker than it normally would have been.

Timothy Savageaux
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

Right. That's kind of what I'm trying to get to is to the continuation of this organic growth, and it sounds like I'm a little high with my first pass. And I think it was a $200 million run rate you were looking for. And if it's stronger in the first and the second, I'd imagine it's below that $50 million level. And if that's the case, you're looking at mid-single-digit sequential growth organically for Viavi in Q1 in a normally seasonally down quarter and coming off 15% sequential growth in the December quarter. So that's pretty extraordinary. What's driving all that? And am I looking at that right, number one? And what's...

Oleg Khaykin
President, CEO & Director

No, no, you're looking exactly right. So remember, the old -- I'd say, old Viavi before data center, aerospace and defense, we were heavily influenced by service provider dynamics. And the days 1 service providers were over 80% of NSE. Remember, first quarter is they don't release their budgets for the year until the end of February. So as a result, you would have a very weak NSE quarter. By the way, service provider is no different again than it was normally. There's always -- it is seasonally weaker. But the strength in the data center, aerospace defense and also the Spirent business is not only offsetting, it's actually more than offsetting. That's why the net-net, the quarter is going to be up for NSE.

Timothy Savageaux
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. Makes sense. And one final piece of that question, which is the -- again, going back historically, you typically see a nice seasonal uptick, at least on the service provider side in your fiscal Q4, should we assume that's directionally true for the business? Are there any changes as your mix and exposure becomes more aerospace, defense and AI data center driven. What does that do to that normally stronger Q2 -- sorry, fiscal Q4, especially in light of the strength of your March quarter guide?

Oleg Khaykin
President, CEO & Director

That's right. So actually, as much as though maybe the service providers a bit of a headwind this quarter, they're going to be tailwind next quarter. So with the continued strength in data center and aerospace and defense, you're actually going to have a tailwind also on the service provider. Our expectation that the June quarter is going to be stronger than the March quarter.
