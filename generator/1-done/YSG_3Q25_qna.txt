[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Maggie Huang with CICC.

Manqi Huang
China International Capital Corporation Limited, Research Division

This is Maggie Huang from CICC. Firstly, congratulations for beating our revenue guidance. And I have 2 questions. My first question is about our performance during Double 11 festival. Is that in line with our expectation? And have we observed any change in the competition from foreign high-end brands?

And my second question is that how do we expect the profitability of the fourth quarter and the next year? And that's my question.

Jinfeng Huang
Founder, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

Well, I think, first of all, the Double 11 performance for the whole company, generally, it's in line with our expectations. And of course, some of the brands are exceeding our expectations.

So having said that, I think we are very happy to observe some of -- not only the existing hero SKUs are doing well, but some of the newly launched products are gaining a very strong momentum during the Double 11 shopping festival, which will contribute for further growth potentials in coming quarters. Those products we already mentioned in the earnings call.

Going back to your question about the challenges and also competition coming from the foreign high-end brands. We did observe a very big challenge and also competition for the Double 11 shopping festival. And some of the high-end brands are struggling with very big and also deep price cut for their hero products. We did see that with our R&D supporting some of our new product launch. Those products are still gaining a very strong momentum.

Looking forward, I think the competition during the Double 11 shopping festival will load some of the pantries for some of the foreign high-end brands, so which means you hurt their long-term growth.

So having said that, I'm happy to see that our high-end brand, we're still keeping a very strong momentum by balancing the price promotion and also we're focusing on promoting some of the new SKUs.

So going back to the Q4, I think we are on our right track to reach the profitability. And then that's our long-term goal. And then we are seeing the balance of the growth and also the right track for the profitability. Thank you.

Your next question will come from [ Lucia Zhang ] with CITIC Securities.

Unknown Analyst

[ Lin Zhang ] from CITIC Securities. I also have 2 questions. The first one is we can see that the skin care business of the company has achieved rapid growth this year. So from which assets should we make efforts to sustain the growth maybe in the last quarter and next year?

And the second question is about the profitability. So in which assets will the company, we will make efforts to continuously improve their profitability?

Jinfeng Huang
Founder, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

Well, so going back to the fundamental drivers for our skin care business, I think the #1 thing is about the R&D. Beauty market has always driven by further and better product innovation. So we are very happy to see that with our R&D growth engine and then we can launch a very strong pipeline this year and then -- and also for the coming years as well.

The second thing we can think is with our expansion for our skin care portfolio, including the benefit expansion and also product line expansion, we see further linked sales for our product portfolios, which can help us to drive further marketing online.

The third thing is for our skin care brands, I think the overall for the 3 major skin care brands, we still have a pretty far potential to reach their optimized revenue level. So during this process, as we continue to drive the brand awareness and also continuously drive the customer base, we still have the potential to grow our existing skin care brands.

And then last but not least, I think for us, we focus on launching some new products on some of the key channels. And in the future, we will expand into other channels and also drive further better channel mix. So with that, I think that will contribute to the sustainable driver for the our skin care brand.

Going back to your questions about how can we continue to improve the profitability. I think as we said many times before, I think the product mix optimization and the channel mix optimization can help us drive the gross margin and also the further ROI on the marketing expenses.

The second one is as we focus more on the customer CRM and also the product link sales, this will help us to further drive better ROI on the marketing expenses. The third thing is very important. For some of our brands, those brands are reaching to what we call the optimized threshold. In the future, as the brands like the revenue scale grow up, we will see further leverage on the true branding expenses ROI.

So those are the things -- some of the things we think are very important to drive the continuous improvement for the profitability. Thank you.

The next question will come from Jennifer Wan with [indiscernible] Securities.

Unknown Analyst

This Jennifer [ Wan ] from [indiscernible] Securities. So congratulate on company's great performances. And could you please introduce -- just give us some color on the expected expenses of the company in the future?

And maybe could you please share how do you view the increasingly fierce competition in the online channel?

Jinfeng Huang
Founder, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

Well, can you help me to clarify what the mean by expenses?

Unknown Analyst

Like general expenses, operating expenses, et cetera, just general speaking.

Jinfeng Huang
Founder, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

Okay. Well, if you look at our financial statements, I see we see a pretty stable G&A expenses in the past quarters.

So having said that, I think moving forward, as the scale of our total revenue grow, and then we will see some operational leverage on the general and administrative expenses. We will continuously to invest in some of the -- what we think, short-term-wise, you clarify -- categorized as expenses, but we see it more like the investment, including R&D and also for branding dollars to really build up the brand equity. Those are the -- some of the areas that we focus on.

And sorry, what was your second question?

Unknown Analyst

That's how do you view the like ongoing sales competition on the online channel? How do you think our company is going to face such kind of situation?

Jinfeng Huang
Founder, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

I think, as we said before, when we are looking at the beauty market, there are so many players and then one of the reasons that we can continuously and also accelerating our growth, it's mainly driven for some of the investments we have devoted in R&D in the past few years. And also to our continuously commitment on brand building. So we did something right before. That's why we are getting the growth today.

So if we are looking at the competition, as long as we continue to focus on what we have done right, and then we will see more and more robust product lineup and then a better innovation is coming. And we will see the higher brand awareness so that we can get some more operational and also brand building like optimization. And also, we will see some of the operational efficiency improving by our product mix and the channel mix optimization. And we will see some organization growth, by we focus on the cornerstones of our product innovation, customer focus, CRM and et cetera. So as also we focus on doing the right things, we think, in the future, we will achieve the long-term and sustainable growth result. Thank you.
