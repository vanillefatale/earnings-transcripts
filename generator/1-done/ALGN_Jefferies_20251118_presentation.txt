Presentation

Unknown Analyst

I'm an analyst on the U.S. Medical Supplies and Devices team, and this is a session for Align Technology. From the company, we've got Joe Hogan, President and CEO; John Morici, CFO; and we've also got Shirley Stacy here as well. So thank you all for joining us today.

John Morici
CFO & Executive VP of Global Finance

Of course.

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Thanks for having us.

Unknown Analyst

I guess just to start off, Joe, can you just talk about how you think Align is positioned strategically in the clear aligner market? And what are the key areas of focus over the next few years?

Question-and-Answer Session

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I feel good about Align from a strategic standpoint. We've been at this almost 30 years, obviously. There's no company in the world that knows how to move teeth better than us. When you look at our assets, the way they're spread right now, strong plant in China, Poland and Mexico, we have the different poles covered extremely well. The breadth of our technology has gotten better now with IPE and mandibular advancement and some different products. We can do 100% of the cases that are out there today.

There's really no competitor that can really talk about that, too. And we could talk about also the 3D printing and the next stages of 3D printing and also touchless kinds of ClinCheck. We can move cases faster with more predictability. So I think from an overall global standpoint, from a technology standpoint, from a logistics and manufacturing standpoint, I feel really good about our position.

Unknown Analyst

Great. Thanks for saying that up. I guess I did want to start with kind of 3Q results in the U.S. market. You saw some improved year-over-year growth, but some challenges remain. So I guess can you elaborate on those challenges and just talk about are there any efforts that Align can be outside of an improvement in macro backdrop that can reduce those challenges and help us accelerate growth in the U.S.?

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Mike, I'll start and let John jump in. First of all, we felt good about the third quarter overall. Obviously, we beat guidance and following a disappointing second quarter overall. We felt good about Asia and the strong growth in Europe also in Latin America. North America was the one we pinned down. Obviously, that's still a challenge. But you contrast that with our DSO business, it's growing double digits, some over 20% which is a significant part of our volume now with more of a sluggish retail business.

And look, we're not going to wait for the winds to blow again and tell you what are we doing? We're trying to obviously solidify and grow our DSO base work with financing and some other tools that we know that can help retail base, too. We have a good sales force, and we feel we can make some progress in that sense. And John, what would you add?

John Morici
CFO & Executive VP of Global Finance

Yes. When we talked about of our top 10 markets in the third quarter, 9 out of 10 got better on a year-over-year basis compared to the second quarter. So that was good to see, including the U.S. As Joe said, it's not a great economy in many places. But when it doesn't get worse and it doesn't change, we have a better operating environment to be in. And I think the key that we talked about, and it's true is that active conversion or helping drive that active conversion really makes a difference. And it's being able to work with our customer base, whether it's the aggregators like some of the DSOs or even individual doctors to be able to help them drive patients to their practice. They scan every patient. They show a lot of the visualization and then it's usually followed up with sometimes a discount or financing that, that doctor provides.

That's what's driving conversion. That's what you see with the DSOs where they're taking that active approach. And many of our doctors are doing that so that they can operate in a challenging environment and be able to drive conversion. When the consumer gets better and maybe some of the economies get a little bit better, that should give us a tailwind. But even in this environment, that activity is driving results.

Unknown Analyst

Yes. That's helpful. And I did want to drill down there. You've talked about the U.S. retail accounts recently and in the past and moving downstream from a marketing standpoint. And I think you've also mentioned and you can correct me if I'm wrong, DSOs are about 25% of the business.

John Morici
CFO & Executive VP of Global Finance

Overall.

Unknown Analyst

So with retail accounts,accounting for the vast majority. I guess, how do you think about time lines for some of these efforts going downstream to actually bear fruit?

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think we're seeing it now. I mean we talk about marketing going downstream. So we use our brand, which, obviously, it's one of the major assets that we have. But we're moving close to certain ZIP code areas. We advertise aggressively for the doctors that we have in that particular area. And we've been trying that out over the last couple of quarters, and we've had good success in that sense. So we're going to have -- we're getting better at it, and you'll see us do more of it.

John Morici
CFO & Executive VP of Global Finance

And some of it's product related, too. We talk a fair amount about some of the products where if we don't have to offer products with refinements, and that's what DSOs are doing a lot of. They're taking the product said, look, they want a comprehensive product and they don't want to maybe have unlimited refinements. They just want to pay for the product. And then as they need to do refinements, they pay for them going forward. We're perfectly fine with that. That's driving increased utilization with DSOs.

In addition to what Joe said, that activity that they drive and that go-to-market is bearing fruit, but then also giving products to those doctors. That give them a way to purchase. Sometimes you don't need to purchase this extra service, which is what refinements turn into, just purchase the product, that acquisition cost is lower. That's a good way to go against some of the wires and brackets because that upfront price is still higher than wires and brackets, but it's closer. And that gap that some of those doctors who haven't digitized as much might be more of an incentive. And we see that with our DSOs.

Unknown Analyst

And can you remind us where we are in the rollout of some of those products with the lower upfront cost?

John Morici
CFO & Executive VP of Global Finance

So some doctors are already using that we've seen with some of the DSOs that we have and more of that rolling out to more of the retail side. So by early next year, we'll have more of a product assortment. It's still -- it's a continuation of really our strategy. As we put more technology into the products and really have them so that they can move teeth in a faster, more predictable way and really give doctors those tools. This is just a further evolution of that.

And because those products have gotten better, if you give those doctors different choices so that they might want to do a refinement or they might not, but they don't have to pay for it upfront. That is a good evolution of our portfolio and something that we've tested for over a year now with some of the larger accounts. We think we can apply it to some more of the smaller accounts and retail accounts and we think that will drive utilization and we should see some benefit early next year.

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

What John and I worry about sometimes too, we don't want the market to think we're somehow dumbing the product down in that sense. Remember, we sell a comprehensive product, a comprehensive product back in 2015, 2016 when I started, and we did the 5-year additional Aligner kind of a play. We had to do that because doctors, orthos and GPs didn't have the confidence that they could finish those cases and they wanted to guarantee in insurances.

Today, we average like, what, John, 1.6 refinements per -- the algorithms are much better. Material has been better obviously. And what we're able to do is similar or better margin rates to just say, look, by the AA if you ever need it, and that puts in line with the patients need the doctors needs are with us and it helps us see our technology has really evolved in the sense that the doctors have much more confidence. They can close these cases and they don't need 5 years to do it.

Unknown Analyst

Yes. That makes sense. And John, you mentioned you're seeing this resonate with the DSOs. Like I guess, what's the feedback from some of the retail accounts? And is there some element of elasticity of demand with the lower...

John Morici
CFO & Executive VP of Global Finance

They like the options. They like the flexibility to say, look, I'll pay just for the niche case front and they like the flexibility to say, look, if I want to buy the product with extra service or extra confidence, I can buy that product, the 3 and 3, the 3 years with 3 refinements or the comprehensive unlimited, which is unlimited refinements over 5 years. And a couple of the case histories that we see where just 3 years ago, we put out a product, the 3-year with 3 refinements. And because before that, it was comprehensive unlimited. Now 3 years later, our best-selling product is just 3 years with 3 refinements. And it just goes to show you're selling to doctors the way they want to purchase, give them that flexibility.

This is another further example of if they want to have a product that is -- has a 3-year life on it with no refinements built in, that's fine. And then they'll just pay for them as they need them going forward. So I think it's the product capability that we've seen benefits on and then also the offering to give that flexibility to those doctors. That's what the retail doctors are coming back to us and saying that should be an effective way to go to market.

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

But the last part of your question, too, on the price elasticity piece. We know there's a big price elasticity curve in this business. And it gives doctors more freedom to be able to address that with their patients, too. So that's part of the deal.

Unknown Analyst

Got it. That is helpful. And then you're coming down on the upfront price. Can you just remind us, have you incorporated that into your LRP guide? And I think we've spoken about this in the past. You mentioned the 1.6 additional aligners. Is the way to think about it, basically, assuming that 1.6 additional aligners hold, it gets us kind of to the price where we are today on an upfront basis?

John Morici
CFO & Executive VP of Global Finance

Yes, because remember, the way we calculate ASPs, I mean, when you have refinements that are in future deliverable, we have to defer for that revenue. So when you have a product that you don't have future deliverable, you recognize all that revenue upfront. So it's accounted for the same and essentially, you're indifferent to whether you have one product or another. The cash is a little bit different. You get more of the cash on a comprehensive unlimited upfront versus later.

But from an accounting wise, you can see that benefit, and that's contemplated in our ASP. So don't think of this as, hey, this is some price change that's going to turn into an ASP or impact and so on. This is helpful from an ASP standpoint in terms of our numbers, and it's certainly helpful from a gross margin rate standpoint.

So when you think of our portfolio, when we have less refinements, less future deliverables, that's a higher gross margin rate on those products. So think of some of these products that are even comprehensive like this at 75-plus percent gross margin because you don't have to do all this additional treatment planning and then the manufacturing, the shipping that can happen several times later. This one is, in many cases, you could just do that initial shipment, and that satisfies and it does the case. If they need refinements, they pay for them later, but the gross margin rate on these is excellent.

Unknown Analyst

Great. And I did want to ask about 2026, not asking for you to give any guidance here. But how do you think about the growth levers you can pull to maybe accelerate from the low single-digit kind of total revenue growth we're expecting in 2025?

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

I look at from a regional standpoint, we felt good about growth in Europe and growth in Asia, particularly China and different parts of Asia overall, Latin America. So we look at that continuing. We think some of the items we talked about today that we'll be able to address more of a latent retail market in North America. We'll push -- continue to push our DSOs. Our portfolio expansion, when you look at IPE, when you look at mandibular advancement, those new products too, they'll have a whole full year of being distributed all throughout the world, too. And that will be another tailwind for us from an expansion standpoint, too.

John Morici
CFO & Executive VP of Global Finance

We'll leverage the work that we're doing in DSOs and continue to grow that, but really take that active conversion approach that we still need to spend that consumer marketing and getting that awareness. But if we can work with our customers and get lower down to try to drive that conversion at their practices, we think that's a good use of our spend, and that will be something that we continue next year. And it also makes it sticky too, where someone comes in, they want Invisalign, they actually get Invisalign that they want. And having that activity at the lower level at those practices, we think is beneficial.

Unknown Analyst

Got it. And I did want to ask on the iTero side. I believe you've mentioned in the past that you're ending servicing support for some of the older element systems at the end of this year or maybe starting in early '26. And I think you've said there's about 4,000 kind of earlier elements out there. Can you give us a framework for how we should think about a potential replacement cycle? And do you think macro conditions could maybe mitigate any impact of a replacement cycle in 2026?

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

I mean we will officially end-of-life those in January 1, 2026. We have good line of sight on where they are, what they do, how much Invisalign they produce. And we have a lot of options besides Illumina and our 5D Series to be able to back them up. So I don't think, Mike, there's any I mean, you go through end-of-life things all the time in different equipment businesses or whatever. The trick is always to make sure that you understand where those are that you take care of those customers as much as you can. And you'll see us -- we'll do a good job in the next 12 months to be able to switch most of those out to...

John Morici
CFO & Executive VP of Global Finance

Yes. And we're actively -- we have promotions and opportunities for our doctors to switch those and trade it in, get a new scanner. Some of them may be still even don't want to purchase a new scanner, there's ways that they can lease or rent and so on. So there's multiple options. That 4,000 is less now because many doctors have decided to do that. But we want to give them the best digital experience possible and having a newer scanner gets them to as it's more integrated into our systems. And -- but it's part of the cycle that you go through where you have existing equipment that's in the marketplace.

Unknown Analyst

Got it. And also on the iTero front, more recently launched the Illumina with restorative capabilities. Can you give us an update on latest and greatest trends there?

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Feedback has been good. I mean, it's in the fourth quarter, we had some issues on margin things for restorative kind of procedures and all that doctors weren't quite satisfied with. 5D Plus was fine, but Illumina had -- and there's different technologies we call white light and different things that we've leveraged with our algorithms. And the initial feedback, as we start to roll it out, doctors feel really good about it. So form factor on Illumina is good, speed is really good, breadth and depth of scan and all those things, making sure it's targeted at that restorative piece and they're comfortable is key. And I feel as we exit the fourth quarter, we're in good shape.

Unknown Analyst

Okay. Great. And I did want to use that to segue maybe into your efforts on driving uptake among GPs. I guess, can you talk to us how you're thinking about your efforts there? What's the strategy? And is that kind of resonating?

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's a multifaceted strategy with GP and you can somewhat regionalize it. But in general, GP as you start them out and you move -- they need confidence that they can do these cases. And so we offer TPS kinds of activities through doctors, meaning if GP doesn't necessarily want to take that full responsibility on themselves. They can hire or we help to hire an ortho or another GP to help them to the cycle, Dr. David Galler and [ Brian Moller ] are good examples of that, too. We also have what we call a GCP product, where we've done enough cases now. We have enough AI engine to say we've seen that before. And we can tell them exactly what that case should look like, and we'll back that case, too.

And so if you go to the years on how we work with GPs, it's about how do you gain confidence with them that they want to -- that we can move teeth. And with TPS, things like GCP, using AI on the 20 million cases we have done, we can really address that now much better than we could 2 or 3 years ago. And I think that's why you see our GP business continue to grow and doctors gain confidence with.

Unknown Analyst

Sure. And when you think about it internally, I guess where do you think you would see an asymptote in terms of the amount of practice time that a GP would dedicate to teeth movement?

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think it won't settle around one common mean with -- I think it will be a broad standard deviation. We know that doctors that work with someone like [ Brian Moller ] and David Galler, they'll move their GP practice to almost 50% of the revenue will come from Invisalign. And then they'll do other root canals and different things and drill and fill types in or applications.

Other doctors just want to maybe leverage their adult patient base to a certain extent, they want to sell -- they don't want to have it completely take over the action. So we see a wide variation in that. But as they gain confidence and they see that there's a lot less touch on those kinds of case, I feel like you'll see them doing more and more. They will because they just have more confidence to do it. And we have more tools to build that confidence with those guys.

John Morici
CFO & Executive VP of Global Finance

It also allows them to keep more of the healthy dentition. So if they move the teeth first and get them in a proper position whether it's an implant or veneer or others, you can keep that healthy teeth by moving them in the right position and then some of the restorative work is more minimal.

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

John makes a really good point here. So we have a product you'll see us rolling it out, it's called exocad ART. And so we bought exocad, 4 years ago or so the idea there was that we could leverage labs to do ortho-restorative procedures, meaning instead of if you're going to have a Social 6 in your front teeth capped, usually you might lose 30% of your enamel on your teeth because doctors will grind that down to make room for the caps. Actually, what we do on ortho-restorative through exocad and lab is we actually take a case and move those teeth out of harm's way. So you save all that enamel. It might take 3 months more, but it helps you to guarantee that you're going to have that dentition for life then. And so we're seeing that we're just -- we're launching it now through the labs. And it is a good uptake on it, too. And also, when you do implants, often, if like it's a back molar or something teeth move closer together, you have to shave off the adjacent enamel, you might only need 5 aligners to move those.

You can save them on those adjacent teeth. So we call it exocad ART. It's a primary reason we bought exocad. We'll work that through the labs. And like John talked about, we also have an over Invisalign art piece that works if a doctor wants to do that themselves and now have to work it to the lab, they can do it as a GP also.

Unknown Analyst

Yes, I attended the GP Summit in September. And I was kind of upside surprise there was a lot of buzz around kind of minimally invasive dentistry. I guess you talked about building confidence on the GP side. Are there any other impediments kind of broader adoption to call out? And if so, how are you addressing them? You talked about also the technology that you're improving.

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

I honestly think our key luminary doctors like Moller and Galler and different people here in the U.K., we have some terrific people that work with us on all. They are the key in the front lines for us to behind that, obviously, from our sales force standpoint, the products that we offer, or whatever, Mike. But it's -- so thing about dentistry, it's very fragmented. And when you're in the retail segment, there's a lot of different ways that doctors want to practice. And as John said, we want to sell and provide services the way that they want us to do that. And so a multitude of options about how to use our product line comprehensively or targeted wise, just if you want to save enamel, not necessarily worry about aesthetics, but worry more about functionality and maintaining people's dent issue. Does that make sense?

Unknown Analyst

It does. It does. And that was actually the first time I saw Dr. Galler presents but his character has got [indiscernible]

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Have to pay for that...

Unknown Analyst

Every room was packed. I did want to transition to margins. You've talked about at least 100 basis points of operating margin improvements in 2026. I guess can you just kind of refresh us on the moving pieces there?

John Morici
CFO & Executive VP of Global Finance

Yes. So some of it is related to products. When we have, like I said, products that don't have as many refinements of products themselves help drive improved gross margin. And then some of the other activities that we've done around some of the restructuring really on both sides of that spend. Some of it on the COGS side, where we're able to move some of the equipment and get closer to our customers, in some cases, saves a lot of freight for us, and that's a benefit, a large part, that's been done in the second half now as well as retiring some of the equipment that's maybe not as efficient.

There's still a lot of efficiency that we can drive in terms of whether it's the material costs or labor costs on some of the equipment, been able to get a lot of that changed out and in a better position as we exit this year. And then also on the OpEx side, looked at structures, panic control, doing things so that we're as agile and as efficient as possible.

So when we look at the 100 basis point improvement next year, some of it comes on the more variable side, gross margin side and then some of it comes on the OpEx side. But we feel good about how we're exiting these changes are being made now, and we'll be out of this year with these changes and really position ourselves for well into next year to be able to achieve the 100 basis points.

Unknown Analyst

And I don't know if you're providing this level of detail, but what's kind of the rough split of that 100 between growth?

John Morici
CFO & Executive VP of Global Finance

50-50, but maybe even a little bit more on the gross margin side.

Unknown Analyst

Okay. And yes, I was surprised to learn when you shared some info around the cases that get shipped out of Mexico for Europe. So I guess, can you talk about what the opportunity is like and the time to get to maybe supplying the vast majority of European cases out of Poland?

John Morici
CFO & Executive VP of Global Finance

Some of that is scale up of Poland, and we have some of that. Some of it is you just -- you have some of the VAT rules that you have to follow in terms of manufacturing, where you're manufactured and so on. So we have to do that. But yes, it's a savings more that we can service out of Europe with -- by Europe. That's a benefit for us, just like we do with the Americas shipping out of Mexico.

So you want to be as close as you can save us a lot of the freight. So we're on a good path for that. We've utilized -- we're utilizing our facilities more and more in those regions, and we'll continue to see productivity as we go into next year and really beyond because even we'll have this type of manufacturing for years to come on the thermal form. Direct fab will add to this, and we'll have some more of the direct fab manufacturing, but those have come out of those locations as well, and it will be for those customers in those regions.

Unknown Analyst

That was going to be my next question on the direct fab. Could you kind of remind us where we stand today and where we're going over the next 2 or 3 years?

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Yes, I'd say we are -- our resin is in good shape in the sense of we have to scale up a resin, we've talked about before, Mike, and it's a resin never been used before. It's a different source. And we made really good progress on knowing we can scale that and then we have the materials. It's not a petroleum-based product that's made from natural substances. So we've confirmed that we have enough supply of that, that we can make that work. And the product is consistent and stable in the sense from a reactor standpoint and when we use it.

Secondly, the process with Cubicure. We're scaling it up books in our labs and also in Mexico to start with. We've made good progress on it. Remember, we have to -- we're aiming to get to 1 million of these take time in order to get there. But our first product will be next year, you'll see us. We'll come out with the Invisalign first retainer we've been talking about. And we'll start trialing that in the first quarter of next year. Also preformed attachments, which are 3D printed attachments that we'll use that will give you much more exactness and predictable movements on T2 in the way they're placed. So I feel really good about where we are on both the process side and on the resin side. It's just time and distance now to keep us moving.

Unknown Analyst

Okay. Great. I think we've got a minute left. So I guess maybe just quickly, can you touch on how you're thinking about capital allocation and what are the near-term priorities?

John Morici
CFO & Executive VP of Global Finance

Yes. We talked about -- as we drive the business, we want to make sure we have our cash that we use and what we generate helps drive our business. The OpEx that we spend and just the operating expenses that we have. That's, first and foremost, to be able to drive volume, drive revenue. And as we look at some of the CapEx spend, it's been -- we talked about $100 million or so this year because even as we have some of the new equipment that we need for some of the direct fab and so it goes to our existing facilities, and it's kind of made within. So it's not a huge capital expenditure that we have. And there's no other spend that we have that's really outside of our business.

We've invested in some -- with some of our partners to help them grow more, and that's been worked out well for us. And then everything else has gone back to buybacks. And we've put as much capital into buybacks as we can. And remember, it comes down to U.S. cash, 80% of our cash is outside the U.S., but as soon as we've had that U.S. cash, we've been able to put that back into buybacks and currently have a buyback working now that $200 million will be done by the end of January, and we'll assess what we need to do for next year.

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

And the only other thing I'd add is we won't ever surprise our investors. We move teeth. We're not looking at any kind of diversification acquisitions or anything like that.

Unknown Analyst

All right. Great. Well, thank you very much. That's all the time we have. So Joe, John and Shirley, thank you for joining us today.

John Morici
CFO & Executive VP of Global Finance

Thank you.

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Mike.
