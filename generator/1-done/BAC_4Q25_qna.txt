Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.

Betsy Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I did just want to understand one thing on the outlook as we're thinking about the expense ratio. I know that you've got the accounting change, and you also have outstanding guidance for the expense ratio over the medium term, I believe it is 55% to 59%, is that right?

Alastair Borthwick
Executive VP & CFO

Right. Yes.

Betsy Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. I'm wondering, are you going to be adjusting that expense ratio guide given the accounting changes that you have made in this quarter?

Alastair Borthwick
Executive VP & CFO

Well, I don't think so at this stage, Betsy, but similar to our comments in Investor Day, the numbers that we put out aren't a cap on our ambition. So obviously, as we go through the course of the next couple of years, if we improved our efficiency ratio by a couple of hundred basis points this year, we're going to keep driving towards that range. And once we get in that range, we'll reassess and we'll consider whether it's time to consider a lower efficiency number in the future.

Betsy Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes, I was just thinking mechanically with the accounting change, the revenues improve, right? So with the denominator moving higher, shouldn't that target expense ratio of 55% to 59% move down a percentage point on each side?

Alastair Borthwick
Executive VP & CFO

Well, remember, we recast the prior periods. So that's already in there when you use the comparative periods. And I think part of the reason that it was important for us just to recast all the numbers and adopt the accounting is because that's how our competitors showed their results. So now we feel like it's on a comparable footing.

Operator

We'll now move on to Ken Usdin of Autonomous Research.

Kenneth Usdin
Bernstein Autonomous LLP

So just a follow-up, Alastair, you made the point about your outlook for fees is strong, and obviously, there will be compensation aligned with that. So just coming back on expenses in an absolute sense with 4% year-over-year growth expected in the first quarter. And I know everyone was thinking about how do you get to this operating leverage algorithm. Is that around what you're expecting absolute expenses to grow given your underlying base of good fee growth in there?

Alastair Borthwick
Executive VP & CFO

Well, I think what we're trying to convey is, and we've said this over the course of the past several years. Ours is an organic growth company. We're investing for growth all the time. And when we perform the way that we believe we can, we're going to create operating leverage every year. That's what our North Star is in terms of the financial model. So we've guided you towards NII, up 5% to 7% this year. We've said in the first quarter, we believe the first quarter will be up 4% or so. We've said that we expect the operating leverage to be a couple of hundred basis points. So that should allow you to work backwards into the expense side of the equation, especially since we've given Q1 essentially.

And then I think it would just depend on your revenue assumptions regarding assets under management fees, markets and investment banking because those will be the big drivers. And yes, we remain constructive on all three of those.

Kenneth Usdin
Bernstein Autonomous LLP

Okay. Got it. And then so -- as you think about your -- when you talked about the Investor Day, you talked about a 200 to 300 basis point range. So obviously, each year is going to be different things, but you've got -- with a strong base of NII growth and fee growth and we're on the 200 side, what are the things you could do to kind of longer term, expand that and potentially get back -- to get up to the 300 side of that 200, 300 range that you had given us in November?

Alastair Borthwick
Executive VP & CFO

Well, I think one of the things we've talked about when we went back to Investor Day, and this gets back to driving return on tangible common equity over time. You think about the fact that we've just gone from 13% to 14% last quarter. Prior quarter, we were at 15%. We said we're going to get in that 16% to 18%. If you think about the organic growth opportunity we have around deposits and loans, and then you add the fixed rate asset repricing that drops to the bottom line, and then you combine it with the fee growth that we've talked about. When we manage expense carefully as we have done this year and headcount flat, sort of the core expense minus BC&E and FA incentive comp closer to 2% type growth. Then you'd look at something that gets pretty interesting over time.

So that's what we're trying to drive over a period of time. And you're right, it won't always show up every year where it's exactly the same. But what we're trying to do, most importantly, drive organic growth, keep our expense discipline. That's it.

Brian Moynihan
Chairman & CEO

So Ken, the number one thing is to continue to let the headcount -- work the headcount through operational excellence and applications of new technologies, including AI that we gave you some sense for. So as we told you at Investor Day, today's activity in Erica in our consumer business alone is worth thousands of teammates that we don't have to have to do the great work we do for the customers.

So we've applied digital, and that's why we put the pieces in the deck that you can see in the Pages 21 and beyond. We apply the digital capabilities and now AI capabilities. And you saw during the year, the headcount was basically flat, while we added more people in the field facing off the clients and generating new client flows. And that's why when Alastair talked about the middle market business, particularly in the Private Bank business, why we're seeing strong growth there.

So it's going to be about bringing up the numbers of people down over time, and we expect the headcount to come down during this year. And each month, we get the -- to maintain neutral headcount, we have to hire at a 7%, 7.5% turnover rate. You got to think us hire 1,000-plus people so we can just make decisions not to hire and let the headcount drift down.

The team has done a good job, and we ended the year basically flat. And we absorbed, as Alastair said, 2,000 very talented teammates from colleges in July. And by the end of the year, we were down to 2,000 people and end up back net neutral. So that's what you're going to get there. If you look at the expense load, it comes from people, and it comes from the benefits and the compensation, and then ultimately comes from the buildings and computer systems to allow them to do the great job for clients. So that's what we're working on.

Operator

We'll now move on to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.

Michael Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

If you could just give more of an update on technology. What do you expect your spend to be this year versus last year, your spend on AI? And then Slide 21, again, we -- I think everybody appreciates the data you provide on your digital engagement, which is more than others. But no good deed goes unpunished. I'm just looking at Slide 21 and your interactions in consumer with Erica took a dip down in the last year, even while your users go up. So can you talk about the spend, investments and the results from tech and especially AI.

Brian Moynihan
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So Mike, we'll be up on initiatives this year, 5%, 6%, 7%, I think, types of numbers. Total spending $13 billion plus, $4 billion plus in initiatives, that's all new code. And in that spending, remember, also we get the advantage of all the other people. So for example, under the 365 Copilot rollout, which is now out across a total of 200,000 teammates and using it and learning from it, we expect to get good leverage of that. So that's an increase in the run rate year-over-year. So that's -- the technology is increasing. The technology number is sizable and the team does a good job in implementing change every weekend, frankly, except for 1 a year. So we feel good about that.

One of the things that you'll note is you use these technologies and combinations. So your point on Erica, I asked the same question, Mike, because it's pretty straightforward why would the interactions with Erica go down. The reality of that is what we don't show is the amount of alerts that we deliver. So you can set up alerts, which then has slowed down the need for Erica because the alerts are up to, I think, billions a quarter that are telling you when you're balance is low and things like that, to avoid you going and asking the question. So that combination of things is growing very quickly.

So again, what you always try to do is look at a process from a customer to you and figure out how you can get that customer the best client -- the best customer experience at the lowest cost, so you can plow that back into the low fee structures, which help us grow the business for, as we said, for 7 straight years in checking accounts. So there's a technical explanation on the Erica that is a little bit different. But thematically, you can see just the digital enablement just continues to grow and continues to help us leverage our franchise and frankly, consumers now pushing through 50% profit margin, and it will continue to go up.

Michael Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And specifically on AI investments, like how much do you spend on that? Or the number of people, or if you could dimension that and kind of what kind of outcomes you're looking for, especially as we sit here at the start of the year?

Brian Moynihan
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Well, we're looking for -- we have the -- to give you an example, we have 18,000 people on the company's payroll who code. And we've using AI techniques, we've taken 30% out of the coding technique -- the coding part of the stream of introducing a new product or service or change. That saves us about 2,000 people. So that's how we're applying it. That was this year's statistic, meaning '25. Next year, we should get more out of it as we figure out and apply it across. So there's 20 different projects going on in the company. I don't know off the top of my head the total expenditure, but it's several hundred million dollars.

Importantly, we're going through the company to generate more ideas how to apply AI. And I use example like our audit team has built a capability they think a series of prompts around doing audits and stuff to allow them to shape the headcount back down that they had to grow during the regulatory onslaught over the last few years. They're going to be able to bring that down.

And with AI, they'll be able to bring it down further, and they've laid out plans to do that. And so that's going on everywhere. But that was organic from there, starting to use the Copilot capabilities and then learning how to do the prompts and then using it to set up audit practices. So you're seeing it everywhere in the company.

So there's, I don't know, 15, 20 projects going on, and there will be a laundry list of much bigger size as we go through the company now and are generating ideas now that people are using it and getting used to how to use it.

We'll now move on to John McDonald with Truist Securities.

John McDonald
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

One of the other levers for the ROTCE ambitions that you guys have talked about is the denominator with the CET1 ratio. Could you talk a little bit, Alastair or Brian, about the time line for kind of where you are today with 11.4% to the target you laid out, which I think was around mid-10s?

Brian Moynihan
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think, John, if you think about that we're still, as you well know, and your colleagues will now, we're still waiting for the rules to get finalized and they're multifaceted rule set that we got to make sure how it applies. But our goal, we peeled from 11.60% to 11.40%. And you're going to keep peeling that number down through expansion of our markets business, expansion of lending and other uses of RWA. And so -- and we bought back a little more stocks and dividends than we earned. And so we'll keep working that down.

But the idea is not to take the $200 billion-ish nominal and reduce that a lot. The idea is to use the excess to grow the balance sheet and let that work down as we see the final rules, the constraint may be sort of tangible common equity ratio stuff or 6.20%. Could you be in the mid- to high 5s or something like that, that might be possible. And if you -- so we'll let this all drift down over time. And so just expect us to keep buying back the stock -- paying the dividend, increasing it and buying back the stock. And remember that as you said, we've drifted down a little bit by growth, but also the accounting change hit it, which will repeat.

So the next quarter we'll keep walking it down. Just the idea is as this rule settle in, then maybe we can be more aggressive, but we got to know exactly what we're dealing with.

John McDonald
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then maybe if we pull back just the broader timeline on the ROTCE path. It looks like for 2025, you kind of ended in the 14%, low 14s. What's the ambition to get to the lower end of the 16% and then the 18% over time?

Brian Moynihan
Chairman & CEO

I think we made it clear that you had -- and by the 8th quarter to the 12th quarter, you move in the lower part of the range and then the upper part of the range given a core economy growing it to 2.5% type of number. So -- and all the other attributes. So we made that clear. So that's basically 8 quarters from -- including this quarter, obviously, first quarter '26 and then we move into the 16% level, and then we move to the upper end of the range as we move through the third year.

Operator

We'll now move on to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.

Matthew O'Connor
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I was hoping you could elaborate a bit on your outlook for loan growth and some of the drivers. You've obviously been bringing loans quite a bit, and just well in excess of the industry and how sustainable is that? And what are some of the drivers?

Alastair Borthwick
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So embedded in our NII assumption is a loan growth in the mid-single digits, Matt. Obviously, we've had pretty good loan growth this year, kind of $20 billion a quarter or so. A decent amount of that has been on the commercial side. And we highlighted that in our financials and in our commentary earlier. So we're still seeing the growth in each of the consumer categories. And that feels like it's in a position where it's likely to continue to grow from here.

So we feel pretty good about those two. I don't see any reason that it would be a whole lot lower necessarily than it was last year, but last year was a good loan year, no question. So that's why we're saying mid-single digits. I think it will still be led by commercial. But you'll see the consumer categories picking up.

Matthew O'Connor
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And then I guess, specifically in credit card, the spending was good, up 6% year-over-year, but the balances were up just a couple of percent, fees were down. I know at Investor Day, you talked about accelerating the growth there. Maybe just update us on kind of the initiatives there and the timing.

Alastair Borthwick
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So our colleagues was very clear about this at Investor Day. It's our intention to continue to accelerate the growth in card. I think we've seen that in the last 3 or 4 quarters. It's picked up sequentially quarter after quarter. And if you were to look at what the team is doing right now, they're investing a little more for future growth. So you can see that in some of the things we're doing around the World Cup this year. You can see it in some of the things we're doing around more rewards in November. You can see it in our rewards program with our co-brand partners. And you could see it in the June cash back rewards offering. So we've got a lot of things going on right now that we're excited about. We know what we've committed in terms of higher credit card growth, and we feel like we're on the right path.

Operator

We'll now move on to Erika Najarian with UBS.

L. Erika Penala
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I just need to reask this question, Brian, Alastair because as I speak with investors, I think the communication on efficiency and expenses is a big part of what's holding down the stock. So just to clarify in terms of what Betsy was asking, she was asking, well, given the restatement and thereby higher fees, shouldn't you adjust the efficiency ratio range to 54% to 58% because you shouldn't get credit for the restatement, right? So that's why she was asking that. And I think what Ken was asking was, everything that Alastair mentioned, the curve, the growth capital markets, it's hitting this year, right? And so you're on the low side of the 200 basis point -- of the 200 to 300.

And so I guess the question here is what should we take away in terms of the expense messaging? Is it sort of what Brian alluded to that the headcount just needs time to work through and then you'll hit 250 to 300, and we just need to be patient. Is there more investment spend like you told Mike Mayo that you wanted to front load in a great revenue year. Like what exactly do you want your investors to take away in terms of how you're viewing the expense growth relative to your -- the revenue side? Because, for example, for your closest peer at JPMorgan, they grow expenses to $105 billion, no one really blinks, right, because of the revenue side. So what is the underlying message for operating leverage for Bank of America over this year and over the 3 years that is underpinning that 16% to 18%?

Brian Moynihan
Chairman & CEO

Let's back up to it. We -- as Alastair said, we are driving these numbers and they have improved on a recast basis by a couple of hundred basis points, and they'll continue to improve. And so the range will move down to lower numbers. And when we get into the range, we'll reset the range. But I think we're focused on the wrong thing. The question is, what are you doing now as opposed to what you're saying you're going to do.

We have a tendency to actually deliver as opposed to talk about what we do in the future, and that's what we focus on. So what have we done? The efficiency ratio came down a couple of hundred basis points on an apples-to-apples basis with the parts of the revenue stream that are least efficient, the Wealth Management revenue growing very strong in the capital markets revenue.

So when the Consumer Bank revenue grows and Global Banking revenue grows, the efficiency ratio they're at, they produce a lot more pop than Wealth Management, which has, obviously, the financial advisory tariffs. So we have to also think of where the revenue growth is coming from to see the improvement, but we moved to 200 basis points. We've moved in past years, when rates stabilize, we'll move it into the 50s. As you get the lower efficiency ratio, the operating leverage can be narrow and you still get a bigger earnings spot.

One thing that we've been telling you and that we want to make sure people understand is our goal is to keep driving all the extra NII to the bottom line meaning the difference between sort of the core and the repricing because we owe that to drive the returns up and the rest of it will have more normalized attributes to it.

So we've driven the efficiency down, and we expect to continue to drive it down. It is all going to be due to headcount because that's 60-plus percent of our expenses. We've absorbed inflation and everything, while we're doing that. The expense growth, Alastair just told you first quarter, 4% with expense increases and base increases and third-party inflation coming through, et cetera. So we're very efficient in each of our businesses, and we're very efficient relatively to our peers, and that will continue to improve. And that's -- I don't know how to do it.

One of the things when I talk to investors and I actually talked to people who own a lot of stock every quarter. Their view is stay away from -- focus people on the operating leverage in the company because at the end of the day, we've got to grow expenses at a faster rate, which we have been doing than -- a slower rate than revenue -- excuse me, grow revenue at a faster rate than expenses for operating leverage. We produced that for our last 5 quarters. We had 5 years of it leading up to the pandemic. You should expect us to get back on a streak.

But the reason why they want us to focus on that, the people that own the stock is to get away from the nominal dollar debate every quarter and get more focused on how the team is doing a great job of driving the revenue and driving the expense. The revenue growth slows down because the dynamics outside our company, the expense growth will slow down.

Operator

We'll now move on to Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities.

James Mitchell
Seaport Research Partners

Maybe just a question on deposits. We've seen 3 rate cuts in September. Can you speak to what you're seeing in terms of deposit pricing, whether betas are worse, better or worse than expected? And just also what you're seeing with respect to client behavior would just be helpful.

Alastair Borthwick
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. First, with respect to our pricing discipline, really when you talk about pricing, we're most focused on the upper end of the corporate banking, Commercial Banking, a very large Global Banking deposit base, where we're passing on rate cuts essentially the moment that they take place and in full. And so that's why you see the beta there, obviously quite high. Same thing in the upper end of Wealth Management. Consumer, you see much less in the way of pricing coming down because we have so much in the way of noninterest-bearing and checking and so much in the way of low interest-bearing. So we feel good about the team's pricing discipline overall. In terms -- and you should expect that to continue in Q1, recognizing that the rate cut was late in Q4.

In terms of growth, I think if you were to look at Page 7 in the earnings materials, it sort of tells you the picture. On the bottom right, you can see Global Banking. That's had a very good period of growth. Not sure that sustains at that sort of level. But we've had good growth in Global Banking. And most importantly, on the top right, Consumer has begun to turn and is growing. And that's the most powerful engine for us.

Those are the most valuable balances. We've now got 3 quarters of year-over-year growth. It's poised to grow, poised to accelerate. So that's very important. And Wealth Management is bottoming here. So we feel good about the mix of deposits changing in our favor this year. And we'll just need to make sure that we keep track of that through the course of the year, but we're pretty optimistic on that, Jim.

James Mitchell
Seaport Research Partners

Right. So I guess when you think about maybe inflection in consumer deposits growing, loan growth still strong, you have an NII target of 5% to 7% for this year. Could we just drill down and look at NII ex markets? It's grown about 5% over the past 2 quarters. Is that a reasonable growth rate for this year? Or do rate cuts make that a little more challenging? Just how do we think about the markets versus ex markets NII dynamic?

Alastair Borthwick
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So markets is going to benefit from a couple of different things. First, we obviously invested 10% plus into the Global Markets balance sheet. So that tends to mean that we're likely to grow NII, okay? Second, a big portion of that growth has been in loans. They're totally about NII. So that obviously is helpful. Third, when rates are cut, because markets tends to be liability sensitive that tends to be good for markets NII, okay? All those things are true.

And the only thing, Jim, that I was just making sure that I pointed out in my comments earlier was when we ended up at $15.9 billion that is what I would consider to be mostly all core NII. It just happens that we had about $100 million or so of Global Markets NII that I think will revert back to MMSA next period. So that's the one part that I just feel like is important for us to note. But otherwise, I think Global Markets NII will grow with the continued investment in loans and in the business over time.

Operator

We'll now move on to Chris McGratty with KBW.

Christopher McGratty
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Alastair, on the funding remix. I guess what's left to go in your view based on your core deposit trends? And how much of that is baked into the guide, the liability optimization?

Alastair Borthwick
Executive VP & CFO

You're talking how much of the wholesale funding can we take down over time?

Christopher McGratty
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Yes, that's right.

Alastair Borthwick
Executive VP & CFO

I'd say probably at this point, somewhere around $50 billion to $100 billion, just ballparking that between repo, CP, some of the short-term wholesale funding, institutional CDs that we put out there that are just quietly rolling off now quarter after quarter after quarter. So that's the sort of number I would use.

Christopher McGratty
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. And then just piggybacking on the loan growth comment. The optimism I heard on the commercial growth, I guess any asset class is perhaps not as optimistic into '26? And if I missed it on the card expectations with the proposal, any comments there about either growth or expectations for -- to offset that would be great.

Alastair Borthwick
Executive VP & CFO

Just restate the question one more time for me. Just say it again.

Christopher McGratty
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Sure. Expectations for loan growth, anything you're not pushing on for growth? And then given the President's proposed 10% cap on card yields, any comments related to that, related to your card strategy?

Alastair Borthwick
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. So on loans, I don't -- I mean, I'd say we're pushing for loan growth everywhere we can find good high-quality loan growth. So there is no place that we're not pushing. We obviously have substantial excess of deposits above our loans. So we've got a lot of capacity there.

We've got a lot of excess capital, we'd like to continue to deploy if we can find productive uses with our client base. So we're pushing everywhere. I think commercial has obviously had a good period. Wealth Management has had a good period, too. Some of that relates to things like traditional securities-based lending, but some relates to wealthy people looking to purchase expensive assets, and we're there to help them with that, obviously.

The consumer piece had been quieter last year, maybe picked up a little more this year. We can see the growth now in a variety of categories. Interesting to see home equity beginning to grow in variety and across time. Mortgage, a little more activity this past quarter, if you see our originations, you'll see we had more there in resi mortgage. So we're looking to continue to see pickup in consumer activity broadly. And again, we're trying to drive more card balances. So that's really important for us. That remains at the front of our strategy right now.

Brian Moynihan
Chairman & CEO

Chris, on the rate cap, obviously, you hear -- there's a good public debate going out there on the -- if you have unintended consequences of capping rates as has been proposed over many years by various components in Congress and stuff like that. The explanation we've always made sure people understood is that the -- if you bring the caps down, you're going to constrict credit, meaning less people will get credit cards, and the balance available to them on those credit cards will also be restricted. And so you have to balance that against what you're trying to achieve from the affordability.

We're all in for affordability. You all know how we run our Consumer business. It's the most fair to the consumer, and that's why we get good growth in high customer scores and those increasing. So we build a product to stop people from going to payday lenders. It's called Balance Assist. We've had 1 million -- 2.5 million to 2 million plus consumers have used that product to borrow a short-term loan for $500 or -- up to $500 for a $5 fee. We have a no-frills credit card with lower rate structure to it, and we've had 700,000 clients this year took that card. And so we believe in affordability. But with instruments that cap, you will see unintended consequence of that. And I think that's what you're seeing in the debate going on as people are making our points to the various -- the administration and Congress and others involved.

We'll now move on to Glenn Schorr with Evercore.

Glenn Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I think you brought up an interesting point -- getting people to focus on away from the nominal expense dollars. And you obviously mentioned the less efficient revenues are growing good from wealth and capital markets revenues.

So my question is in a good backdrop like we're in, good economy, strong economy, everybody has got a job, markets are doing well. If you take a step back, and you see flattish consumer deposits and down GWIM deposits, it's not what maybe you would have expected. And that's not a you thing, that's an everybody thing. So I'm just wondering if you could address that, even with 680,000 new checking accounts, like why do you think we see this sluggishness in deposits? And do you think we'll see a turn at some point in '26? Because that would help the operating leverage story as well.

Brian Moynihan
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So I think -- you have to think about what the consumer, especially in the -- even the wealthy consumer, they come to us for the transactional accounts and they come to us, whether they're savings money. And as market alternatives, off-balance sheet alternatives, money market funds, et cetera, ran up in rates, you saw a fair amount of money move in that, especially in the Wealth Management business.

What Alastair explained earlier is that's kind of all behind us. Now where the consumer has been stable and bumping along, the Wealth Management actually grew in the last part of the year. And so you're seeing it -- and these have settled into much higher levels than they were traditionally. So I think Wealth Management was maybe $200 billion before the pandemic, maybe $230 billion, something like that, $240 billion maybe, and it's moved to $280 billion type of level. So you're seeing a lot more cash stored.

So on the wealth side, it's people putting money into the off-balance sheet yielding things because, frankly, we don't need the cash, as Alastair explained on some of the things and then early on the rates paid and CDs and things like that.

And then secondly, it's actually the risk on trade that went in the market. And on the general consumer side, what's happened is that they fine-tune some of the higher pieces. And a lot of the decline in balances that we've experienced up until the last -- about a year ago, most of that decline was driven by wealthy consumers in our consumer franchise.

In other words, the balances for the people had less than $10,000 average balance before the pandemic or that were multiples of what they were pre-pandemic and then have been stable for the last few years. But the people who had $50,000, $100,000, $500,000 and average collective balances pre-pandemic were down 20%.

And with the percentage of total deposits there that drove it down on a relative basis, but again, that has stabilized. So we feel good where it's going. It's a lot of leverage. You have a consumer business, which has a 50% profit margin round numbers. And so it contributes to that. And if you go back and look historically, we have gotten that number down pretty far, and that has the biggest profit engine in the company is core to us driving that expense efficiency across the whole place.

Glenn Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. I appreciate that, Brian. Maybe just a little more color on your comment on the IB pipeline looks good. There's moving parts in the fourth quarter, so I don't want to overemphasize the revenue environment. But maybe you could talk about the outlook, it's expected to be a pretty strong year. The underlying conditions are pretty strong for cap markets activity. So my question is, do you feel like you've made enough investments to capture more than your fair share, pick up share? And do you expect as good as the year as I do?

Alastair Borthwick
Executive VP & CFO

Well, I mean, I think we feel good about both of those. We feel good about the deal environment. Brian noted earlier, second half of the year, investment banking fees were 25% higher than the first half of the year, and that's largely based on more and more certainty around tax and trade and some of the things that really matter to CEOs and CFOs and Boards of Directors. So we feel good about the investment banking environment. We feel good about our pipeline.

And yes, on the second question, we feel good about our investments. So you know this, Glenn, but for the benefit of everyone, we've expanded our local banking presence around the United States to improve our client coverage. Today, we're in 24 different cities. We've got over 200 bankers in a group that really focus on middle-market clients.

We've seen the benefit of that. We expect to see that continue as their relationships continue to grow. We're covering newer and emerging companies in things like technology and health care in a different way, earlier in their life cycle, and we're covering more clients internationally. So all of those places, we feel like are sorts of places that we should perform well. So yes, we feel good about that.

And then I'd just say when you look at performance overall, yes, we're at the top with some of the very largest transactions. So we feel like the franchise is in good shape.

We'll now move on to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.

Steven Chubak

So I wanted to ask on the GWIM targets that you had outlined at Investor Day. You saw some good momentum exiting the year. You outlined the 30% margin target with accelerating growth expectations on the organic side, but new recruitment does require some upfront investment. So I just wanted to understand what gives you confidence you can deliver both the acceleration in organic, while still driving better operating leverage?

Alastair Borthwick
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So I think if you were to ask Lindsay and Eric, they'd tell you, and if you ask Katy, they tell you that they enjoy significant competitive advantage as it relates to covering our clients. So obviously, we're in the wealth business, but we're also in the banking business. We have high tech, and we have high touch. We are digital, but we're also local, and we offer scale. And then in terms of prospecting for wealthy families to add net new, we've got consumer, business banking, commercial banking, corporate investment banking, all helping that group working together. So that franchise is one then that can deliver.

And if you were to look at what -- if you were to look at, for example, competitive attrition this quarter, the lowest we've seen in years. I think the Merrill FA see the value of our franchise and how they can help their own clients over a long period of time. And we're picking up the recruiting of experienced advisers. That isn't an enormous part of our strategy, but it's a -- training program so that we're training people in Wealth Management, Bank of America and Merrill. And that is what -- that's ultimately what we believe we can just keep driving in order to improve the net new flows.

Steven Chubak
Wolfe Research, LLC

That's great. And then just one ticky-tack question on the tax rate. First off, thank you for implementing the accounting change. It certainly makes our lives much easier from a modeling standpoint. I know that it appeared at least in the 8-K that there was a small stub of tax advantage investments where you didn't adjust the treatment. So I wanted to just understand if that 20% tax rate is expected to hold going forward beyond 2026 or if there's any potential for very modest but still a little bit of upward drift as earnings continue to ramp?

Alastair Borthwick
Executive VP & CFO

For now, I'd use the 20%. I mean, obviously, hence the guidance earlier. You're right, there are a small number of deals that don't qualify for the treatment. Now over time, all of those are going to burn down and burn off. And then in addition, you've got the question of whether or not some of the tax credit equity deals will end up expiring after 2027. So I think over a very long period of time, it's possible that the effective tax rate drifts up. But we'll be able to give you more guidance on that as we go through the various years.

We'll now move on to Gerard Cassidy with RBC.

Gerard Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Can you guys share with us, as you know, the GENIUS Act was passed and there's a lot of talk about stablecoin deposits. I think they're now trying to figure out how to close a loophole so that the stablecoin deposits cannot pay interest. If they are not -- meaning Congress, if they're not successful in closing that loophole, what's kind of the impact that you guys are thinking that could happen from this trend in stablecoin deposits?

Brian Moynihan
Chairman & CEO

So I think I would not -- look, we'll be fine. We'll have the product. We'll meet customer demand, whatever may surface. And so I don't worry about it. But the point we've tried to make, and if you look at some studies, I think, were done by treasury is that they say you can see upwards of $6 trillion in deposits flow off the liabilities of a banking system to the -- as the deposits into the stablecoin environment.

And the key of that is to think that the restrictions to be a stablecoin is basically think of it as a money market mutual fund concept. It has to be invested in only deposits, banking, Fed or treasuries in short term. And so when you think about that, that takes lending capacity out of the system. And that is the bigger concern that we've all expressed to Congress as they think about this, is that if you move it outside the system, you'll reduce lending capacity of banks that particularly hurts small-, medium-sized businesses because they're largely lent to end consumers by the banking industry where capital markets-oriented companies go off into the market.

So I think in the end of the day, at the margin, the industry gets loaned up. And if you take out deposits, they're not going to -- they're either not going to be able to loan or they're going to have to get wholesale funding and that wholesale funding will come at a cost that will increase the cost of borrowing. And so that's the issue that people have to struggle about.

Do I think it affects the course of history of Bank of America? No, we'll be competitive and drive it. But I think in the industry overall, I think it's something that we've expressed concern as an industry, and we continue to make sure that they see those issues as they -- our trade groups and others as they work through the funnel legislation. What will come out of it? I don't know in terms of adjustments or thoughts about that and they are working on it as we speak.

Gerard Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

And then just as a follow-up question. Obviously, you guys have presented a positive outlook for yourselves for 2026. The industry appears to be setting up very well with deregulation, steepening yield curve, healthy economic growth. Loan growth is picking up according to the H8 data. And as bank investors, we've learned to always look over our shoulder, but it seems like the worry now is there aren't many worries out there. Do you guys -- when you look at -- other than the geopolitical risk, of course, which is always a risk, are there -- what do you guys focus on just to keep an eye on in case something goes off the rails or something?

Brian Moynihan
Chairman & CEO

Yes, don't be a curmudgeon there, Gerard. At the end of the day, think about it structurally. We are always doing stress tests that reflect a 50% decline in house prices and market declines and all that kind of stuff, and we test ourselves every quarter. We have trading stresses that run every day. And so you're always trying to see, at the end of the day, whatever configuration of activities that produce as a result, the result that's going to reverberate into the global financial system, into the U.S. financial system, into the U.S. banking system is going to be the economy, right? The recessionary environment, a high unemployment, those types of things.

So what we do is we stress scenarios that produce those characteristics. But really, if you think about it, the stress test is going from where we are today up to 10% plus unemployment, house prices are down, as I said. They don't -- the way the methodology doesn't really allow you to adjust your operating expenses, which we know we would adjust. And you can see the industry pass those stress tests, and that's, I think, one of the most valuable things that came out of the regulation. And our goal is to get those fine-tuned a little bit so they don't swing back and forth depending on who is supplying to test, but the reality is it's a good thing, and we all support that. So I think that's the way to measure it.

Is there a parade of horribles that you can outline you started rattling off, and I could rattle off? Yes. But you sat there and said last year at this time, those same dimensions were in place 2 years ago, 3 years ago, 4 years ago, but we just don't see -- what we see differently than this maybe 3 or 4 years ago is the momentum in the market -- the capital markets activity in the investment in AI and the consumer spending is 150 basis points higher than it was back then in our customer base.

The credit quality is -- we're running at 40 basis points level. That's a level that is among the lowest in the history that we could find in a company going back 30, 50 years, these are good setups, but we're always worried about what could happen next, as you say, and that's why we did the stress testing.

That's why we have to balance, and effectively, that's why we drive responsible growth. We have a balance in lending. We're not overlent in any one industry. We manage those things. We make sure that we take the credit risk. We don't have a lot of stored risk that the industry had leading the financial crisis, meaning CDOs and things like that. So the industry is in pretty good shape, yet there'll be something that will happen, and we'll all have to adjust to it. Let's just hope it takes us longer than next year to happen.

We'll now move on to Saul Martinez with HSBC.

Saul Martinez
HSBC Global Investment Research

I wanted to follow up on credit. And I apologize if you addressed this in the prepared remarks, but it's been a busy morning. But your loan loss provisions and charge-offs have been particularly low in the last couple of quarters. And Brian, you just mentioned the 40 basis points being historically low. Wholesale also very low. I'm just curious your thoughts on whether you think we're at below trend levels of losses and in what categories? And is there a way to think about what more normalized levels of losses would be even in an economic environment that remains benign as we have now?

Alastair Borthwick
Executive VP & CFO

Well, you're right, asset quality has performed quite well. You can see that in consumer. You can see that in commercial. At Investor Day, we gave an idea of what we thought through the cycle might be. I think we said at the time, 50 to 55 basis points. So you can see right now the last 2 quarters, we were at 47 and 44 overall. So we're obviously happy to see that. We feel like we underwrite the right risk. We feel like we select the right clients. We feel like we've earned that and it happens to be a good environment right now. But maybe the 50 to 55 is the right number for -- through the cycle. No change to Investor Day.

Saul Martinez
HSBC Global Investment Research

Okay. That's helpful. And I guess in consumer deposits, you expressed some optimism that you're seeing an inflection there and some acceleration. Just curious where you think the growth can get to? Do you think we can get to mid-single-digit types of growth in consumer deposits?

And what are some of the variables that would drive that? Does it depend on additional rate cuts? And just kind of curious what you think a more normalized level of -- or not on a more normalized level of growth, but where do you think it could go to as rates come down and deposit growth starts to materialize?

Alastair Borthwick
Executive VP & CFO

Well, look, Brian did a nice job of sort of setting the historical context. We've had an enormous pandemic bump followed by normalization back towards something that would be more just normal for consumers in terms of what they would have in their checking accounts. That has taken years. But what we're seeing right now, Saul, is if you look at the checking account balances, for example, they're up a couple of percent now year-over-year, not 0.

So do I think it can go higher again next year? I believe we do. Historically, we might see consumer deposit growth at GDP to GDP plus type levels. Now that would put you in the sort of 4% to 5% type of range. Maybe we don't get all the way there this year, but we just come off a year where we added 3%. So we're obviously expecting and hoping for something slightly higher again in 2026 as we move to something more normal.

At this time, there are no further questions in queue. I will now turn the meeting back to Brian Moynihan.

Brian Moynihan
Chairman & CEO

Well, thank all of you for joining us. And just in summary, it was a good quarter and a good year, and I want to thank our team at Bank of America for producing it. We've laid out at Investor Day, the world-class franchise we have across all these businesses. You can see the performance continues to make good progress in '25, both on revenue profitability and returns.

The organic growth that I outlined earlier remains strong. The credit is very stable and very good quality. And we continue to manage headcount and expense as we talked about to drive operating leverage.

So thank you. We look forward to talking to you next quarter.

Operator

Thank you. This brings us to the end of today's meeting. We appreciate your time and participation. You may now disconnect.
