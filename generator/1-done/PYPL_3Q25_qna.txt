[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.

Tien-Tsin Huang
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I just want to ask about agentic commerce. It's a popular topic here at Money20/20, and I'm not sure how to ask it, Alex and team, but maybe I'll just rapid fire, if you don't mind. Has agentic commerce changed PayPal's strategic priorities in any way, which you're right to win? Can you fully fund investments here without sacrificing your incremental margins?

And of course, you've announced lot of key partnerships like OpenAI today, Perplexity, Google, et cetera. Do you have the coverage you need to drive ubiquity? Or is there more work to do on the partner front? It seems like there's a lot of talk about collaboration and you guys are definitely in the center of all that. So just love to hear your thoughts on all of that, if you don't mind.

James Chriss
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Tien-Tsin, and I hope you're enjoying Money20/20. We've got a good contingent there as well. To hit on a few of those, so first, from a prioritization, from a priority question, not really, right? Our strategy, we've laid out very clearly, is that we want PayPal to be available anywhere and everywhere that consumers want to pay. And we want merchants to be able to sell to consumers anywhere and everywhere. And we've talked about this even back at Investor Day where we laid out we want it to be online, we want it to be in-person and we want it to be agentic. And so agentic is just an evolution of this strategy.

In terms of our right to win, we actually think we're extremely well positioned to win here. Let me just lay out a couple of the different components. So first, on the merchant side, merchants are going to need to figure out how to integrate with each of these LLMs. And that's hard because there's multiple LLMs that are out there. And whether you're a large enterprise or a small business, you really don't have the bandwidth to go figure out how to integrate with each and every one of these LLMs, make your catalog available, understand the identity and fraud protection that comes with each of these different elements.

And so what we announced today was our PayPal agentic commerce services, which enables merchants to integrate once with PayPal, a partner that they've known and loved and integrated with for years, and be able to orchestrate their services to every LLM that's out there so that they get full coverage of consumers. So that is a huge win for merchants. We give them seller protection. We give them the ability to scale across all the different LLMs.

From the consumer standpoint, we're, again, very well positioned. We've got the largest wallet ecosystems that are out there and our ability to give consumers the trust, the safety, the buyer protection and the ability to get access and make purchases on any of the LLMs they want to is a huge win. They get to use the wallet that they know and love and have a great end-to-end experience, which includes not only the purchase through the LLM, but also then all the things that happen afterwards, whether it's package tracking or customer service or returns. So that's, again, a big win for consumers.

And then for the LLMs themselves, it would take over a decade if they wanted to go and try to build the same kind of merchant ecosystem of the head, the torso and tail of merchants that PayPal has established over the last couple of decades. And so instead, they get to partner once with us and get access to tens of millions of merchants with identity, authentication, fraud protection and payment processing on a global scale. And so we really feel like we are connecting this ecosystem together. It will take time for agentic to eat into overall purchasing. But if you think about we want to meet customers where they are, online, off-line, agentic and PayPal is in a very strong position there.

As far as investments, Jamie, do you want to hit on that?

Jamie Miller
Executive VP and Chief Financial & Operating Officer

Sure. So these partnerships do entail some level of investment, whether that's in product and tech or around co-marketing, things that really drive usage and habituation around the product. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we would be reinvesting -- begin reinvesting some of our margin dollars in the fourth quarter to really amplify some of our product initiatives. And between the push into agentic and that some of those investments are likely to be a near-term headwind to how fast TM dollars or earnings grow next year. But we are really excited about understanding what's working and really putting our dollars behind that in the core business in addition to really advancing our initiatives across the business on things like agentic.

James Chriss
President, CEO & Director

And the last part of your question was ubiquity. We obviously feel like we've got the largest breadth of merchants. We obviously have the largest breadth of consumers. And now with the partnerships, we've already announced OpenAI, Perplexity, Google, and as we look to partner with any of the LLMs that are out there, we think we've got actually quite good scale and ubiquity across the ecosystem. So very well positioned to win as agentic commerce continues to evolve.

The next question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein.

Harshita Rawat
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

So I want to ask about branded. I know you highlighted some headwinds in the 5% growth number. You kind of highlighted some kind of deceleration in the fourth quarter. But I'm also thinking you have some benefit from Pay with Venmo and buy now, pay later promotion in the holiday season. So going back to the Investor Day, you kind of laid out the path to branded acceleration. I know it's not linear. So how should we think about just the overall path from here? Or should we focus more on the Slide 4, right, like that you highlighted, which is very helpful, which kind of focuses on more diversified drivers of growth?

Jamie Miller
Executive VP and Chief Financial & Operating Officer

Yes. Harshita, maybe I'll answer that in 2 parts. I'll talk about fourth quarter and then really talk about the broader investor framework. We've had consistent mid-single-digit growth in branded checkout for multiple quarters now. And for the quarter, we've seen really good momentum across our growth initiatives with buy now, pay later, with Pay with Venmo. And we've seen continued U.S. growth at higher rates as well this quarter.

When we got into September, we began to see macro-related deceleration. And that is both in the U.S. and in Europe. And I talked about it in my prepared remarks, but really a relatively consistent number of transactions, but we're seeing basket sizes just trade down. Average order value being down, particularly in retail where consumers are just being more selective. And that behavior has continued into October. So obviously, it's really early in the fourth quarter. The holiday season is very back-end loaded. So it's something we're watching. But we did call out, and you're right, our guidance assumes a rate of growth lower than third quarter.

And so when you look at that macro and I pivot now to talking about the broader framework, we've seen very good progress. And I think what I'm most excited about is we know what's working, and we're really doubling down against that. And Alex has talked a lot about buy now, pay later. We've talked a lot about Pay with Venmo. And importantly, year-to-date in the U.S., our growth rates are higher than what we saw year-to-date last year in the U.S. So we're really seeing nice progress. But that macro piece of it, whether it's tariffs or some of this deceleration is offsetting our progress. And we set those 2027 targets, assuming a strong -- or assuming a consistent consumer macro environment. And ultimately, that's how we'll measure progress against that.

What I am excited about is we have scaled our initiatives in the U.S. first. And so where we see progress, we've got real confidence as we scale outside of the U.S. and internationally. I think we've invested in the right products. We're seeing customer adoption and engagement around the things we've talked about in addition to things like omni and places where we get other halo effect. And the investments we're making are really predicated on our confidence in our ability to continue to build on our progress as we get through the next couple of years.

The next question comes from Dan Dolev with Mizuho.

Dan Dolev
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Great results, as always. Just wanted to ask a quick question and a very, very short follow-up. So on buy now, pay later, huge momentum here. Can you maybe give us sort of the lay of the land, like how you view the industry? Who are you gaining share from most and in what territories? And if I just have a super quick follow-up for you, Jamie, on the investments next year, if there's any way to quantify that, that would be great. But those are my questions.

James Chriss
President, CEO & Director

Great. Thanks, Dan. And look, we're very excited about BNPL. We see this as one of those generational shifts that's happening now. We're seeing not only in the results, but also just as we talk to customers, particularly a younger generation is moving more and more towards debit and BNPL is the way that they want to make purchases. And we think we're incredibly well positioned to win there.

As you said, we're seeing good growth. We're actually seeing growth across the board. U.S. MAAs are up 21% in Q3. TPV continuing to grow pretty consistently over 20% -- and, again, this is a product that people love. An NPS of 80 is quite incredible. And so from a strategy and a share perspective, we think we have something unique. We have a brand that people know and love. We have a global scale. So not only seeing good gains in the U.S., but we continue to expand our global footprint. It just expanded to Canada within the last week or so and continuing to expand the offerings across the board and across Europe.

We're also moving to where customers want to pay as well. So not just online but moving in-store. We started in Germany and now expanding that in the U.S. So we really see BNPL as one of those growth drivers for us. The other big shift that I would want you to be aware of is most of our BNPL -- and again, we're on track to do $40 billion or so of TPV in '25. Most of that has come almost after they've chosen the PayPal button choice. And for many customers, that's actually too late. They want to make a choice upfront when they're making that purchase, and they want to see what that payment could look like if it was split into a few payments.

And so strategically, we're now meeting our customers where they are and think we have a really exciting expansion opportunity to be upstream and presentment. Again, with a brand that people know and love, with a product that they're already familiar with and using, when we get upstream into some of these purchases, we think we have the opportunity to continue to accelerate. So very excited with BNPL and something that we're going to invest in to win over the next few years.

Jamie Miller
Executive VP and Chief Financial & Operating Officer

And Dan, with respect to the second part of your question, it's early. We are still working our 2026 plan, and we plan to take you through that on our February earnings call. When you look at the types of investments that we're talking about, these are targeted really around product attach and habituation. So things like merchant co-marketing, cash back offers and rewards and things around better placement and presentment. So things that drive right back into the business and around growth, but we'll have some more information for you on that in a couple of months.

The next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.

Sanjay Sakhrani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

I want to dig into the really strong growth momentum at Venmo, where the revenues have been consistently growing 20%. And Alex, you mentioned sort of the multiplier of upside from here. Could you maybe map that out for us in terms of how we should think about the growth rate you've posted recently and what you could do next year and beyond, given all the different initiatives you have in place inside of Venmo?

James Chriss
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thank you. We, Sanjay, are equally excited about the trajectory that Venmo is on. So let me just pull back and talk a little bit about where Venmo was a couple of years ago and the contours of where we're moving. So Venmo a couple of years ago was an incredible P2P product, a brand in the U.S. that was a verb. It was the way a younger, very valuable demographic was moving money amongst themselves. So that was a very strong starting position.

The challenge was we really weren't meeting customers where they are. Money was moving from a P2P perspective. But then, again, if you were splitting a meal, you couldn't actually pay for that meal in person, you had to use a different instrument. We've expanded what Venmo means to this demographic. We're now meeting them where they are and enabling them to make purchases in person, online, move money between each other as well as starting to think about different experiences that they're having together, and I'll touch on that in a minute.

So if you look at what that means, it means that not only are we continuing to grow our active base. So MAA is up 7% year-over-year at $66 million. That's very strong. But now we're starting to see real penetration into 2 of our monetization levers. So debit card MAAs are up 43%. Pay with Venmo MAAs are up 24%. And this is starting to drive ARPA up. So ARPA is up mid-teens year-to-date. When you put all of that together, I still feel like we're just scratching the surface. If I look at us versus peers from an ARPA perspective, we are 1/3 to 1/4 of what I believe our potential is over time, and we're starting to now see really good adoption of the cards that we're putting in, the debit card and Pay with Venmo.

So again, all of the trajectory is moving in the right direction. And then what you're going to start to see on top of that is new products and services coming in. So the way that we've talked about it is, Venmo is a social product. It's the product that you're using oftentimes with other people. So you look at the announcement that we made yesterday with Bilt to be able to make rent and mortgage payments. Oftentimes, this is a demographic where they're making rent payments because they're living with others. And they were using Venmo after the fact to move money across. Now we're enabling them to make their rent payments and split their rent payments upfront with that kind of partnership. You're going to see more of those types of things from us over the coming months, as we start to think about all of those experiences that this incredible demographic is using, to be able to move money across.

And so, again, we think we're just scratching the surface of the ARPA that's available. We have good proof points of the monetization levers of debit card, Pay with Venmo, and now we're expanding into other experiences where folks can go. And our go-to-market campaigns are working as well. You've seen the success of the college partnerships that we put out, that drove over 1 million FTUs of debit card in Q3 alone.

So again, really, really excited about where this is going, and it's starting to bring in very, very valuable merchants as well. So whether it's eBay or Ticketmaster, Sephora, Taco Bell, DoorDash, TikTok, these are all merchants that really want access to this demographic, and Venmo is the best way to get access to them. So just getting started, excited about the growth trajectory, and we expect this to continue well into the future.

The next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.

Darrin Peller
Wolfe Research, LLC

Congrats on the OpenAI and the dividend announcements. I just want to touch on the exit growth rate of the year for a minute. I know you're guiding 2% to 5% for transaction margin growth. So maybe the puts and takes of what that could compare when you think about trending into 2026 and how we should think about next year in the context of the exit rate? And then maybe just -- I know you talked about investments being made, obviously, for all these initiatives. So how does that impact our thought process on operating leverage and just overall investment, EPS potentially for next year as well? Whatever you can comment, I know it's early.

Jamie Miller
Executive VP and Chief Financial & Operating Officer

Yes. Darrin, I'll stay away from giving 2026 guidance, but I will give you some color on the fourth quarter transaction margin dollars and what we expect to see there. To some level, we've got some impact from interest rate cuts coming in the fourth quarter. But really, in the credit business, we've got tougher comps. You may remember that we really got that business back to growth in the fourth quarter of last year. And so we just have tougher comps coming into the fourth quarter this year.

And I mentioned some level of investments in growth initiatives as well. And with what we're seeing on macro, we want to be prudent in terms of how we guide there. And then across the portfolio, the product initiatives, I think what's probably important to call out is that some of this goes through transaction margin dollars, other parts go through OpEx. I mean things like investment in product and tech and brand marketing, things like that go through OpEx. So as we work our plan, we work across all of that to really get to the right mix as we get into it. So we'll take you through more in a couple of months, but hopefully, that's some color for you.

James Chriss
President, CEO & Director

Darrin, I want to -- without going into the details for next year, I do, though, want to set a mindset for us because this is what we're thinking about internally. I've mentioned and we talked about it so far on this call, a couple of big shifts that we see in the market, and I want to call that out. We see 3 pretty significant generational shifts right now. One is a massive shift to digital wallets, and this is globally. The second is a real shift to buy now, pay later. Again, a younger generation that's now moving the way they're spending. And this we think can start to take share away from credit cards and be the way that this new generation is going to start to pay.

And then the third shift we talked about is towards agentic commerce. These are all 3 massive shifts that can recast the entire commerce landscape, and we think we're extremely well positioned in all 3 of them. If you look at digital wallets, we have leading wallets such as PayPal and Venmo we just talked about. And we have our expansion into PayPal World, which continues to connect wallets around the world. In buy now, pay later, we just talked about upstream presentment. We talked about the expansion and the trajectory we have there. And then we've talked earlier about agentic commerce and the shift that's happening and our ability to lean in and win.

The mindset that we have from a company is these are generational shifts that we are well positioned and we must win in. And so we are going to invest appropriately. Those investments may very well lead to some near-term headwinds in how fast TM and earnings grow in '26. We'll come back with more details as we think through that. But again, our goal is to win these markets and set ourselves up for faster durable growth in the future across all of commerce. So I just wanted to set that tone.

The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Wells Fargo.

Jason Kupferberg
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So you obviously had a nice beat here on TM dollars in the quarter. It seems like the branded business came in right in line with your expectations. The OVAS revenues were quite strong. So I wanted to just unpack the sources of TM upside in the quarter a bit, if you can give us a relative sense on how much of that upside came from the credit products versus some of the other drivers? And then just any quick comments on how you see cadence of additional penetration of the new checkout experience moving beyond the 25% level as we move into next year.

Jamie Miller
Executive VP and Chief Financial & Operating Officer

Thanks, Jason. Really, when you look at third quarter transaction margin dollar performance, we had meaningful contribution across each of branded checkout, Venmo, PSP, VAS and credit. And I think what's important there, and we really tried to highlight this in our prepared remarks as well, is that we've got nice diversification not only on the revenue side but on the margin sources. And I think that's demonstrative of that.

James Chriss
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And on the penetration, we talked a little bit about it. But again, just to set the tone, we really started in the U.S. We now are roughly 25% of global transactions. Even under that 25%, though, about half were actually optimized. And so we're really working through how do we nail the overall paysheet improvement, the biometrics that we're starting to put together. When all of that comes together, the paysheet and the biometrics, we're actually seeing conversion rates increase 2% to 5%. So we know we have a winning product. It just is taking time.

And look, I'm as impatient as anyone, I want to see this move as fast as we can. But we're talking about bending the curve on over $0.5 trillion of spend, and it's just taking time to get there. So we have confidence, as Jamie mentioned earlier, U.S. branded checkout is growing faster year-to-date than it did in '24. So we know the experiences are working. We're now rolling it out in Europe. We expect that to continue through '26. And in the meantime, we're leaning into BNPL growing north of 20%, Pay with Venmo growing north of 40%. And so we know that overall, in branded checkout, we're on the right path, it's just taking time.

Operator

The next question comes from Will Nance with Goldman Sachs.

William Nance
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I wanted to dig in a little bit on the BNPL volumes. So just a couple of questions here. I guess, first, if you could just quantify some of the run rate financial impact you're expecting on the Blue Owl offloading. I guess, just any help with the geography of those impacts on the P&L as we think about that going forward? And then just maybe a big picture question on the BNPL growth. Obviously, very strong. I think you've said in the past that the branded numbers are -- the branded volumes are roughly 40% U.S., 60% international. Do the BNPL volumes skew meaningfully differently? And just any color on what you're seeing from a geographical perspective in terms of adoption and penetration of branded volumes in BNPL?

James Chriss
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So let me take that second part and then Jamie can lean in. So BNPL, right now, we're looking at less than 30% of originations in the U.S. So this is still a very global business. But it's one where, as I mentioned earlier, what we're excited about is really an expansion of our strategy into upstream presentment. We think that's going to be a big, big shift and opportunity for us as well as a change as we start to expand into omnichannel.

And so being able to move buy now, pay later into in-store -- it's interesting, the dynamics of how we're seeing people shop is, it's not just hard lines of in-store or e-commerce. There's a lot of people that are shopping on their phone and then wanting to pick up in-store, and that's where they get the opportunity to do their buy now, pay later purchase. So all of this is coming together in a holistic product. And, again, we're seeing the flywheel effect of BNPL as well.

When somebody starts to leverage BNPL, there's a lift in engagement, their TPV is up 35%, and we start to see their ability to use us for all purchases. And so this is -- it's very interesting just to see the dynamics of purchase behavior. I think in the past, as e-commerce and commerce in general was evolving, there were much harder lines.

What we're seeing from customers now is, they want to pay when they want to pay. Sometimes it's pay now, sometimes it's pay later; where they want to pay, online, in-store or agentic; and how they want to pay, whether it's with their friends, whether it's with crypto, whether it's the wallet from their home country. And we now have a strategy that enables to meet them everywhere they are. So exciting trajectory there. And, again, you're going to see us lean in even more into BNPL over the coming years.

Jamie Miller
Executive VP and Chief Financial & Operating Officer

Yes. And with respect to the first part of your question on Blue Owl, we had a small impact in the quarter, but that was net neutral to operating income, which both raised margin a bit, but also was offset in OpEx. And with respect to '26, there's a small impact to '26 OpEx in terms of increasing the run rate.

Steven Winoker
Chief Investor Relations Officer

Sarah, let's make some -- I know we're past the top of the hour, everybody, but let's make time for one last question, if we can.

Operator

Your last question will come from Timothy Chiodo with UBS.

Timothy Chiodo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I think we've covered some great numbers on BNPL business today. I was hoping we could round it out with a few more, and this would help us in comparability to some of the competitors like Affirm and Klarna. I was hoping you could give a little bit on the mix of Pay in 4 versus some of your longer-term Pay Monthly loans. Also maybe touch on the loss rates. And then what I think investors really want to get down to is balancing those losses and potentially more favorable funding mix for the repayment. What really is the transaction margin dollar net take rate per unit of BNPL volume so that we could compare that to metrics like RLTC as a percentage of GMV for Affirm.

Jamie Miller
Executive VP and Chief Financial & Operating Officer

You've packed a lot into that. So I'm hoping I remember it all. Let me start with sort of thinking about unit economics on the core product. And first, with respect to what type of product is it, most of this is Pay in 4, Pay Monthly. We've got about an average turn on the portfolio of buy now, pay later of about 40 days. So when you think about that compared to peers, it is -- the duration of the portfolio is a much higher turn than maybe some of the others you look at.

Secondly, as we price it, our economics are on par or better than our peers. And -- but I -- the thing I'd really point you to here is when we look at BNPL, we do run it at the business level, but we look at it much more holistically at the total branded checkout or PayPal level around how do we habituate and engage our consumers around the brand and across the brand and drive sustained lift or a halo across that with BNPL adoption. It just drives stickiness. And we really see a 30% to 40% sort of incremental usage of branded checkout and that stays with us as the consumer continues to spend with BNPL. We're expanding through new geographies, as Alex mentioned, really focused on driving consumer experience and marketing dollars. But hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color as to how to compare.

Steven Winoker
Chief Investor Relations Officer

Alex, any final thoughts before we wrap?

James Chriss
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So thank you, everyone, for your questions. As you can hear from us, it is an exciting time at PayPal. We mentioned some of these significant generational shifts, and that makes it exciting to be at the forefront and a leader in this space. So we've got the right plan, we're making great progress and delivering results along the way, and look forward to updating you as we continue to make progress. Take care, everyone.
