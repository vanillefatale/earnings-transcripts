[Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Sathish Kasinathan with Bank of America. .

Sathish Kasinathan
BofA Securities, Research Division

Congrats on the strong quarter and as well as the closing of CP&P and Foley acquisitions based on what you have seen in the past 3 to 5 weeks since the closing of these acquisitions, can you maybe talk about some of the positive or negative surprises you have seen so far? And do you see any potential for acceleration of the 3-year time line to realize the announced $30 million to $40 million in synergies?

Peter Matt
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thanks, Sathish. Great question. Again, with the preface that this is early days in our ownership of this business, I would say that we have been really very pleasantly surprised with everything that we've seen. And I wouldn't say there's anything that's really come up that we weren't expecting on the negative side. And I'd say there are a number of things that are on the positive side that we've seen. And let me just give you a little story from one of my trips.

I went to a CP&P off-site, and it was a gathering of probably 100 folks from CP&P and then a couple of product experts from CMC. And 2 remarks I'd make that were, I think, super gratifying as the kind of new owner of the business. First is in the room, you could have been in a room with CMC folks. The cultural affinity is outstanding. And that was super helpful to see because I think it's going to make our integration efforts go well. Second was I noted that we brought a couple of CMC product experts, and there was a tremendous amount of discussion around kind of different opportunities that we and CP&P have together and a lot of excitement around that. So that was also super encouraging because it kind of validates the part of our investment thesis. In terms of the synergies, we are -- I would say the work we've done so far leads us to believe that we're very confident that we can get the synergies. What I would say is that it's early to speculate on the timing, and I wouldn't want to accelerate what we've said in the past. But we're very confident that the synergies are there, if not more.

Sathish Kasinathan
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. Maybe my second question is on the North American metal margins, which are currently at 3-year highs. Can you maybe talk about how you see this margin sustain or improve in the coming quarters given the context that we expect some new supply to come into the market?

Peter Matt
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Maybe I'll start on this going backwards and commenting on the new supply. So there's been a lot of talk about the new supply. And yes, there is new supply coming into the market. I think we've been consistent in saying that we're not overly concerned by the new supply. And that's particularly true in the current context where you've got much lower imports than we've had in previous years. So based on the level of demand as it is today, we feel comfortable that the marketplace can absorb the new supply as it comes in. And if demand gets stronger, which we believe it will, then I think it's fair to say that there's going to be plenty of demand to absorb any new supply that comes into the market. So we feel good about that. Getting to your question on margins. So in Q2, we would expect mill margins, so our steel product margins to be flattish. And that is taking into account the fact that we do expect to realize all of the November $30 price increase.

And -- but we also have seasonally stronger scrap in this period, and that will offset some of that. And in our downstream, we could see -- I think we think it's going to be flat to -- could be slightly down given the kind of the raw material pass-through to the fabrication business. But as we go forward, I think the shape of the margins is really going to depend on a couple of factors. One is obviously the supply/demand that emerges in the marketplace. And the second is really our TAG initiative. And I think this is an important point to make on TAG because TAG is all about growing margins in a sustainable way across our business. And what -- and we expect that some of that TAG contribution is going to come in the form of benefiting metal margins as we go forward. So we're very excited about that. And I think as we go into the back half, there's been a merchant price increase of $50 a tonne. We should see a little bit of that in the second quarter, but really, most of it is going to be in the back 2 quarters and any other pricing actions will really set us up for a strong back half of 2026.

Next question will come from Katja Jancic with BMO Capital Markets.

Katja Jancic
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Happy new year to everyone. Maybe staying on the more near-term, so you expect seasonally volumes to be impacted by seasonality. But can you talk a little bit about what that actually means? Because it seems that so far, we haven't really seen a material impact from seasonality?

Peter Matt
CEO, President & Director

Yes. It's a great point. We did have stronger volumes than we honestly than we expected in the first quarter. But going into the second quarter, we are expecting kind of typical seasonality. And remember, in the second quarter, we've got the winter conditions, construction slows down. And typically, there's been a going Q1 to Q2, there's a 5% to 10% decline. And we'd expect to be in that range. But I will acknowledge that the volumes have been stronger heretofore.

Katja Jancic
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

And then maybe on the West Virginia mill, can you update us what the plan -- the ramp-up plan there is?

Peter Matt
CEO, President & Director

Yes. We're super excited about that. Were you start one of these projects, and it seems like a long way off and now kind of were within 6 months of the start-up. So we've actually started some of the cold commissioning already. The hot commissioning, which is the official start-up, as Paul noted, likely to begin or will begin in June of this year. And we feel really good about it.

And just to comment on West Virginia, given the market conditions, we couldn't be bringing that on at a better time. But the other thing, I think, that really bears note is the fact that we are bringing this project in on budget. And I have to say hats off to the whole West Virginia team for the incredible capital discipline that they've shown in this project.

These are big dollar expenditures. You know, we're spending over $600 million on this project. And there's a lot of examples of projects that are kind of over budget. And thanks to the discipline that everyone has shown, we've managed to bring it in. And ultimately, that helps us from an ROIC perspective, which you know is a critical objective for us to improve.

Paul Lawrence
Senior VP & CFO

Got you. The only thing I would add to Peter's comments is just recall from a start-up perspective, this is a rebar only mill, different from Arizona 2. And so typically, based on our other rebar only mills and the fact that this is not near the degree of new technology being introduced as with AZ 2. We would expect to ramp the operation up over the following 12 months once we meet that hot commissioning start-up.

Operator

The next question will come from Tristan Gresser with BNP Paribas.

Tristan Gresser
BNP Paribas, Research Division

Yes. The first one is on the old division. If you can talk a little bit about the outlook for fiscal Q2. Also more specifically, what kind of seasonality usually do you see on the precast business? Is it fair to assume a normalized EBITDA quarterly run rate for precast and had a bit of -- I mean, because Tensar has been pretty strong as well. So I would assume maybe a bit stronger on that division, but yes, I would love to have your thoughts on that.

Paul Lawrence
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So thank you for the question, Tristan. So EBG, typically, there is -- as we've said before, there is absolutely seasonality in that business. As we noted in the prepared remarks, a substantial portion of that, most -- the lion's share of that is going into construction markets. So seasonality is definitely a factor in our Q2 is the weakest period. And I should note that Tensar in particular, with ground stabilization is kind of the most seasonal as we look at that business from year-to-year. So I think you can expect normal Q2 seasonality in that. Precast, so in our precast business, we think that will largely follow the seasonality that we have in our business overall.

And what I mean by that is our steel business overall. Typically, you've got -- in the winter months, you've got a reduction in the amount of activity that you see, and we expect that to be the case, too. So this is maybe not part of your question, but I'll go to it directly to say we expect in the second quarter, the precast business to contribute about $30 million of EBITDA, roughly speaking, which will seem lighter, and that goes entirely to seasonality. And as Paul noted in his comments, the backlogs that we're seeing are very strong. They're stronger than last year. And so we feel very good about the prospects for that business going into our ownership in '26.

Tristan Gresser
BNP Paribas, Research Division

All right. No, that's very clear. And going back to your prepared remarks on scrap sorting, how much of a benefit it's been? And can you give us some numbers in what you've been doing? And how has it changed today versus what you used to do in the past in terms of using less scrap and varying the quality of the scrap? Any color there would also be great.

Peter Matt
CEO, President & Director

Yes. We -- I mean, we -- I'll start and then Paul can jump in with any additional comments. But I guess what I'd start by first saying is that in the past, we talked about the scrap optimization being, I think it was a $5 million to $10 million opportunity. And that has grown substantially.

And I think the key point is that we started out in a couple of mills and now we're pushing it to other mills. So we're getting the benefit across our broader footprint.

And there are two points, as you said. One is in the quality of the scrap. We've done a tremendous amount of work in the quality of the scrap and we've identified places where, for example, we're using a lot more shred than we need to use. So we can cut back on the shred and that obviously kind of reduces scrap costs and so forth.

We've also done a tremendous amount of work on yield. And that has helped us a lot in terms of obviously using less scrap to produce the tonnes that -- and sell the tonnes that we want to produce and sell. Paul, anything?

Paul Lawrence
Senior VP & CFO

The only thing I would add, Tristan, is, as we've noted, what we achieved last year was approximately $50 million from TAG. And I would say those two initiatives, just given the dollars involved that Peter outlined, probably we're near half of the realization that we had last year. And as Peter said, those were piloting the initiatives in a few locations and growing throughout both '25 and '26 and incremental number of mills to get it across the entire platform. And so we are very excited about the opportunity of those initiatives to continue to contribute well to our business.

Peter Matt
CEO, President & Director

One thing that's maybe worthy of an additional comment vis-a-vis TAG is, and this goes for a lot of our TAG initiatives. What we found is that on something like scrap optimization, it started out in one mill. And then you start to see these real benefits in the mill. And of course, every mill manager wants to run their mills as well as they possibly can. So there's been this kind of compounding effect as more of the mills take it on and bring it into full bloom.

So -- and that's, I think, a characteristic of the TAG program in general. And one of the things that we're super excited about. We see new initiatives coming in and sizable new initiatives coming in. And we got to build the charters and plans around these different initiatives, but you can see how this can be really a game changer.

And as we've talked about in the past, again, the goal is long-term sustainable margin improvement over what we would be otherwise, right? So if X was our historical margin, we want to be at X plus Y. And we're working internally on some tools to help you all define that. But we believe that there is through TAG the opportunity to make our business durably better? And I think that will be a really important contributor to value.

The next question will come from Alex Hacking with Citi. .

Alexander Hacking
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Happy new year, everyone. I guess, first question, you mentioned increased commercial selectivity in rebar fab and part of that was about reducing risk. Has counterparty risk been rising? And is there a reason why?

Peter Matt
CEO, President & Director

Why reduce -- let me just make sure I understand your question, why we're addressing that point?

Alexander Hacking
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Sorry, the question was has counterparty risk been rising and why is counter party risk been rising if it has been rising?

Peter Matt
CEO, President & Director

Yes, I wouldn't say it's been rising. I would say this is a risk that we have taken historically that we are looking to reduce in the portfolio. And where it manifests itself is, Alex, is in our fabrication business and some of the contracts will be asked to do longer-term jobs. And a lot of times, those longer-term jobs can be at a fixed price. And of course, our raw material inputs can change. So you can get out 2 years or 3 years, and there have been some instances with this company in the past, and I'm sure others where you get -- you can get upside down on a project.

And what we're trying to do is to reduce that risk by making sure either through proper escalators, proper indexing that we are being compensated for that risk so that, again, it goes back to the ROIC point that in any environment, we are generating a good return on the capital that we put in, which is substantial in a business like this.

Paul Lawrence
Senior VP & CFO

And I just to reiterate and make sure it's clear, counterparty risk, we have historically never had an experience of significant counterparty risk and nor do we see that really going forward with the structure of how the construction contracts are written. This is all about reducing the risk, as Peter said, around margin preservation and ensuring we're getting a good margin on the job.

Alexander Hacking
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I get it. I guess I misinterpreted. And then on our, as you mentioned, the importers have been getting ahead of CBAM. How -- I mean do you have any idea like how long it could -- how many quarters it could take for prices in Europe to stop benefiting from CBAM?

Peter Matt
CEO, President & Director

Yes. So again, it took effect January 1. And our read on the situation is for certain importers, the average impact on them could be EUR 50 a tonne. And for many of them, it could be higher initially because they have to be qualified to get to the EUR 50 a tonne. And before they're qualified, there's a default rate that's even higher. So this is going to play out over the course of calendar 2026. I think it's fair to say you've probably noted in the import numbers that there was a large -- there was a kind of a large pre-buyer of incremental tonnes coming into Europe that probably -- before CBAM, excuse me, that will probably delay the impact of the CBAM credit that we should be getting. But I do believe in the -- by the time we get to the -- we'll get a little bit of it in our second quarter and in our third and fourth quarters, we should see a substantial portion.

And certainly, over the course of the year, the calendar year, it should roll in. The other thing to note is that in addition to the CBAM there is also this safeguard mechanism that was renegotiated by the EU. And the safeguard mechanism, remember, that's effectively a quota system. And in the revised safeguards, the quotas are reduced by 50% and the tariffs for being above the quotas are increased by 50%. That should come into effect in the middle of the year, and that should be only additive to the situation in Europe. And just to frame it a little bit for you, if you think about our production capability in Poland and you think about the $45 million of CO2 credits we get, that's about a ton above our breakeven operational performance today. And then add EUR 50 to that, all of a sudden, you start to get to numbers where we are running at levels at or above our through-the-cycle performance. So again, this is not something that's going to happen overnight. But in addition to all the other catalysts in Poland, I think it's reason for some real optimism.

The next question will come from Timna Tanners with Wells Fargo.

Timna Tanners
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to car in my questions to trade. So you talked about the CBAM implications helping pricing. But I think another aspect of CBAM is that it helps domestic producers in Europe perhaps take some market share. So curious about what volume impact you might see there? And then I have a follow-up on the U.S. trade side.

Peter Matt
CEO, President & Director

I think that it's a fair point that you're making, and I think there are some volume opportunities.

We have been running at, I would say, a relatively good rate of production recently. So I think there is some volume opportunity for us, but I wouldn't say it's huge at this point.

Timna Tanners
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. Second question. On the U.S. side, I know you mentioned, of course, Algeria, Bulgaria, Egypt, Vietnam. But if you look at the latest trade data, actually imports are coming again from Turkey and from what I think Portugal and Spain.

So just any thoughts on the Turkish side and also maybe Portugal and Spain keep more production domestic and that falls off. But it does seem like the other countries, the four you mentioned, are already shrunk in terms of importance, probably because of the filing of the case even before any decision.

Peter Matt
CEO, President & Director

Yes. No, it's a great point. We've definitely seen some pullback in the imports from those countries.

And I'll just remind you and others that those countries in 2005, the trade case countries imported about 500,000 tons of steel into the U.S. So if there was an outcome that's anything like what we have on the Algeria case on a preliminary ruling, I think that's going to be really helpful in terms of keeping those imports out of the country.

And remember, on those trade cases, these are 5-year terms before the sunset review. So it's quite a durable point.

I think to your question on Turkey, we have noticed that Turkey has increased their shipments. We'll have to watch that.

Again, in the context of overall imports today, we're not overly concerned about that. But again, we'll be watching that carefully to see -- to make sure that to make sure that what they're importing, they're importing of a fair trader.

Operator

The next question will come from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan.

William Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. Thanks, everyone. Happy New Year, and thanks for all the color on the call thus far. I wanted to ask about AI, how the ramp has progressed -- how the ramp progressed during the prior quarter and what utilization you're running at? And then how should we think about operations and utilization ahead?

Peter Matt
CEO, President & Director

Yes. AZ 2, we've said in the past that this has been a challenging one, and my comments will cover that a little bit. But I think it's -- the important point is we reached profitability on EBITDA in the fourth quarter, and we were nicely profitable in the first quarter 2, and we expect to be nicely profitable throughout the year there.

In terms of utilization rates, we exited last year at about 60%. We expect to demonstrate full run rate during our fiscal year 2026. But we don't expect to be at full run rate in 2026. And that is because we still have a number of merchant specs that we've got to perfect, and that's going to take some time, and it will force us to run at kind of suboptimal utilization. But we feel good about where we are.

There's still some challenges there to be clear. But the team has done an incredible job. And this is where I think the CMC team really shines because we have drawn people and expertise from all across our network to help us with this operation.

And remember, the challenge is this isn't your grandfather's steel mill, so to speak, right? This is a very innovative steel mill. It will be a workhorse in our portfolio, but there's a lot of new technology to make work.

And the other challenge that we've had there, Bill, is just with the kind of the people not from the vantage point of the people are good, the people are great, but it takes some training to learn this. And so we've done a lot of work around training, and I think that's enhancing our reliability substantially, and it will continue to do so as we go through the year. So hopefully, that helps you.

William Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes, it does. And then my second question, can you speak a bit more to the pricing profile of your downstream backlog and whether new order entry continues to be priced higher than what's in the backlog? And I guess, to what extent is the commercial discipline/ag initiatives you spoke of earlier playing a role?

Peter Matt
CEO, President & Director

Yes, absolutely. So we do continue to see prices improve in our downstream. So we're -- we have been really for the last couple of quarters, putting new orders into the backlog at higher prices. So that continues, and we feel good about that progression. And actually kind of starting out the year, we've had a couple of new orders that have come in, in a really nice place. So I think we feel good about that.

And again, demand has -- in that business remains very solid. And so there's a lot of project activity and a lot on the drawing board. So we're optimistic about where things go there.

Operator

The next question will come from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley.

Carlos de Alba
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes. Thank you very much. Happy new year, everyone. So maybe just add in to the discussion on the new commercial approach in the fabrication business. How much of your business is already in this indexed format where you are able to maybe better protect your margins? And how do you see that evolving in the coming quarters is still not a big percentage of the overall business?

Peter Matt
CEO, President & Director

Yes. It's not a big percentage today. and the openness to it among the customers can vary, right? So there are some DOTs, for example, that are more inclined to it than others. So we're working from a relatively low base on that, but we do see the opportunity to increase it and to open the dialogue with customers on indexation.

And indexation is just one of the strategies, right? The other obvious strategy there is just proper escalation. And when you talk about commercial excellence, one of the things that we've been, I think, showing -- the team has done an amazing job on being more disciplined about this is in making sure that, number one, we have proper escalators in place. And then number two, that we're actually enforcing those escalators as we go through kind of go through the period.

So this is a journey. But the way we think about it internally is that over time, it doesn't make sense for companies like CMC to take this type of risk in the way that we've been taking it. And over time, we will work towards reducing that. And that will again contribute to higher margins through the cycle, higher returns, more consistent returns, all the things that we're pointing towards.

Paul Lawrence
Senior VP & CFO

And Carlos, I'd just add what we've spoken of is really around protecting the risk from a duration perspective. There's also recognizing the value that CMC brings from a reliability perspective. And I think that is also critical in terms of our capabilities and ensuring we get value for the service we bring.

There's a tremendous amount of risk to a construction project that comes with all the subcontractors. Having a reliable partner as CMC is drives a higher value recognition. And we got to make sure we capture that.

Carlos de Alba
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

That makes sense. And then what is the EBITDA margin that your $160 million to $170 million EBITDA guidance for CSG represent? And would you say that this guidance -- this EBITDA guidance is somewhat conservative given that you're just starting to take over those assets?

Peter Matt
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I mean, Paul, you can comment on the margin, but the -- I would say, look, it's early days, right? And we're doing a lot of work on integration. As I said at the very beginning, we feel kind of good about what we've seen, but there's some adjustment that has to happen as you bring a new company into our company.

And so maybe we're being a little bit conservative, but I think it's appropriate to be cautious. And again, our goal with all of you and with all of our investors is to be in a situation where we are under promising and over delivering. And that's what we're shooting to do here.

Paul Lawrence
Senior VP & CFO

And as far as the margins are concerned, it will be made up of the two buckets. Our existing business typically is in the high teens, so call that 18% to 20% margin. We would expect that to remain there. And the precast business combination of the two entities to be in the 30% to 35% range from a margin perspective. So no change. Obviously, it's just a different mix going forward than what we've had historically.

Carlos de Alba
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. Yes, I missed the spoke a period the $165 million to $175 million EBITDA guidance is not for CSG. It's not the precast.

Operator

The next question will come from Mike Harris with Goldman Sachs.

Michael Harris
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Just one quick question on my part. When I look at the TAG program, I think last quarter, the expectation for the expected run rate annualized EBITDA benefit at the end of '26 was greater than 150. And now you're saying 150. So does that change just a function of timing? Or did you adjust your initiative list or just being conservative.

Peter Matt
CEO, President & Director

No, I think -- I don't think it was greater than 150. I think we have moved towards 150 as we've gotten more clarity on the opportunities in TAG. And by the way, as we've said in many other forums, this is just the beginning, right? So it's not like 150 is the end. As we get more fidelity around this that we will share more.

What we're really doing in TAG is we're trying to build durable margin improvement. So rather than throw lots of programs in that we haven't fully vetted or we haven't done the work to make sure that they deliver and they deliver on a sustainable way we're proceeding a little bit more slowly, but I think the outcome will be something that's more lasting.

Operator

The next question will come from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Philip Gibbs
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Sorry if this question was asked earlier, but what is the typical seasonality of the North American business from a volume standpoint relative to Q1?

Paul Lawrence
Senior VP & CFO

Typically, Phil, it's in the 5% to 10% range that we would expect. Obviously, that is very much weather dependent. And we've seen some inclement weather in the West Coast, certainly Nationally, it's been pretty good so far, but we were only in the early innings of the winter. So typical is 5% to 10%, and that's what we're guiding towards.

Philip Gibbs
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

And in terms of integrating just baseline depreciation, I'm assuming you're going to have some write-ups associated with the precast deals. I think your baseline for D&A was like $70 million or $75 million in Q1. So what should we be anticipating for Q2?

Paul Lawrence
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, it's a great question, Phil. And as we have owned these businesses just for a short period of time and the complexity of some of the purchase accounting, we're not in a place from a D&A perspective, well, really an amortization perspective to provide guidance. There's a lot of intangibles associated with the businesses, and they all have different valuation approaches and durations.

And so what we know is cash flow. The cash flow of these businesses will be certainly very attractive, as we outlined at the acquisition. We were able to achieve the financing at very attractive rates in November and excited about the conclusion of the financing. But as far as the accounting, we are not yet in a position to really provide much outline in terms of what the amortization will be.

At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Matt, I'll now turn the call back over to you.

Peter Matt

At CMC, we remain confident that our best days are ahead the combination of structural demand trends, operational and commercial excellence initiatives to strengthen our through-the-cycle performance and value-accretive growth opportunities create an exciting future for our company. Thank you for joining us on today's conference call. We look forward to speaking with many of you during our investor calls in the coming days and weeks. Thank you.
