[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.

Christopher Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So my first question is about just how you're thinking about the trend in the business in light of the performance that you've seen over the past 6 months and a harder compare and then into '26. So you noted that quarter-to-date is positive. Is there anything you could elaborate on that? And is the flat guide for the fourth quarter simply just like, hey, there's uncertainty and there's a harder compare.

And then as you think to '26, if the home improvement market is flat to slightly down this year and you're putting up a flat comp. If you take a look at the sum total of everything a little bit of lower rates, a little bit of replacement cycle, a little bit of innovation and what you're doing on the self-help side, should your sort of -- should the market and should Lowe's comp accelerate in '26 relative to '25?

Marvin Ellison
President, CEO & Chairman

Chris, this is Marvin. Bill and I will talk about November then we'll let Brandon share a tiny bit about how we think about '26 because as you can respect, we're not going to get into a ton of detail about that until our February call, we'll provide guidance for the year. Relative to November, look, we're very pleased with the positive comp performance to start the quarter in spite of storm overlaps from last year. We've seen improvements in the top line since exiting October. And we just believe that some of the key elements of our Total Home strategy are working and we're excited about November because there are some great things on tap. So I'm going to let Bill talk a bit about November, but also talk about appliances, which we think is really key to our performance, not only for the quarter, but what we're seeing in November.

William Boltz
Executive Vice President of Merchandising

Yes. Thanks, Marvin. And Chris, we're excited about kind of the early start to the quarter, obviously, coming off of October. Strength for us really broad-based across the store, but particular strength within our seasonal categories, holiday, Trim A Tree, tools, appliances and other gift-related businesses that are getting off to an early start. Our stores look great. We're starting to see live trees show up now. Poinsettias showing up now as we get ready for next week. And we're seeing some early excitement around some key areas of the store. So whether it's by now and installed by the holidays within our flooring and cooking areas or you look at cobalt and some of the strength that we're seeing there with some new products in workstations, the buy and get offers within our tool business, driven by DEWALT, Craftsman, and Kobalt.

We've got just a lot of strength going on right now that we'll carry into next week with Black Friday. So we're excited about how things are progressing. And in our appliance business, we've had really since last year, 4 straight quarters now of comp growth and unit growth, which is telling us the health of that business and that consumer responding to the offers and the innovation and the new products that the team has put up.

Brandon Sink
Executive VP & CFO

And Chris, this is Brandon. I think when I step back and look at the totality of the year, we're now 3 quarters of the way through, obviously, navigating a lot of factors, a very choppy macro. But when I look at just the trends of the business, I think a lot for us to be cautiously optimistic about as we look ahead to '26. We're seeing acceleration on 1-year comps when you exclude storm-related activity for Q3 and what's implied in our Q4, also 2-year comps accelerating nicely as we've moved through the year, ongoing strength in Pro online.

Bill just spoke to appliances, some early signs of life in our home services business, which is really positive. We cited broad-based performance across categories with 10 or 14 categories, geographies broad-based, really excited about FBM and ADG as we start the integration efforts. And obviously, just really pleased with the bottom line performance and the ongoing operational discipline that the company and has been able to show. So please through 3 quarters. And as we look ahead into 2026, as Marvin mentioned, we'll have more to come in February, but those are early thoughts.

Christopher Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And then on a related question, I mean, kitchen and bath, I think you said it was positive looking back, it seems like you'd have to go all the way back to 1Q '23. What's changed there? And as you think about it, Marvin, you've talked about like we have a lot of big ticket. We have a line remodel, the kitchen and bath, the appliances. And when we sort of need lower rates to improve that sort of big-ticket remodel category, but you are seeing signs of life. So is there sort of a misperception around sort of how remodel-oriented you are amongst investors or how do you think about maybe that category showing signs that it will inflect to the positive?

Marvin Ellison
President, CEO & Chairman

So Chris, I think it's 2 things. I'll take the first part, and I'll let Bill just talk about some of the work in resets and new products. I really believe that this is more about lowest taking share in this space. If you can go back to 2018 at our first Analyst and Investor Conference, I presented how we were managing this installed business with binders and whiteboards. And it's taken us a while, candidly, to get this business digitize with a technology platform that makes this entire process easy for the associate, the installer and most importantly, the customer. We think now we have a best-in-class tech stack for this space. We have central selling and so what you're looking at outside of kitchen and bath, which Bill will speak to, you see in categories like windows and doors in HVAC and water heaters.

These are more replacement categories for customers who are living in the oldest housing stock in the history of the U.S., but because we have a better go-to-market strategy. Bill's teams given this great pricing. Brandon seems given us a great credit portfolio we're taking share in this area. But we're also seeing, to your point, signs of life in areas that make us cautiously optimistic that maybe there are brighter days ahead.

And I let Bill talk about some of those categories.

William Boltz
Executive Vice President of Merchandising

Yes. So Chris, I'll mention in my prepared remarks that during the quarter, we had completed our vanity reset across the stores. And that's one of the nice bright spots driven -- driving our kitchen and bath business. But we're also seeing broad-based strength, toilets, bathing, faucets, disposable kitchen sinks, bath repair. So it's really kind of broad-based across the categories. We're excited about that. But it really boils down to the strength. I think we're also seeing within our central selling organization where the store associates take the lead. We get -- turn it over to our central selling team, and they're helping to close the deal on a kitchen cabinet. The strength of what Joe's team is doing in the store to take good care of the customer. There's just a lot of things that are adding up to the strength of the kitchen and bath business, but those are just a few highlights.

Our next question is from the line of Zack Fadem with Wells Fargo.

Zachary Fadem
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to follow up on your comments around improving Pro survey sentiment. And I'm curious if there's any extra color you can talk through in terms of how that's trended through the year? To what extent do you think this is a good leading indicator for your business? And then what do you think is driving the recent improvement?

Marvin Ellison
President, CEO & Chairman

So Zack, thanks for the question. Just to hit it at a high level, our small to medium Pro business remains very stable. And roughly 75% of our Pro's are very confident in their job prospects. And also, this segment of the Pro consumer continues to work on smaller ticket repair and maintenance projects, and that's been very consistent with what we've been saying all year long. So when we look at our Pro's, when we talk to our Pro's, they feel very confident in their business. They feel confident in their access to credit and even feel a little more confident about their ability to hire and attract labor. So we feel great about what our pros are telling us.

And let me hand it over to Joe to just talk about some of the things we're doing in the store to drive this continued growth and, in my opinion, market share gain with the specific customer segment.

Joseph McFarland
Executive Vice President of Stores

Well, thanks for the question. And we're really pleased with the flywheel effect that we're seeing from the transform Pro offering. And when you think about where we've been headed with the loyalty through MyLowe's Pro Rewards, a relaunch there, we have just a wonderful enhanced digital experience that Pro extended aisle we have made investments in fulfillment. The last 3 years, our Pro inventory investments are really beginning to pay off. The order modifications of fulfillment flexibility in the in-store experience. So we're excited to see this flywheel effect all come together with the great product offerings that we have. And we have a good confidence that when this does bounce back, we're well positioned to capture the share.

Marvin Ellison
President, CEO & Chairman

And Zack, the only thing I'll add to that, I mentioned in my prepared comments that we're in the process of adding FBM to our Pro extended aisle platform. That's going to be a huge deal for us because it is very challenging for us today to fulfill a large order of something, let's say, drywall to a customer job site and do it efficiently. We now are working to just transition that entire fulfillment process to a company that's best-in-class at it, and that's FBM. And so we think this is going to be great for FBM. It's going to be great for Lowe's, but more importantly, it's going to be great for the customer. So again, we see this as a sustainable growth strategy, and we feel great about the work we've done thus far.

Zachary Fadem
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Appreciate that. And I know we aren't guiding for '26 yet, but since the model is different with FBM and ADG, could we talk through early margin scenarios in both a status quo environment as well as the scenario where perhaps we see some benefits from tax stimulus and low rates?

Brandon Sink
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Zack, I'll just hit briefly what we're looking at in terms of margins on the FBM and ADG transactions. When you look at 2025 taken in isolation, I mentioned in my remarks, we're roughly 20 basis points on 2025. So that's coming roughly split even 10 from FBM and 10 ADG. And then when you look at as we wrap the year for 2026. That's going to be 50 basis points on the year. So I think 30 basis points of wrap into 2026.

And the majority of that 50 basis points when you think of 2026 is going to be weighted towards gross margin on that. So I'm not going to get into any more details as it relates to base business or run rate, but that's just some early views of geography and impact from the transactions in '26.

Our next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.

Simeon Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I wanted to ask to put the macro hat on again, there's a -- I don't know if it's a bear case, but there's a housing scenario that it just stayed in this -- it's treading water position for a longer. You have new prices that are lower than existing homes and the age of homeowners is pushing close to 40 years old. So I think affordability is the issue. It sounds like you may reject that premise, Marvin, given some of the bright spots, but I wanted to hear how you react to it.

Marvin Ellison
President, CEO & Chairman

No, Simeon, it's a good question. So I'll give you my thoughts, and I'll let Brandon provide any additional comments. The way we see it is this. I think that mortgage rates obviously are elevated longer than any of us anticipated. But the one thing that's different, as I said in my prepared comments is the fact that you have a healthy homeowner financially, and you have $33 trillion in equity that is in the system. And we think where between $11 billion to $13 billion, $1 trillion of that is capable. So we think this lock-in effect is real because at some point, customers are going to be looking at these sub-3% 30-year fixed mortgage rates.

They like the neighborhood that they live in. They have excess equity in their home, and we think HELOCs are going to become the next opportunity for us to drive discretionary remodel big-ticket projects. So we think that is a strong possibility in the future. Now we're not going to try to time it. We're not going to try to build it in our forecast. I think that would be reckless. But we do think that, that is a very plausible hypothesis that takes you away from the bear case.

So I'll pass it on to Brandon to see if he has any other thoughts.

Brandon Sink
Executive VP & CFO

Simeon, I'll add, as Marvin mentioned, the mortgage rates, we're looking at those remaining elevated at least as of now 6% to 6.5% tied more to the longer-term yields, and that's continuing to pressure both existing home sales and new home starts. And I think as we start to look ahead into 2026, we're not anticipating meaningful near-term improvement there.

But we are potentially excited about what could happen with the funding coming from home equity. We've seen 150 basis points of rate cuts from the Fed here over the last 18 months, the consensus would suggest we're going to see more -- we've seen these HELOC rates go from neighborhood of 10% to 12% down to 8% to 10%. And that's creating, I think, some opportunity as we look at project backlog, when we look at the data about $50 billion of projects that have been delayed or deferred with the equity now with the potential to be a significant funding mechanism.

And if we do see further near-term rate reductions that could act ongoing as an additional stimulus. So we're investing in the business through our Total Home Strategy to be prepared for that type of environment and excited about the potential upside related to that into 2026.

Simeon Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And my follow-up, it's on the medium-to-larger Pro. Can you, Marvin, set up what Lowe's strategy is there. We've talked about the pieces of it. Will you keep supply chain separate? Are there categories that you think are essential to addressing that customer, whether it's an existing home remodel or even a new homebuilder and will you cross-sell that customer using the rest of the Lowe's asset base?

Marvin Ellison
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. So Simeon, I would say we feel great about the current strategy with the smaller medium Pro is working. We've had quarter-over-quarter growth. We think it hinges on our MyLowe's Pro Rewards loyalty platform. It's resonating well where our customers we think it hinges well on the products that Bill's team brings to the table every day, and that was a huge gap in deficit for us 7 years ago, and that is no longer the case. We also think it's important that we maintain a very competitive credit portfolio. We have a best-in-class, 5% off every day for our Lowe's credit cardholders, and that also extends to the Pro customer that resonates exceptionally well.

And we have every intention on leveraging FBM for fulfillment in every intention on taking the roughly 40 million FBM Pro customers and getting them connected to complementary projects, product and projects at Lowe's. But we see a very specific void in the marketplace for serving the small-to-medium Pro. That's why we've been so intentional about focusing on that customer. And we think we can focus on that customer in the brick-and-mortar stores and Lowes.com. And we can have a very robust strategy and platform with FBM and ADG and we can do both concurrently.

One of the reasons we talk about the importance of FBM's commercial business is because it's countercyclical. When housing is down, that commercial business tends to outperform, and that's what we're seeing right now. So overall, we think we can do both and the data has proven that we have a very effective strategy with the small-and-medium Pro.

Our next question is from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.

Katharine McShane
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

We wanted to ask a little bit more about the marketplace, just in terms of like what the initial performance has been, what you've seen with regards to seller onboarding product expansion and customer adoption? And just when you expect to scale this platform to a point where it could start to contribute more meaningfully to margin?

Marvin Ellison
President, CEO & Chairman

No. Kate, thank you for the question. We are really excited about the launch of our marketplace. The caveat is it's really early. And so we're not going to get into a lot of conversation relative to performance other than to say if exceeding expectations relative to financial performance, exceeding expectations, relative to the number of sellers and the quality of sellers. So every seller that we've approached and we are literally looking at 4-star plus rated sellers are required to get on this platform. And we again had great adoption with [indiscernible] technology, and they actually awarded Lowe's as the fastest launch partner they've ever had.

So we were able to get that done quickly and we feel incredibly excited. And one of the unique characteristics that we have is at virtually everything purchase as a marketplace item can be returned in a physical Lowe's store because Joe his team partnered with technology some years back to create the technology rails to make that happen. So it creates incredible convenience for the customer when they need to return something. And again, I'll let Bill talk about how the merchants are playing a role to make sure that we have a really balanced approach to how we're thinking about this.

William Boltz
Executive Vice President of Merchandising

Thanks, Marvin. And Kate, the only thing I would add is, obviously, early, but we're learning a lot as we progress with marketplace. We're finding that it's an opportunity to expand programs that our current vendors are providing in our stores to provide stuff that would be found on Lowes.com. And we're also entering and finding new products, products that quite honestly, we didn't think that could be available on Lowes.com that now is available and the consumers are engaging and buying them.

So we're excited about that learning and what that can do. But at the forefront of when we put this together based on being a closed system, is that we wanted it to complement what we were doing with what's happening inside of our stores, and that's exactly what we're seeing early on here.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays.

Seth Sigman
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I wanted to ask about operating leverage going forward. You've been delivering really strong operating margin improvement this year on pretty low comps. I guess it's been mostly driven by gross margin this year. So how do you think about the sustainability of gross margin as the primary driver of that? Or does the composition of margin expansion change over time? And then I guess, in general, if you could speak to how you are thinking about the leverage point in the business? That would be helpful.

Brandon Sink
Executive VP & CFO

Sure, Seth. This is Brandon. Thanks for the question. I think as it relates to margin, very focused at this point on delivering that the 12.1% operating margin that we communicated as part of our guide. And just as a reminder ex, the dilution from the acquisitions, that's at 12.3% consistent with the flat bottom end of our range that we communicated at the beginning of the year. So the team has done a really great job balancing flow-through, the balance between gross margin, SG&A, managing the tariff pressure that we've been dealing with.

And honestly, the PPI initiatives continuing to deliver $1 billion split roughly between SG&A and gross margin, that has been the primary driver in our ability to deliver amid softer sales. I think as we look ahead into 2026, a few things I would highlight we're continuing to look at FBM and ADG what we think housing and commercial markets are going to be looking like in the business performance there in '26. I mentioned earlier, new home starts both single-family and multifamily remain under pressure, but confident with these businesses that we can gain share in a down market.

Marvin also mentioned a nice balance that we have on the commercial side. So looking at that and how that impacts the margin profile into '26. And then the last thing I'll mention, just as we continue to look at tariffs, those ramp here in Q3, we're expecting that also to continue ramping in Q4 and the wrap to affect the first half of the year. So managing through that and trying to understand how that impacts both sales margin and operating margin going forward. So all that will be waived. We'll look at that in terms of our previous rule of thumb, and we'll have more on that as we get into our call in February for 2026.

Simeon Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And then just I guess a related follow-up would be on the gross margin specifically. The gains this quarter really stepped up. Can you just unpack that a little bit more? Are there any timing consideration? I mean you mentioned tariffs starting to flow through, was there a benefit from raising prices relative to the cost coming through? Or anything else you can tell us about the mix dynamics that seem to be supportive this quarter?

Brandon Sink
Executive VP & CFO

I would say, Seth, on Q3 margin, really nothing related to pricing or tariffs. I would say there, that's playing out very much in line with our expectations just in terms of estimating when the cost is going to be flowing through margin. The great work that Bill and team have done on the merchandising side with our suppliers. It really is the themes that I outlined in my remarks. We're lapping storm pressure from last year. So that is serving as a benefit this year. The credit portfolio has outperformed our expectations on better-than-expected losses. And then Bill referenced the SKU rationalization initiative. We've seen really good sell-through results thus far on the inventory that we're exiting there. That really was the core of the composition of the 50 basis points that we saw in Q3.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.

Gregory Melich
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I'd love to follow up on the traffic and ticket breakdown. If you look at the ticket expansion, it's accelerated like each quarter this year, how much of that 150 bps of acceleration is related to some of the early tariffs going through? How much of it is mix? And how sort of the basket evolving in terms of items in it and the size?

Brandon Sink
Executive VP & CFO

Greg, I can speak to ticket and transaction. So when we look at ticket growth, it's really similar when we look at Q3 performance as to what we've seen in previous quarters in terms of the drivers. So the strength in our Pro business, also appliances, I will reference that in Q3, we did have some modest price increases. When we look at like-for-like inflation, again, modest. It's very consistent with our expectations and also the year-to-date trends that we've seen as we continue to watch tariffs move through the system. The offset is transactions, and that has been pressured by the lower DIY demand, but I'll also call out the bulk of the 100 basis points of storm-related pressure with the DIY is affecting the transaction.

So that's really the driver of the offset when we look at Q3. And then I think when we look ahead to Q4, a lot of those same drivers are expected lift from Pro appliances. There will be some modest like-for-like inflation. Just as a reminder, we also have 100 basis points of hurricane pressure that we're cycling in Q4 that will also pressure comps and pressure DIY transactions in Q4.

Gregory Melich
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And then maybe just a clarification on before. The 50 bps is the full annualized effect on the margins of the 2 acquisitions, right? So we have like basically 15 bps that show up this year and then 35 bps next year.

Brandon Sink
Executive VP & CFO

So yes, I would -- Greg, it's 20 on the year for 2025 and then 30 of wrap for a total annualized run rate into 2026 of 50 basis points.

Gregory Melich
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And if I take the guide for 4Q, it seems like margins should be down around 60 bps, and it's fair to say it's the 2 of those sort of rolling in.

Brandon Sink
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I would say when you isolate Q4, the bulk of the operating margin decrease is going to be driven by layering in the transactions. We have $1.3 billion of sales for FBM that will pressure operating margin or dilute it down as well as ADG. So that's driving the bulk of the change in Q4.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of Zhihan Ma with Bernstein.

Zhihan Ma
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

I wanted to ask about the FBM, ADG integration that you're doing. Can you just help us understand to what extent you're maybe onboarding ADG onto FBM ERP system, how does that integration work in the near term?

Marvin Ellison
President, CEO & Chairman

Thank you for the question. It's early days. So the first rule that we have is to do no harm to the performance of either business platform, including Lowe's. But we are in the early stages of the integration. The big advantage we have is FBM's current IT platform is the same platform that we are transitioning ADG too. That is not by accident. And also, it's an existing platform that we have in our Lowe's Pro Supply businesses.

So we feel like we're going to have the ability to accelerate the IT integration between the companies, but as you can respect, we're in the early stages of that, but we feel really good about the plan. We feel really good about the timetable, and we have the best IT team in retail working on it. So I'm very confident we'll be able to make it happen.

Zhihan Ma
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Great. And then just a longer-term follow-up. You mentioned the plan to delever to the 2.75 by mI'd-'27. Is the longer-term plan to resume share buybacks by then? Or should we expect additional acquisitions from here?

Brandon Sink
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I would say, Zhihan, still very focused on the integration activities. As Marvin mentioned, that's going to be our focus here over the next 2 years. We're pausing share repo and very much expect to get back down to that 2.75x leverage target by 2027. So that's our focus. FBM is going to continue to run their existing play in the meantime, expanding through greenfield expansion, organic growth. And there could be potentially some small tuck-in M&A, but that would only be what we could self-fund with additional cash flow. So I think that's the best way to think about how we're going to be operating here over the next 2 years.

Operator

Our last question comes from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America.

Robert Ohmes
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just 2 follow-ups. Just on the fourth quarter when you -- the way you're planning it for seasonal and given a little bit more probably tariff prices coming through. Any changes in the timing of promos? Are you doing any promos earlier related to holiday and things like that?

William Boltz
Executive Vice President of Merchandising

No, Robby. I mean the promotional cadence remains relatively consistent to prior years. We started the quarter off with kind of the early pre-Black Friday type stuff that we've been doing. Obviously, Black Friday next week. And then post Black Friday, when you get into Cyber Monday events for dot-com and then you get into that leading up to the holiday time frame. We've got offers out there for both the MyLowe's Rewards members as well as our -- all of our consumers, both online and in-store, so relatively consistent...

Robert Ohmes
BofA Securities, Research Division

And then just a follow-up. On flooring and the strength you guys are seeing there, you guys called out soft surfaces. Is there a trade down going on? How do you think you're doing relative to industry? Is there something changing in flooring? Or is it all -- is it something about your positioning in good, better, best? Or maybe a little more color there.

William Boltz
Executive Vice President of Merchandising

Yes. It's nice to be able to give a shout out to the flooring team and all the work that they've been doing. Last quarter, we announced the acquisition and being able to get Daltile into our assortment. So that's starting to roll in now. But specifically, the soft surface, it's really the strength of STAINMASTER and we've called that out as one of our strongest brands, and now we've got LeakDefense being able to be offered. So that is not a trade down, that's a trade-up offering in the assortment.

But I think the team has done a really nice job of offering value out there every single day. And I'd stack our soft surface offer out there every single day against what's going on in the marketplace. And then you could go into luxury vinyl, you can go into resilient hybrid and then you go into hard surface tile and the teams have offers out there every single day to close that consumer that's now making the decision to do a flooring project.

Joseph McFarland
Executive Vice President of Stores

Robby, I would just add that the investments we've continued to make in our services business, flooring was one of our first to go central selling, where we remove that complexity of the design from the store. We shortened the time to close the customer and take them off the market. And so I think all in all the products the service level, we're really seeing some green shoots.

Kate Pearlman
