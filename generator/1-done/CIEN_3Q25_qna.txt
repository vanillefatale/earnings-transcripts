Question-and-Answer Session


Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from George Notter from Wolfe Research.


George Notter
Wolfe Research, LLC

I guess I wanted to start by just asking some questions about sort of the industry structure and how you see that impacting your gross margin over time. Obviously, we've seen Infinera get consumed by Nokia. They're putting those 2 businesses together. A lot of the small or subscale guys in the industry have fallen by the wayside, I think, to some degree. So it seems like the market environment should be much better for you guys. How do you think about that as it relates to gross margin going forward? And do you see some opportunities to be more firm on price or even raise price as the market kind of coalesces around 2 vendors or even just Ciena? Any thought there?


Gary Smith
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, George. Listen, I think, as you know, we've invested very strongly in the high-speed connectivity, and we clearly have an 18 months to 24-month lead on that. So I think that's highly valued by the cloud providers and hyperscalers and service providers as well. So I think we have a very strong competitive advantage there. And I think the structure of the industry has improved considerably over the last few years. And that does play through to our expectation. It's a confluence of elements around our improving gross margin.

I'll let Marc talk to some of the other elements there. But basically, that's part of the economics that we believe we can get over time into the mid-40s gross margin. As Marc said, we called really Q2 as the bottom for that, and we expect to see steadily improving gross margins quarterly over time.


Marc Graff
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, George, this is Marc. What I would add to what Gary said is we're really trying to take a pretty structured approach to how we think about gross margins, and we think about those really in 3 buckets. The first bucket is how do we design products that have a long life with continuing reducing cost structures. The second is optimizing how we work with our supply chain and our suppliers to really make sure that we're realizing and accelerating those unit costs on those items that we procure. And then the third piece is really making sure that we're having the conversations, which we are real time with some of our customers to ensure a fair value exchange.

As we think about the current construct, we're really excited about expanding our footprint. And given the long life of these products, we think that sets us up really well for gross margin expansion as they continue to invest in their networks.


George Notter
Wolfe Research, LLC

Got it. In terms of value exchange, I assume you're talking about the potential for raising price or being firmer on price. Is that an option for you guys?


Gary Smith
CEO, President & Director

I think the expression value exchange is a much nicer expression, George. Yes. Yes.

Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan.


Samik Chatterjee
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats on the strong outlook here. Maybe just to start with the neo-scaler opportunity and sort of how you're thinking about how that evolves more in terms of sizing and timing as well? And how should we think about that contributing to your updated guide for fiscal '26? What are the sort of range of engagements you have on that front? And I have a follow-up as well.


Gary Smith
CEO, President & Director

Samik, listen, I think it's a net incremental opportunity for us that's going to scale over time. We're encouraged by what we're seeing at the early stages of that. A lot of these neo-scalers are identifying fairly early on that they want to invest in the network. They understand the issues around connectivity and how they're going to enable their business. So you're seeing a lot of new builds beginning with these neo-scalers, and we've won a number of them, and we have a number in our pipeline. So I think as we go through '26, we've included that, obviously, in our guide, what our expectations are for these. But I think they will increasingly, over the next few years, play a more significant role in our overall growth.


Samik Chatterjee
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Got it. And maybe for my follow-up, staying on this sort of guidance for about 17% growth similar to fiscal '25. How should I think about the composition if it's at all different compared to fiscal '25 because between telcos, MOFNs, cloud companies and then you have the incremental opportunities around NeoCloud and the component revenues that you've also talked about. Is there sort of a way to think about how maybe the composition of the growth is different from fiscal '25, even though the growth rate is pretty similar?


Gary Smith
CEO, President & Director

I think increasingly, obviously, it's driven by AI workloads. But I would also say that we expect service providers to play an increasing role in that, both delivering hybrid networks to the cloud players and also in these managed optical fiber networks. We're seeing multiple opportunities, both in North America and internationally in MOFN. So roughly right now, directly -- hyperscalers in their various forms, including neo-scalers is roughly about 50% of our business. Our kind of view is I expect that to be similar actually in '26. But a large part of that service provider workload will be MOFN and cloud and AI Edge related. So I think it's going to be a confluence of platforms that deliver those workloads.


Marc Graff
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I would just -- Samik, it's Marc. I would just add that we've got reasonably good visibility into that given the huge backlog that we have today and what we expect to leave Q4 with. So I would agree with what Gary is saying.


Operator

And our next question comes from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley.


Meta Marshall
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. Congrats on the great quarter. Just wanted to get a sense of -- you guys have been making efforts to increase utilization on some of the pluggable platforms and just kind of getting increased utilization out of that. Just wondered how much of the gross margin upside kind of came from mix relative to kind of initiatives on your own part? And then just if you could kind of identify on gross margins, just what was the upside from tariffs versus expectations?


Marc Graff
Senior VP & CFO

Yet, it's Marc. Let me take that, and then I'll let Scott and Gary add some color. In terms of the gross margin uptick that we're looking at, as we scale those parts, we're expecting, obviously, those unit costs to come down. And that really out the way we expected in Q3.

As we look forward to the 42% to 43% guide that we gave and then the 43% plus or minus guide that we gave for '26, we expect those trends to continue. And so we should be seeing some tailwinds from improving ramps of those products as they get cost reduced just through scale.

The second part of your question around the goodness that we saw in Q3 from tariffs. We told you last quarter that we expected to be about $10 million roughly in tariff costs per quarter. As we saw the administration kind of work out some of the trade deals with various nations that impact us like India or Vietnam, et cetera, we're able to tighten up some of those expectations. So we saw a little bit of good news, maybe it's 20 or 30 basis points of the benefit that we got out of the $90 million that I cited. And that's really -- yes, that's really what was driving it. It was just getting tighter on the uncertain environment.


Scott McFeely
Executive Advisor

And Meta, just to follow up on your margin question. You referred to headwinds that we referenced in previous calls around some of our new product introduction, whether it be pluggables or 6e or RLS. And Marc gave you the dimensions of what the margin changes were quarter-over-quarter. But I would say we did that margin improvement despite the fact that we were shipping a lot more RLS and a lot more plugs. And to give you a sample of that quarter-over-quarter on the plug business, that ports that we shipped were about 20% sequentially. So we were able to deliver margin improvement even in the face of that. And RLS had another bumper quarter. And that's all coming from scale in general matters, the natural life cycle of these new introduction products and our continuous focus on cost reduction over time.

And then as we look forward into '26, we will be able to take advantage of a technology transition into our WaveLogic 6 family as well, which will yield better margins for us.


Operator

And our next question comes from Ruben Roy from Stifel.


Ruben Roy
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

A question for Gary or Scott. I wanted to dig in a little more to scale across. You obviously talked about the GPU clusters last quarter, Gary. But this term scale across is popping up more and with NVIDIA talking about a dedicated switch for scale across. I wonder if you could talk through the opportunity relative to coherent light and sort of your broader portfolio because it seems like you've been talking about coherent light for a while now, maybe almost a year, but it seems like there's a bigger opportunity across these dedicated areas of infrastructure that are being discussed with this concept of scale across. Am I thinking about that right?


Scott McFeely
Executive Advisor

Yes. Ruben, you're absolutely correct. The scale across network, as you say, is sort of connecting GPUs at distance beyond a single data center. The actual specific example that we referenced in terms of the first customer movement on that, at a high level, you would have thought that may have been an opportunity for coherent light, but what we actually see is more and more often, these cloud providers are needing to bring the network to the power and where they can get the power is dictating the distances and the performance requirements. In order for you to be a leader to service that demand, you need to have a breadth of capabilities. Coherent light will be an important one of those on the menu.

But this particular example, we had to actually use our performance optics. So it's 800-gig 6 Nano because of the distance they were pushing. But for sure, coherent light still believe in the opportunity. It is not if it's a question in. And the view we put out in the past was that we would expect to see revenue start to flow on those technologies in '27. I don't think our perspective has changed on that.


Ruben Roy
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Got it. And then just a quick follow-up on the residential broadband. I might have missed this. But in terms of -- I think you said you're going to continue to support the business. It sounds like there's a little bit of PON activity going on again, and we've got some [indiscernible] related stuff happening here in North America. Is that something that you folks might be looking to potentially divest or just no more investment and just kind of run rate that out over however long the time period is that, that takes?


Gary Smith
CEO, President & Director

I think, Ruben, it's more the latter approach. And I think if you think about the growth opportunities that we've got, across the board on AI workloads, we really want to prioritize those. So we're going to continue to support our broadband initiatives there. We are just really not going to put the longer-term road map for that in place, which we were investing in. And I think given our priorities, it makes absolute sense to put it front and center behind the optical portfolio.


Scott McFeely
Executive Advisor

Yes. And Ruben, specifically, when we say defocus or prioritize the future investment, what we're talking about here is the higher capacity PON technologies, 25-gig and 100-gig PON. PON is still an important technology for us in terms of offering an access choice on our routing and switching portfolio and a key contributor to optics inside the data center with our DCOM solution set.


Operator

Our next question comes from Simon Leopold from Raymond James.


Simon Leopold
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

The first thing I wanted to ask about is maybe a little bit of kind of compare and contrast of this DCI opportunity because clearly, Ciena has been interconnecting data centers for years. But in this use case, you're talking about hundreds of millions to interconnect a pair of data centers. And so what I'm trying to get a better sense of here is sort of the distinct differences and then what is sort of that market opportunity from here?

And then just -- I'll give you my follow-up as well, which is the routing and switching business outperformed expectations this quarter. And when we pair this with the reduced focus on residential broadband, it would imply that there's some other aspect driving it. And I'd like to see if you could unpack is this more about the service provider activity in routing? Or is the strength this telemetry opportunity that Gary mentioned earlier in the call?


Gary Smith
CEO, President & Director

Simon, let me take the first part of that, and Scott will take the second part of the question. I think what's different around this data DCI connectivity we're seeing, it's shorter distance and it's a dedicated training network, if you were to put it simply.

So it's super high speed, low latency. That's why it's using our RLS and the 800-gig plugs at scale. This is just one region of this particular hyperscaler. We believe that there are other applications that will -- this same application will roll out both at this hyperscale and at others. It's the first one of its kind that we're aware of, and we're beginning to roll that out now, but it's dedicated for training across multiple GPU clusters.


Scott McFeely
Executive Advisor

And on the routing and switching question, Simon, I think there's 2 dynamics here. One, for sure, it has mirrored sort of the comeback in terms of service provider spending. As you know, it was largely exposed to the service provider space in terms of the opportunity set. So that's one key driver.

The second one, though, is we are seeing an emergence of coherent routing opportunities. This is playing to the strength of our optics inside our routers, and you start to see that in service provider aggregation networks. And then the third one, you mentioned it, which is the opportunity to take that routing portfolio and the technologies that we have and create this optics inside the data center for their communication networks, so the DCOM as we call it, opportunity. So those are the 3 drivers, and they're all contributing.


Operator

Our next question comes from Tim Long from Barclays.


Timothy Long
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Yes, two for me as well. First, if you could just touch on the kind of interconnect pluggable business with a double this year and double or more next year as well. Just talk a little bit about kind of the breadth of customer base currently in that interconnect pluggable business. And to get to that level of doubling again next year, does that imply you need some incremental wins there or not? That's number one.

And number two, back to that win, Gary, that you were just talking about. If you could just touch on. It sounded like hundreds of millions, maybe discuss a little bit the ramp of what you have in that one region, like kind of what's in hand right now? And any margin implications that we would expect as that deal gets up to full run rate?


Scott McFeely
Executive Advisor

Yes. Let me tackle the first one on the interconnect business. Just a reminder for folks on the call, when we talk about interconnects, it's really the categorization of selling high-speed optical technologies either as plugs or subcomponents independent of our system business. So that's what embodies the interconnect business. As I said earlier, we had our best quarter ever in terms of plug shipments. They're up 20% sequentially and up something like 140% year-on-year, which puts us well on track to beat or exceed our stated goal of doubling that piece of the business from '24 to '25.

We are shipping revenue against our 6n, which is the next technology platform, both in terms of complete plugs, but also subcomponents of that as DSPs and our electro-optics sold as component unbundled from our plugs, and that's just starting. I would say the number of customers here measures in the 10s, multiple 10s. And the confidence that we have to say we are capable of doubling it year-over-year actually is in our order book. We have a fantastic backlog and order book here. We got great visibility into next year.


Gary Smith
CEO, President & Director

The second part of your question around the application I talked about with the dedicated training network. It is multiple hundreds of millions. It is a considerable amount of RLS, which is pretty much the de facto standard now amongst all of the hyperscalers, our line system. We're laying a massive amount of tracks around the globe. This is another example of it. We have the orders for this first region in-house, and we are beginning to deliver in Q4, recognize some revenues in Q4, but fairly small. But it will ramp up in Q1 and Q2 of next year. And that is really just one region. And it's the first time that we've seen this application. And this obviously is a new application for connecting data centers. And it really represents, we think, over time, a pretty expansive TAM opportunity for us.

And obviously, we're super well placed for both our line system, our modem technology and in fact, our domain manager, they're all industry-leading. And you put those things together, and it really is the sort of de facto standard for this kind of high-speed, low-latency application.


Marc Graff
Senior VP & CFO

Tim, this is Marc. You had a question about the impacts on the margin. The 43% that plus or minus that we gave you for 2026 is inclusive of what we have in place today. As we continue to ramp that, one of the benefits that we see of these large orders is it gets us to scale faster. And so that will be a tailwind for us as we continue to ramp those solutions.


Operator

Our next question comes from Tim Savageaux from Northland Capital Markets.


Timothy Savageaux
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

My first question is on WaveLogic 6. Can you give us any color or details in terms of customer additions in the quarter and where you are from a total customer count or revenue impact or any kind of details you might be able to add there?


Scott McFeely
Executive Advisor

Thanks, Tim. I assume you're talking about WaveLogic 6 Extreme. If that's not right, you can jump in and correct me. But we had great success with 6e in early days. We added 11 new customers last quarter. We're up to a total of 60 customers. The port shipments on 6e doubled last quarter, quarter-over-quarter sequentially. So we're in a significant ramp phase. We are either standardized or in the process of standardizing across all the major hyperscale cloud providers. And from a generation perspective, it's a bit of a subjective statement, but I believe it's sort of our fastest ramp on any of our generations on coherent technologies.


Timothy Savageaux
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

And my follow-up is on the supply side. It doesn't really seem to be impacting you, but I wonder if you could comment on the overall component or supply constraint situation?


Gary Smith
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Tim, I would say that we've invested significantly across the supply chain ecosystem, and we continue to do so. That's really what has enabled us to grow 30% year-on-year by quarter comparison. That's a result of that 17% midpoint of the guide for the year. So you can see we've scaled that up. We have made considerable investments to continue that scaling up in 2026, given the opportunity. And the sort of -- as Marc indicated, we expect similar kind of growth rates next year.

Obviously, the scale of the business we're at, you can imagine that requires considerable investment, which we've already made. So we believe that whilst we're constrained, our revenues would be higher if we've had bigger capacity, but we are ramping that up in alignment with what we see the market opportunity to be. So we still have challenges in certain components as you ramp up this kind of scale, but we're working our way through them, and we believe that the things that we put in place across our global supply chain will put us in a very good position to, over time, potentially, as we get through '26, reduce some of our lead times as that capacity comes online.


Operator

Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore.


Amit Daryanani
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I have two as well. I guess maybe to start with, Gary, given the comments you just have been making on the strength of your backlog and order momentum, is it fair to think that your cloud revenue should actually accelerate in fiscal '26 versus '25? And if that's fair, then does that sort of imply that the rest of the business is going to decelerate next year? Or is that more a reflection of it's fairly early in the year, and we're trying to be a bit more conservative versus [indiscernible]?


Gary Smith
CEO, President & Director

No. Amit, I think there's a big change going on. And it's not just -- obviously, you're layering on. Service provider is continuing to have very good sustainable growth. If you think about the service provider market, it's really underinvested in core optical infrastructure over the last 5 years, a, because of all the COVID, supply chain absorption and all the rest of it; and b, the preoccupation with 5G. They're now, I think, well over that. And we're seeing, I think, a good runway for just service provider growth. It's at a lower growth rate. It's in the mid-single digits, but it's super helpful. It's half of our business. So we have pretty good line of sight to that.

I would also say that 3 out of the top 5 customers this quarter were service providers. And I also think the other dynamic around this shift of workloads, as you start getting these AI workloads closer to the edge, you're really talking service providers. And that, in addition to the MOFN opportunities, which we're seeing both in North America and globally, continue to expand. I think service providers are going to play a critical role in this whole AI workload delivery. So I would expect, even though we're going to have outsized relative to service provider growth in cloud, I think the mix is going to be fairly similar in terms of direct next year. So they're both growing. Hyperscale is obviously at a higher rate given the global scale of the investment necessary for the data center interconnect.


Amit Daryanani
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. Super helpful. And then when I start to listen, you talked about some of the big wins you've had on the AI side, especially the out-of-band networking management and the scale across win. It almost sounds like you're starting to co-develop and co-design some of these solutions with your customers. Is that fair? And if that's the case, then should we think about Ciena having perhaps better market share than what you've historically had going forward in this cloud opportunity?


Gary Smith
CEO, President & Director

I think that's a very fair observation. If you look at RLS. RLS was actually also a collaboration with hyperscalers in terms of the design to it. And we're actually leaning into them across a number of technologies where we're co-creating the technology and the evolution of both the line system and the modem technology as well. So you look at the kind of growth rates we're having here. And I think over time, one can only conclude that we're going to continue to expand our market share in this space.


Operator

And our next question comes from David Vogt from UBS.


David Vogt
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I have two as well and my line cut out so if you answered this, I apologize. Gary, can you help frame or mark the sort of contribution from the new DCOM opportunity maybe in the quarter and kind of how we should think about that in terms of scale relative to the broader broadly defined networking space out there?

And then the second question is, I appreciate the early look into fiscal '26. Just trying to get a sense for how much of your confidence comes from where your backlog sits today, given how strong orders have been and how that converts into revenue? Or sort of an explanation is that maybe you think the continued growth in orders in 3Q and 4Q translates into continued strength in fiscal '26 as well? Like how much is coming from sustained order growth versus some of it coming from backlog rev rec at this point?


Gary Smith
CEO, President & Director

David. On the DCOM side, this is one customer that we've co-created with. We think -- well, we know that this application can be generic to data center technology given that it plays nicely to reducing power and space, which is critical. I would say just with this one customer, it is hundreds of millions. And we've got the first initial orders for that, and we will begin deployments shortly. But that's continuing to ramp. So it is hundreds of millions, and that's just one customer.


Marc Graff
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And so again, as you think about the impact to the margins, David, as that thing ramps, again, we get the scale benefit and that scale benefit kind of ripples through the entirety of the P&L. And so like Gary said, we're starting to ramp that now. This particular customer is one of our largest customers for this quarter. This particular workload DCOM is starting to ramp within that customer's envelope. And so we expect to get some tailwinds from that from a margin perspective as it ramps through Q4 and then obviously to hundreds of millions, as Gary talked about in 2026.


David Vogt
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And then overall fiscal '26 kind of color, if you can share? How much of your confidence comes from your elevated backlog and strength in orders versus kind of sustained demand going into next year?


Marc Graff
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So it's really around the backlog that we're seeing this year, right? So as we talked about in the previous question, if we had more supply, we're able to get more revenue. As that supply kind of goes into 2026, those orders are going to get fulfilled in '26, and we'll recognize that revenue then. So as we talked about the visibility into the second half of 2026, we've got fairly high confidence that the guide that we gave you is going to be achievable.

As Gary mentioned earlier, we're also seeing some pretty healthy growth as witnessed again by orders from our service providers. And so the combination of those 2 things from both our cloud side of the customer house and the service provider customer house is giving us quite a bit of confidence as we go into 2026, which is why we decided to give you the 2026 guidance a quarter earlier than we normally would. I'm not sure we'll do that again. But given the confidence that we had and the momentum that we're leaving this year with, we felt pretty comfortable giving you guys a sneak peek on what 2026 would look like.


Gary Smith
CEO, President & Director

The other point I would make is, as you look out longer term here to the durability to it, first of all, you're looking at massive scale of investment that's going to be necessary. So I think we all take comfort from that. Secondly, you've got a lot of these new applications, some of which we've talked about today. But we also -- none of this sort of guide that we've given you includes really inside the data center coherent adoption, which we think that intersection as you move from electrons to photons, as you require less latency and higher speed is going to happen. It's just a matter of when. And so that's all in front of us. So not just for '26, but beyond, I think we have a very good high confidence in the dynamics that we're seeing. There's a secular shift in our opportunity.


Operator

Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman from BNP Paribas.


Karl Ackerman
BNP Paribas Exane, Research Division

Yes. Given the doubling of the module business next year, your growing backlog, higher-margin blades and now these 2 hyperscale industry-first wins that underscore your opportunity to partner with hyperscalers and perhaps GPU vendors earlier in the cycle as well as your prudent investment in broadband, I guess why can't operating margins attain your long-term goal of 15% next year?


Marc Graff
Senior VP & CFO

They are. So sorry, maybe I wasn't super clear. So one of the things that we're looking at is a pretty significant increase in operating leverage as we go from one 17% year to the next 17% growth year, while we're keeping OpEx flat. And so what I mentioned in the prepared remarks was we are pulling in the 2027 15% to 16% op margin goal into 2026, right? So I want to be super clear, it's a 1-year acceleration and our expectation is we hit 15% to 16% in fiscal 2026. Does that help, Karl?


Karl Ackerman
BNP Paribas Exane, Research Division

That does. That does, yes. And then if you -- just a quick follow-up. You spoke a lot about the revenue opportunity you see in fiscal '26, but can you talk about whether your order visibility extends into fiscal '27 with these cloud providers that you spoke about today?


Gary Smith
CEO, President & Director

Karl, I think I addressed some of that in terms of the other opportunities that we're seeing that layer on basically in addition to what we're already seeing. Obviously, it's a little early to talk about '27. It's a little early to talk about '26, but we have good visibility into it. So we're giving those. Listen, I think this is a very durable multiyear secular shift in the demand environment. And when you think about it, so much investment has gone into AI in its various forms. The GPU accelerators, LLMs, data centers and all infrastructure about that.

Now it's time for the network because without the network, it's got to come out of the data center to enable all of this stuff to happen. Monetization, training, inference, all of those things need the network. And there's a greater prioritization right now in terms of driving the growth of that network so you don't strand these assets and you really enable the whole AI infrastructure. And we're at the very early innings of that.


Gregg Lampf
Vice President of Investor Relations

We have time for one more question.


Operator

And our next question comes from Ryan Koontz from Needham.


Ryan Koontz
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

I want to circle back to your comments on vertical integration and supply chain and really at the optical layer here. Can you maybe expand on where you are there relative to your own supply versus commercial components and how you've been able to navigate the tight supply situation out there?


Scott McFeely
Executive Advisor

Ryan, I'd say this, if I look at the optical modem piece, which is a big, big part of our portfolio, we are in terms of capability, I believe, the most vertically integrated supplier in the industry. And that's not to say that we depend only 100% on our own components because from a strategic perspective, we use our own components, and we also use third-party component providers to provide us flexibility. And in a constrained environment like we are now, we're using all those levers.


Ryan Koontz
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Great. That's helpful. If I can squeeze in one more around what you're seeing in share in North America because of the consolidation with Nokia and Infinera, are you -- do you feel that's been an opportunity of strength for you guys to build more share in the U.S.? Or do you feel your customers are spending more maybe than theirs have traditionally? Are you seeing competitive takeaways? Or is it more just a spending shift where your customers are stronger?


Gary Smith
CEO, President & Director

I actually think we're seeing both, frankly. Because of our leading technology and the investments we made in the very focused technology spend on line system, modem, domain management, we're 18 to 24 months ahead of everybody else on that. Obviously, consolidation is a helpful dynamic in the industry as well for sure. But you're seeing -- I think, at a very similar level, you're seeing service provider return to spending on infrastructure after a sort of underinvestment in for 5 years. So that's a nice dynamic to have, and then you're leaning in on all the AI workloads. It's all about the network. And optical as it moves from electrons to photons, both in the DCI market and eventually in the data center kind of plays to our strength, and that's why we think this is a very durable multiyear fantastic demand dynamic, and we are incredibly well positioned to it. The investments we've made in the last few years really intersect all of the key elements around this high-speed connectivity that's going to be required.


Gregg Lampf
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, everyone. We look forward to catching up with you later today and over the coming weeks. Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We do thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.
