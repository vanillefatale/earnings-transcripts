[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Holden from CIBC.

Paul Holden
CIBC Capital Markets, Research Division

A question on ROE. Now given the 11.3% in '25, wouldn't expect you to increase the target at this point. That's for sure. But just wondering in terms of that 15% target, do you think it's realistic that you could achieve that in 2027 given the pace at which you're executing against your strategy? Is it a realistic objective? Or are we going to have to wait a little bit longer?

Darryl White
CEO & Director

Paul, it's Darryl. So the 15% is still absolutely the target. Thank you for the question. In terms of the timeline, we're pretty clear to say that, that's our medium-term target, which we sort of think about as 3 to 5 years. And we started to establish that language pretty clearly through the course of this year. So it's difficult for me to put a particular date on when we hit the 15% for you right now. But we also have said and I stand by it, that assuming constructive environments, we hope to get there by the early part of this range.

Our next question comes from John Aiken from Jefferies.

John Aiken
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Tayfun, you reiterated your preference for a CET1 ratio, getting closer to 12.5%. You guys are actually a little bit more aggressive in that regard. I'll preface this question by saying that I do agree that 13% is still a little bit too high for you and the group. But how comfortable do you believe that you and BMO are in terms of breaking ranks with the peer group if you drop below 13% before anybody else does?

Tayfun Tuzun
Chief Financial Officer

So John, good question. I will reiterate how we think about our approach to capital management. There are 3 factors that we've been very public about this. One is obviously the regulatory minimums. The second one is the economic -- macroeconomic backdrop and our own performance within that macroeconomic backdrop. And the third one is the peer group distribution. So when we arrived at 12.5% management target, we considered all these 3 points. And we're quite comfortable that at 12.5%. This is a very sound approach to managing our capital ratio. And thus, we've been very public about that for a while now.

Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America.

Ebrahim Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

I guess just 2 questions -- one or 2-part questions since we can only ask one. I guess when we think about the commercial loan growth outlook, ex your optimization actions. I understand that's going to mitigate growth in the near term. But when we look at the U.S., there are obviously mixed signals around what's happening with the economy. Are you actually seeing signs that the tax bill is having an impact on how businesses are behaving around investments and hiring? And when you look at the first half loan growth in the U.S. one, like do you see a pickup? Or do you see risks of downside given the tariff uncertainties? And similarly, in Canada, what needs to happen to really lift the macro overhang if we don't get some clarity on [ CUSMA ] maybe until the back half of '26?

Aron Levine
Group Head & President of BMO U.S.

Ebrahim, thanks for the question. It's Aron. So in terms of the U.S. we're hearing from clients, general optimism, obviously, that's cautious and there's always the questions as you're asking. But generally, we're seeing pickup in activity. We're seeing pipelines grow. We're having good conversations with clients that are feeling generally a level of optimism. For us, in particular, as we think about this inflection point that we're hitting with moving out of optimization towards growth, right, the strength of our commercial relationships that really came through with the fee growth that we showed.

Second, as Darryl mentioned, hiring over 100 commercial bankers and private advisers over the last 12 months. They're just effectively getting going. So you're going to see that benefit us over the next 12 months. And then, of course, our continued investment in both client-facing and internal technology as we get more efficient, make it easier to do business. So for all of those reasons, I feel very confident that we'll start to see the loan growth, as Darryl mentioned, as we get into the second quarter, third quarter of 2026, again, assuming some of the optimism stays and the U.S. economy stays as we think it will.

Ebrahim Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. [indiscernible] on Canada.

Aron Levine
Group Head & President of BMO U.S.

Yes. Here it comes.

Sharon Haward-Laird
Group Head, Canadian Comm. Banking & NA Shared Services, Co-Head, Canadian Personal & Comm. Banking

Thank you. Here it comes. It's Sharon. Thanks for the question. I'd say similar to Aron, I've been out talking to clients, and we would describe the tone as cautiously optimistic. There's obviously a lot of pent-up demand and pipelines are very strong. We did see the end of the fourth quarter was stronger than the beginning of the fourth quarter. So we're seeing good momentum going into this coming year. But we're also really focused on deposit growth. And you see we've taken a lot of market share in operating deposits and our TPS business has had double-digit -- high double-digit growth this year as well. So we've had very strong commercial revenue growth, and we're ready for the CapEx.

On your question of what has to happen. I think at some point, we are starting to see, especially in the middle market, more clients moving and starting to draw down. But utilization rates are still low. So there's room there as well. Obviously, any more certainty will be a positive contributor to things moving. But whenever things pick up, we think we'll be in a good position to take share.

Our next question comes from Gabriel Dechaine from National Bank Financial.

Gabriel Dechaine
National Bank Financial, Inc., Research Division

I know the impaired PCL discussion over the past while it's focused on the U.S., but I want to ask about the Canadian credit card book. We're seeing the delinquency rates there rise above the peer average. We're seeing the balances shrink over the course of the year. And I'm wondering what I should take away from that data? Are you -- did you grow too fast at a certain point in time? Are we maybe going to see a blip in post-Christmas period credit metrics? And then I'll throw this one in there while I'm at it for Darryl, M&A, would you be willing to issue stock to do a deal? Or are you looking at more tuck-in type things?

Mathew Mehrotra
Group Head, Canadian Personal & Business Banking and Co-Head of Canadian Personal & Comm. Banking

Thanks for the question, Gabe. It's Matt speaking. I'll just go back to the comments at the beginning of the call on the macro economy. That -- the overall conditions are definitely affecting mass consumers and particularly the lower end of the credit spectrum, not surprisingly, unemployment and solvency is up. Those stresses are more visible for us given our portfolio composition. We tend to have a smaller premium book, think about sort of large airline co-brand hasn't been a big part of our business up until recently with Porter.

We've made adjustments that manage our exposure to that segment and equally on the flip side are seeing good growth with Porter and sort of our premium segment overall, 16,000 accounts acquired since launch. They have a deep active collector base. So overall, we're looking ahead towards that top end of the market. But I mean, obviously, with the macro conditions as they are, the impact on that lower segment is visible for us, and we're waiting for that improvement.

Our next question comes from Mario Mendonca from TD Securities.

Mario Mendonca
TD Cowen, Research Division

Sort of similar question to what Gabe just asked on acquisitions. There's plenty of speculation that BMO is actively looking to make an acquisition in the U.S. banking. And I know it's difficult for you to comment on that speculation because that would be a speculation, but perhaps you could speak to this. If BMO were to do a deal in the U.S., would you sacrifice that ROE target of 12%, at least for a few years, for the benefit of that increased scale?

Darryl White
CEO & Director

Yes. Okay. So it's Darryl, Mario. Thanks, Gabe, for the question as well. We rolled into the next one pretty quickly. So it's fine. I'll pair them together. The short answer to Mario's question is no, and absolutely no. So let me step back and give you a little bit of color behind that. I think we've been pretty clear about how we think about capital deployment and achieving the ROE targets is the top imperative across the bank and in U.S. banking. So every decision that we make is evaluated through that lens.

Will it support the ROE improvement and sustainable profitable growth or not? That applies to an organic growth decision and it applies to M&A decisions as well. I've also said before good management teams always have their M&A antenna up. But equally, you got to be really disciplined. And we would only take a hard look at anything that met both the strategic and the ROE objectives.

We've discussed a lot about how we're optimizing the redeployment in the United States. You saw it in my comments. You saw it in our new slide. You heard from Aron just now. The reinvestment is targeted at densifying and building local scale in markets where we think we're positioned to compete and win. So that's a really important point when you think about your question. Is there a tuck-in opportunity in those markets that would enable us to continue our ROE journey and not slow it down. In fact, if it would accelerate it, might we look at it? Sure.

But if it doesn't meet those criteria, both strategically and financially, we're not on. Our #1 priority is to grow organically, and we're confident we could do that and reach those objectives with or without M&A.

Mario Mendonca
TD Cowen, Research Division

Okay. And I need one quick clarification on the restructuring. Is that a number you're leaving in the core number? Or are you going to take that out and adjust that for it? It sounds like you're leaving it in, but some clarification?

Tayfun Tuzun
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. We are leaving it in. We've always -- yes, we -- our record is that we typically leave it in.

Our last question comes from Darko Mihelic from RBC.

Darko Mihelic
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I have a 2-part question. Just the first part of this is just a clarification on the corporate segment. Can you just speak to what it was that you did in the quarter that had this segment do much better than the typical loss? And importantly for me is just whatever was done in there, it doesn't seem like it has any kind of impact on the tractoring or anything like that? That's just the most important part of the answer to that.

And the second part of my question is completely unrelated to -- with the disclosure you provided, Piyush, one of the things that -- on NBFI, one of the things I just want to confirm with you is you mentioned in your remarks that the -- there's no losses, so to speak, in a significant part of this book. And I guess, where I am with that is, were there losses in the other parts of the book and specifically, Piyush, I'm very interested in understanding if any part of this NBFI lending contributed to the higher losses we saw in '24 and to some extent '25?

Tayfun Tuzun
Chief Financial Officer

So I'll begin with the first question, Darko. We have not done anything unique this quarter. So if you're asking, like, have you triggered something on your latter investments, et cetera, that resulted in outperformance? No. I think sometimes, we will have quarters when we may have some gains and that go to corporate services. We are doing a very good job in managing the overall liquidity and the low-yielding asset balances, which typically contributes to revenues in corporate services. And it's reflected in our margin improvement as well.

As you can see, I mean, we've done a very good job in managing the margin. But there is nothing unique to the quarter. In some quarters, it happens to be higher. Some quarters, it tends to be lower. But there's nothing that we triggered caused this outcome.

Piyush Agrawal
Chief Risk Officer

Okay. Let me Darko -- it's Piyush, let me talk to the NBFI. So the NBFI sector, you've disclosed information as you saw in the appendix. It's a big part of our business. It's a very profitable part of our business, very high returns. The big piece, as you saw is our equity subscription lines, 50% of it. We've been in this for a long time. I think you understand this business well. Over 99% almost is investment grade, and it's at the epicenter of a one client business of how we take this exposure and have multiproduct relationships across TPS, across wealth, across capital markets.

In the other pieces, again, it's an amalgamation of many forms of clients, but it's well secured, well structured. Over 10 years, I would tell you, the loss rate is one basis point, and some of that came from what we've disclosed 2 years ago in the insurance sector. It's not a typical NBFI segment, but depending on how the nomenclature is, we have included insurance as well. So it's a high-performing, high investment grade, very, very low gross impaired loans. So what I would leave you with is, well secured, well structured, managed by dedicated teams and specialized underwriting criteria.

Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America.

Ebrahim Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

So I guess, Tayfun for you, as we think about the regulatory changes in the U.S., the SLR change, et cetera, does that -- any of that actually impact how you think about the capital levels within BMO's U.S. bank or the holding company? Like could any of that change? And I'm just wondering, as we think about the path to the 12% ROE, is there an element of capital flex that we may be underappreciating, especially in light of what seems like we could have a pretty busy period of rule making in the U.S. around some of the capital requirements?

Tayfun Tuzun
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Good question. Our capital position in the U.S. today and in the coming quarters, we'll continue to be above our peers. So today, the FC has 13.75% CET1 capital. The bank has 14.73% capital. So those are very strong levels. And given our income accretion, they are expected to go up. There is nothing in our ROE outlook that would be achieved by a lower capital position in the U.S. We're currently continuing to keep that accretion. So any changes from a regulatory perspective potentially could give us more flexibility, but we're not baking that into our ROE outlook. Our desire is to continue to utilize that capital supporting our balance sheet growth.

Ebrahim Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. And if I could follow up, maybe, Darryl, for you, given just how frequently bank M&A comes up with any conversation on BMO. One, why would you not want to do a deal in a world with the regulatory backdrop and wide open, you have excess capital. I'm assuming you could deploy some of that U.S. capital in a deal, I get it needs to meet the financial hurdles, but we didn't scale and -- scale be the way to go when you think about density, regional scale a priority for you?

Darryl White
CEO & Director

Okay. Ebrahim, thanks for the question. Look, the first thing is we don't -- we don't think about M&A timing regulatory environment, timing windows. You've seen us do deals in different administrations, and you've seen us do it through different macro environments as well. It's all about whether we have something that fits both strategically and financially, and I've reemphasized on this call the discipline that we're applying to that. And so I'll just come back to my question -- my answer earlier when I say that the focus is on densification and regional scale in markets where we can win. We have a really good strategy that Aron is leading in terms of making sure we have the highest probability of climbing up that ROE curve as fast as possible in the U.S. organically. And right now, that's job one.

If something comes along that fits in the tuck-in category where we can accelerate that and not slow it down, yes, we'll have a good look. Otherwise, we've got other things to do.

Operator

We have no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Darryl White for closing remarks.

Darryl White
CEO & Director

Okay. Thanks, everyone, for your questions this morning. I'll just wrap up by saying we had a really strong 2025, and we're well positioned for the year ahead. As I think about today's call, I'm reminding all of us that we're laser-focused on achieving our ROE imperative as quickly as possible and delivering earnings growth at the same time. And we'll share more on those plans and our outcomes at our Investor Day in March.

Before closing the call, I want to acknowledge the contributions of our CFO, Tayfun, on his last quarterly call before retiring at the end of the year. Over the course of the last 5 years, he has served as an exceptional CFO, executive committee member and trusted adviser, and he has had a tremendous impact on BMO's growth trajectory, strategy and ambition to win. He's taken significant personal initiative to develop the next generation of leaders and strengthen the future of the bank. Tayfun, thank you for your leadership.

And with that, I wish everybody a happy holiday season and look forward to speaking to you again in the New Year.
