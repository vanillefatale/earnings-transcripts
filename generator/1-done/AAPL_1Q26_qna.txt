Question-and-Answer Session

Suhasini Chandramouli
Director of Investor Relations

[Operator Instructions] Operator, may we have the first question, please?

Operator

Certainly. We'll go ahead and take our first question from Amit Daryanani of Evercore.

Amit Daryanani
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Yes, I have 2. Maybe to start with -- there's a lot of focus on the impact of memory to a host of companies, and I'd love to kind of get your perspective when you folks are guiding gross margins up into the March quarter. Just talk about, a, your comfort in securing the bits that you need for shipments? And b, how do we think about memory inflation flowing through Apple's model over time?

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

Yes, Amit, it's Tim. Let me back up a bit and talk about the constraints that Kevan referred to in his remarks and memory and try to get both of these out at once. First of all, we were thrilled with the customer response on the latest iPhone lineup. It exceeded our expectations to say the least. And iPhone grew 23%. What the result of that was, was that we exited the December quarter with very lean channel inventory due to that staggering level of demand.

And based on that, we're in a supply chase mode to meet the very high levels of customer demand. We are currently constrained. And at this point, it's difficult to predict when supply and demand will balance. The constraints that we have are driven by the availability of the advanced nodes that our SoCs are produced on. And at this time, we're seeing less flexibility in supply chain than normal, partly because of our increased demand that I just spoke about.

From a memory point of view, to answer your question, memory had a minimal impact on the Q1, so the December quarter gross margin. We do expect it to be a bit more of an impact to the Q2 gross margin and that was comprehended in the outlook of 48% to 49% that Kevan gave earlier.

Beyond Q2, we don't obviously provide outlooks beyond the current quarter. But we do continue to see market pricing for memory increasing significantly. As always, we'll look at a range of options to deal with that. So hopefully, that gives you the full view.

Amit Daryanani
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I appreciate all the clarity on that, Tim. Maybe the other -- second question I have for you is maybe just touch on the China strength you folks had. I think this is very close to all-time high revenues we've had in China. What's driving the strength over here? And just sort of the durability of the growth rate we saw in the December quarter would be helpful to understand.

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

Sure. Greater China was up 38% year-on-year. It was driven by iPhone where we set an all-time revenue record. So it was the best iPhone quarter in history in Greater China. It's driven by the customer enthusiasm for the iPhone 17 lineup. And I would tell you that during the quarter, traffic in our stores in China grew by strong double digits year-over-year. it was a terrific quarter. Our installed base reached an all-time high in both Greater China and Mainland China. And we set an all-time record for the upgraders and we saw strong double-digit growth on switchers.

And according to a survey from World Panel, iPhones were the top 3 smartphones in urban China during the quarter. So it was -- and it's really driven primarily by the product strength and the customer response to the product strength. We do see on non-iPhone products that the majority of customers that are buying a Mac, an iPad, a watch are still new to that product. So that's a very good sign for us. And if you look at iPad on that same survey iPad was the top tablet model in urban China.

And according to counterpoint the MacBook Air was the top-selling laptop model, and Mac Mini was the top selling desktop model in the December quarter. So Overall, a great quarter in China. We could not be more happy with it.

Suhasini Chandramouli
Director of Investor Relations

Awesome. Thank you, Amit. Operator, could we get the next question, please?

Operator

Our next question is from Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley.

Erik Woodring
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Tim, congrats on announcing the partnership with Google, and we're all excited to see what you bring to market later this year. When I think about your AI initiatives, it's clear there are added costs associated with that. We're obviously seeing that flow through in OpEx. Can you help us understand maybe what the revenue upside potential that exists with AI? Many of your competitors have already integrated AI into their devices. And it's just not clear yet what incremental monetization they're seeing because of AI, but you're always disciplined with investing. You obviously have a differentiated product. So how do you monetize AI? And what's the time line to realizing that ROI? Then a quick follow-up.

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

Well, let me just say that we're bringing intelligence to more of what people love, and we're integrating it across the operating system in personal and private way. And I think that by doing so, it creates great value and that opens up a range of opportunities across our products and services. And we're very happy with the collaboration with Google as well, I should add.

Erik Woodring
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up. Now that you have kind of more time and data to evaluate this cycle, can you maybe help us understand what the primary factors are driving strength in the iPhone? I'm sure there's a number of factors, but if you had to point to 1 or 2, just what would they be? And how sustainable do you think those are?

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

I think it's different for different cohorts of where people are coming from in the device that they have. But it's a combination of things always that make the product thing. It's the display. It's the camera. It's the performance. It's the new selfie camera. It's the design. The design is beloved. And so it's all of these things that come together at once and have -- are producing a very strong product cycle as witnessed by our December quarter results.

Suhasini Chandramouli
Director of Investor Relations

Awesome. Thank you, Erik. Operator, could we get the next question, please?

Operator

We'll now go to Michael Ng of Goldman Sachs.

Michael Ng
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Wonderful. I have 2 as well, if I could. First, it was encouraging to hear about the revenue growth outlook of 13% to 16% for the March quarter. I was just wondering if you could talk about any comps that we should be particularly aware of as we kind of think about each of the product categories? I know last year, you guys had MacBook Air with M4, the iPhone 16E, the iPad A16 and the iPad Air with M3. So just wanted to ask if those things would create tough comps? Or is it just less of an issue just given the new product outlook?

Kevan Parekh
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Mike, it's Kevan. Thanks for the question. Yes, I wouldn't say there's any particular comp issue that we'd note. As you recall, last quarter, we talked about the difficult comparison we had on Mac. But there's nothing that rises to that kind of color that we'd outlined in the outlook. And so I think it's just a continuation of the strong cycle. We're seeing subject to the constraints that I had mentioned in the prepared remarks, and that Tim alluded to a little earlier as well.

Michael Ng
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Great. Wonderful. And then just on services, advertising, strong in the quarter. I wanted to ask about some of the new growth opportunities in advertising. I know you guys are doing the new ad slots in the App Store. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about that? And then any plans to do more in advertising across other products like Maps or TV?

Kevan Parekh
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, sure. Michael, what I would say, just if I step back in general, I think as we outlined, we saw really good broad-based performance in our across our services business, so ranging from all-time records in advertising, music, payment services and cloud services. So I think we see really good opportunities across a lot of our service categories. And we continue to add new service offerings. We talked about what we added to the wallet like Digital ID, and you referenced the additional kind of additional ads coming in the search in the App Store, which we are excited about. It provides advertisers more ways to be discovered.

And so I think we'll continue to look for ways to expand opportunities to add value to users and also create opportunities for Apple. I think as we talked about, we created -- crossed really significant milestone at 2.5 billion active devices. So we really feel excited about the opportunity that provides for our services business as well.

Suhasini Chandramouli
Director of Investor Relations

Thank you, Mike. Operator, could we get the next question, please?

Operator

The next question will be coming from Ben Reitzes of Melius.

Benjamin Reitzes
Melius Research LLC

First question is on Google partnership again. I wanted to understand how you came to that decision with regard to the AI and Siri in particular? And if there's an opportunity for you guys to share in revenue too with that partnership like you do in search?

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

Yes. We basically determined that Google's AI technology would provide the most capable foundation for AFM -- I'm sorry, Apple foundation models. And we believe that we can unlock a lot of experiences and innovate in a key way due to the collaboration. We'll continue to run on the device and run in private cloud compute and maintain our industry-leading privacy standards in doing so. In terms of the arrangement with Google, we're not releasing the details of that.

Benjamin Reitzes
Melius Research LLC

Bummer. Okay. I tried. So yes, you knew it would be me. So the next question is on gross margin. I'm pretty shocked. I got to hand it to you, Tim, that you're able to do 48% to 49%. What's really going on there? How are you doing that with this memory, the NAND prices? Is it due to mix that there's a good -- less hardware and more services and services margins are going up? How are you doing it to go -- to keep it at 48% to 49%?

Kevan Parekh
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Ben, this is Kevan. Let me start maybe by just reflecting on the Q1 gross margin. I think we talked about the fact that we landed at 48.2%. So just above the high end of the range that we provided on the last call. And I think if you look at that performance, we were up 100 basis points sequentially. We talked about the fact that we had favorable mix. I mean, as you know, when we have a good product cycle, a strong price cycle we're seeing for iPhone, that does lend itself to a bit more favorable opportunity on the mix and leverage side. So we're having a strong iPhone cycle, as Tim outlined. And so that also translated itself. We talked about products sequentially went up by 450 basis points.

So I think, in general, I think we're just seeing favorable mix dynamics as well. Services continues to contribute as well. That business is growing double digits. So that also is a contributor. And I think that as we looked at our guidance, we're providing a similar range to where we reported in December. And there's going to be a few puts and takes. We do expect to see favorable mix in the services. As you know, when we move from Q1 to Q2, that tends to be the case, and that's partly offset by a seasonal loss of leverage. So there will be puts and takes. But again, we feel pretty good about the guide of 48% to 49%, which is similar to the range we reported in December.

Suhasini Chandramouli
Director of Investor Relations

All right. Thanks, Ben. Operator, could we get the next question, please?

Operator

The next question will be coming from David Vogt of UBS.

David Vogt
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Maybe Tim or Kevan, if we could pull out a little bit. Can you help us understand how you're thinking about the overall kind of smartphone market demand, particularly given where memory prices are headed? And we've heard some conversations with some other OEMs as well as component providers that are worried about either the availability of components, potential market weakness in terms of demand destruction and some of the actions to offset our higher prices? I know you don't give outlooks for the full year, but how are you thinking about all of those different vectors and what that might mean for the overall smartphone market? And then ultimately, what that might mean for demand for iPhones as we move through the rest of this calendar year?

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

Yes. On the supply side, I had made comments earlier about the constraint that we are seeing in Q2. We -- and that's reflected in the revenue guidance that Kevan gave earlier. The constraint, as I'd mentioned, is due to the advanced node capacity. And it's really a result of growing so well in Q1 with the 23% and having less flexibility partly due to that in the process to increase it as much as we would like to increase it. Beyond Q2, I don't really want to comment on supply. Its -- supply is a function of a lot of things in the industry that move around a lot. So I wouldn't want to comment on that.

And I commented before on the -- on memory pricing. And so hopefully, that answers your question. In terms of smartphone demand, we believe that based on the information that we've got is we gained share in the December quarter. Obviously, the market wasn't growing at 23%. So we feel good about doing that. And -- but I don't -- I wouldn't want to predict how the market reacts in the future. It's very difficult to do that.

David Vogt
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Got it. At the risk of not getting this answered, I'm going to follow up with, can you maybe help us understand, you mentioned there's a range of options that you're looking at. How do -- how should we think about kind of like LTAs in the marketplace? I mean, is that an option as we move through the year? Or is it more spot-based from -- on a perspective, particularly around memory? Just want to get a better sense for how we should think about kind of the dynamics in the marketplace.

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

It's a range. And so I don't want to get more specific than that. I mean there are different levers that we can push and who knows how successful they'll be, but there's just a range of options.

Suhasini Chandramouli
Director of Investor Relations

Great. Thank you, David. Operator, could we get the next question, please?

Operator

We'll now be taking questions from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.

Wamsi Mohan
BofA Securities, Research Division

Tim, on services, you grew a pretty impressive 14%. And I know you said that the App Store was a record for the December quarter. But third-party data is showing a notable deceleration in App Store growth, maybe 7% in the December quarter relative to your 14% growth. I was hoping if you could maybe confirm that. And secondarily, if it's correct, what might be some of the drivers of that? And what could be things that you could do to reverse that in future quarters? And I have a follow-up.

Kevan Parekh
Senior VP & CFO

Wamsi, it's Kevan here. Look, I think we want to reiterate the fact that during the December quarter, we had a quarterly record on the App Store. As you know, we don't provide specific color on how the individual services categories have done. But again, if we step back, I think we saw, again, broad-based growth across all the different categories, also across various geographies. We had all-time records in both developed and emerging markets as well. So -- and double-digit growth in both of those too. And so I think in general, we don't provide the color at the detailed services level.

Wamsi Mohan
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. I guess back to the memory price. I appreciate you have a range of options to address that. Historically, Apple has not used a pricing lever unless FX markets got maybe very dislocated to prevent arbitrage or issues like that. But given some of these unprecedented moves in memory, would pricing be a lever that you would be willing to pull or push outside of every other thing that -- outside of everything else that you can do?

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

Yes, I wouldn't want to speculate on that one.

Suhasini Chandramouli
Director of Investor Relations

Thanks, Wamsi. Operator, could we have the next question, please?

Operator

We'll now go to Samik Chatterjee of JPMorgan.

Samik Chatterjee
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Maybe for the first one, I'm just looking at your capital investment in the first quarter, which did moderate from the last one. And wondering if the partnership with Google on Gemini and sort of help collaboration to develop the next generation of Apple foundation models, does that have any near-term sort of impact on your intent to use Apple Private Cloud? I know you emphasized sort of the role Apple Private Cloud plays in the long term. But are there any changes on that front through this collaboration? Any thoughts around that? And I have a quick follow-up.

Kevan Parekh
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, sure. I think -- this is Kevan here. I think in general, as Tim outlined, we weren't going to provide any details on our arrangement and collaboration with Google. Just speaking of CapEx, in general, as you know, we have a hybrid model for CapEx. And so I think that what happens is our CapEx can be volatile, independent of kind of the volume and the performance of our business. And as you know, our CapEx is made of several different line items that include tooling, our facilities, retail investments -- investments in our retail store, data centers. And on tooling and data centers, we leverage this hybrid model that I mentioned before, which we leverage a combination of first and third-party capacity.

So in general, it's hard to read into the CapEx and draw any conclusions. And so I think I would just say there's going to be some ebbs and flows in CapEx. Last year, remember, we did build out our private cloud compute environment. And so we did have CapEx spending related to that in our results in December.

Samik Chatterjee
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Got it. And my follow-up probably is for you again. You did mention product gross margin and the sort of drivers there for the product gross margin improvement. When you sort of highlighted mix as a driver, can you just sort of talk through what are the big differences in mix you're seeing for iPhone 17 versus 16? And did tariffs and tariffs coming in more favorable play a role at all and what you're expecting for tariffs for the next quarter?

Kevan Parekh
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So there's a few things to unpack there. So on the overall margin on product side, I think I mentioned that we had favorable mix of products and leverage. I think given the strong iPhone cycle we're seeing, that was, I would say, probably a higher favorability than you might have seen in maybe other cycles. And as well, as you know, in Q1, typically, we do see the impact of the cost structure of our new products that we launch. And in this case, we are seeing a more favorable offset from mix of products and leverage versus historical -- sequential changes from Q4 to Q1. On the tariff piece, we had outlined an amount of $1.4 billion for the December quarter, and we landed roughly in that range at that level.

Suhasini Chandramouli
Director of Investor Relations

Awesome. Thank you, Samik. Operator, could we have the next question, please?

Operator

We'll now go to Krish Sankar of TD Cowen.

Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan
TD Cowen, Research Division

The first one I have was for Tim. I think you touched upon this earlier on the Gemini integration and Apple foundation model. How to think about kind of like the difference between Apple foundation model functionality and third-party models? Like does the Apple foundation model evolve to a different layer in the AI software stack? Or how to think about it as you partner with third-party frontier models? And I had a follow-up.

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

Yes. Krish, you should think of it as a collaboration. And we'll obviously independently continue to do some of our own stuff. But you should think of what is going to power the personalized version of Siri is the collaboration with Google.

Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan
TD Cowen, Research Division

Got it. And then, a quick follow-up for maybe Kevan or Tim. Just a lot of discussion on memory pricing. Given that the memory constraint or commodity scarcity is impacting both the smartphone and the PC markets, and Apple, arguably having more purchasing power. Do you think this is a chance for you to increase your market share, both in iPhone and Mac at the expense of competition who might have more constraints in getting access to memory?

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

Yes. I don't want to talk about kind of what has happened. And we do believe, as I had shared that iPhone gained share in the December quarter. And if you look at Mac for the full year of full calendar year '25, we also believe we gained share. And so we feel very good about our position.

Suhasini Chandramouli
Director of Investor Relations

Thank you, Krish. Operator, could we have the next question, please?

Operator

We'll now go to Atif Malik calling from Citi.

Atif Malik
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

The first one for Tim. Tim, some of the industry pundits are comparing the iPhone 17 upgrade cycle to the 2020, 2021 years as some of the iPhone 12, 13 users upgrade. Curious if you agree with that view? And also, if you can layer on the impact from Apple Intelligence to the refresh rate?

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

I think each iPhone cycle has its own unique characteristics. And so I wouldn't compare it to a specific one. I think iPhone 17, the family of 17 is a unique product that brings several very compelling features in one product, and it has done extremely well. And so we feel quite good about it.

Kevan Parekh
Senior VP & CFO

Atif, I'll just add to Tim's comment that we talked about the fact we have a large and diverse installed base of customers. And so this product has really resonated with multiple cohorts, whether you're on older devices or newer iPhones as well. So we've seen really strong reaction to the product lineup.

Atif Malik
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Great. As my follow-up, there was a lot of discussion on supply constraints. And I'm surprised that you guys are constrained on advanced packaging as you generally get your share at the big foundry. How long will these supply impact your ability to ship to true demand?

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

It's difficult to estimate demand when you haven't met the demand. And so we've -- obviously, we have internal estimates on that, but I don't want to share those. But it's very difficult. And just to be clear, it's the advanced nodes that we -- like 3-nanometer to be specific, where our SoCs or the latest SoCs are produced on as to what is gating the Q2 supply. And it's a direct result of the 23% growth, and that far outstripping what we had internally estimated and having more limited flexibility in the supply chain for some period of time. But I don't want to estimate when supply and demand will balance at this point.

Suhasini Chandramouli
Director of Investor Relations

Thank you, Atif. Operator, could we have the next question, please?

Operator

The next question will be coming from Aaron Rakers coming from Wells Fargo.

Aaron Rakers
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I have 2 as well, and I'll try and stay away from the memory question. I'm curious -- and obviously, a lot of focus on the China demand, but I'm curious, you also called out India. And so can you maybe unpack some of the things that you're seeing in the Indian market as far as iPhone traction? Any kind of color on what is a very large installed base in India that seems to be a good growth opportunity for Apple still?

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks for the question. We did set a quarterly revenue record during the December quarter. And to go a little further down, we set quarterly revenue records on iPhone and Mac and iPad and an all-time revenue record on services. So it was a terrific quarter in India. We really like what we see there. It's the second largest smartphone market in the world and the fourth largest PC market. So -- and we still have, despite a very nice growth history, we have modest share there. And so we think there's a huge opportunity for us there. And we could not be more excited about it.

If you look at the -- the other thing that I would point out is that the majority of customers that are buying iPhone and Mac and iPad and watch are all new to that product. And so it speaks very well to opportunity there.

Kevan Parekh
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And Aaron, I'd add, you mentioned the installed base. We're seeing strong double-digit growth in the installed base in India as well, which is really encouraging.

Aaron Rakers
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Yes. And then as a quick follow-up, kind of tied to memory, maybe not so much. But part of this current generation iPhone cycle is you clearly deepened some of your own internal silicon capabilities on the device. I'm curious if that -- if we should think about that as a lever and maybe a supportive factor to gross margin that might be underappreciated? Any thoughts on where we go from here as far as continued opportunities of internalizing your own silicon?

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

Yes. I'll let Kevan talk about the gross margin. But in terms of the product, which is at the heart of what we think about in the user. Apple Silicon has just been an incredible game changer for us, starting with iPhone and then on iPad and of course, the Mac as of a few years ago. And so we believe it's a game changer and a major competitive advantage.

Kevan Parekh
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And as far as impact on gross margin, we have been, as you know, investing in core technologies like our own silicon, our own modem. And certainly, while those do provide opportunities for cost savings and can be reflected in margins, they also importantly provide the differentiation that's really important for our products as well and give us more control of our road map. So I think there's a lot of strategic value to it, but also we are seeing investments in our core technologies impacting gross margin in a positive way.

Suhasini Chandramouli
Director of Investor Relations

Awesome. Thank you, Aaron. Operator, could we have our last question, please?

Operator

Most certainly. Our last question will be coming from Richard Kramer calling from Arete Research.

Richard Kramer
Arete Research Services LLP

I have 2 questions. Tim, when you think about how Apple might manage AI, do you see that evolving towards more edge AI or on device services versus cloud-based AI? And are you confident you've reserved sufficient data center capacity to support the widespread Siri adoption, especially given that you're not following the other hyperscalers and sharply increasing CapEx?

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

The answer is that we see both being important, the on-device and the private cloud compute. And so we don't see it as an either/or we see it as both. And we believe it's a differentiator because of our privacy approach. In terms of do we have enough capacity, it's hard to estimate with precision what the demand will be. But we've done the -- sort of the best job that we can do and either have or are putting capacity in for it.

Richard Kramer
Arete Research Services LLP

Okay. And you also -- you mentioned the $2.5 billion active device number but Apple Intelligence features have only been available since the 15 Pro. So can you speak at all to roughly what portion of your iPhone or overall active device installed base is now AI capable? And has this been a factor in maybe a more gradual pace of launching wider AI services?

Kevan Parekh
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Richard, this is Kevan. We don't provide that specific number, but it is a growing number, as you can imagine in our installed base. And so we're encouraged by the amount of devices now that are capable, but we're not going to provide a specific figure on that today.

Suhasini Chandramouli
