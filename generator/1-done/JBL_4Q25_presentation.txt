Greetings, and welcome to the Jabil Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results and Investor Briefing. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Adam Berry. Please go ahead, sir.

Adam Berry
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Communications

Good morning, and welcome to Jabil's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Call. This is also Jabil's eighth Annual Investor Briefing. I'm Adam Berry, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Affairs. This is an important day for us at Jabil, and we appreciate your continued interest in our company.

Our investor briefing is always one of the highlights of our calendar. It's our opportunity to step back from the quarter-to-quarter rhythm and give you a deeper look at how we're shaping the business, how we're allocating capital, and how we're positioning Jabil for sustainable long-term growth.

Before we dive in, I need to cover a quick but important point. Some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding our financial guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year 2026 and our future business outlook.

These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our expectations. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Now let me set the stage for what we'll cover today.

You're going to hear from a number of our leaders across the organization, each of them will bring their perspective on Jabil's performance, opportunities and direction. We'll begin with Greg Hebard, our Chief Financial Officer, who will walk through our fiscal 2025 results and share the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2026. Greg will also frame how we think about the balance sheet free cash flow and capital allocation.

Next, Steve Borges will cover regulated industries. This is a critical part of our business, encompassing health care, automotive and transportation, and renewable and energy infrastructure. These are markets where quality and trust are nonnegotiable, and Steve will share both the near-term realities and the long-term opportunities.

After Steve, you'll hear from Matt Crowley, who leads intelligent infrastructure. This is our fastest-growing segment and the growth is being fueled by unprecedented demand for AI-related systems from semiconductor capital equipment to racks servers and advanced cooling solutions. Matt will explain how Jabil is positioned to capture this wave of growth with system-level integration that very few companies can deliver.

Following Matt, Andy Priestley will take us through Connected Living & Digital Commerce. This is a segment in transition as we deliberately move away from lower-margin legacy consumer programs and strengthen our position in automation and advanced technologies. Andy will share how this pivot is improving the quality of earnings today and positioning Jabil for long-term opportunity in robotics, warehouse automation and next-generation connected devices.

Finally, we'll conclude with our CEO, Mike Dastoor with help from EVP of Operations, Fred McCoy, and Chief Supply Chain and Procurement Officer, Frank McKay. Mike and team will bring it all together by describing how our portfolio strategy, capital allocation discipline and culture of execution position Jabil to thrive in an evolving market. You'll also hear from Mike about the priorities that guide us, serving our customers with precision, driving sustainable earnings growth and returning significant value to shareholders.

All in, we expect today to give you a clear, transparent picture of how Jabil is positioned not just for fiscal 2026, but for the years ahead. With that, let's get started. It's my pleasure to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Greg Hebard.

Gregory Hebard
Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Adam. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin this morning with our Q4 results. For the fourth quarter, our team delivered strong performance, reaching approximately $8.3 billion in revenue, which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by roughly $800 million. This better-than-expected growth was broad-based as all 3 segments came in higher than anticipated.

Driven by strong underlying revenue growth, core operating income for the quarter came in at $519 million, well above the high end of our expected range. Our core operating margin was 6.3% of revenue, representing a 50 basis point improvement year-over-year. Net interest expense for Q4 was $65 million. On a GAAP basis, operating income totaled $337 million and diluted earnings per share came in at $1.99.

Core diluted earnings per share was $3.29. Moving on to our segment performance for Q4. Regulated Industries revenue was $3.1 billion, reflecting stronger-than-anticipated growth. Health care was in line, while renewable and energy infrastructure and automotive and transportation, both exceeded expectations, supported by incentive-related demand pull forward and stronger volumes across core programs.

On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased approximately 3% and core operating margin expanded by 40 basis points to 6.5% driven by a better mix. Turning to intelligent infrastructure, where revenue for Q4 was $3.7 billion, $400 million above expectations. The upside was driven primarily by 3 factors within cloud and data center.

First, we reached efficiency faster than planned for more than 700 new employees hired and trained as we move multiple sites to 24/7 operations in Q3, which lifted shipments. Second, we benefited from a more favorable mix versus Q3, leading to higher average selling prices. And third, in storage, we ramped our second hyperscaler faster than expected and saw stronger-than-anticipated end-of-quarter demand from traditional storage customers.

Core operating margin for this segment was 5.9%. In Connected Living & Digital Commerce, revenue totaled $1.4 billion, coming in slightly ahead of our outlook from 90 days ago. On a year-over-year basis, revenue declined approximately 14%, primarily due to softness in consumer-driven products. This was partially offset by continued growth in warehouse and retail automation.

Core operating margin for this segment was 6.6% in Q4, up 210 basis points year-over-year. The increase reflects cost actions taken earlier in the year and a deliberate shift towards higher-margin programs and markets within the segment. Let's move to our cash flow and balance sheet metrics.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, inventory ended at 69 days, a 5-day improvement from last quarter. Including inventory deposits, net inventory days were 55, down 4 days sequentially. This working capital discipline supported strong cash generation with cash from operations of $588 million in the quarter and $1.64 billion for the year.

Net CapEx expenditures were $83 million in Q4 and $322 million for the full year or 1.1% of revenue. Full year adjusted free cash flow came in very strong at more than $1.3 billion. We exited the fiscal year with a healthy balance sheet with debt to core EBITDA of 1.3x, and cash balances of approximately $1.9 billion.

During the fourth quarter, we completed our prior $1 billion share repurchase authorization, consistent with our framework to return 80% of annual adjusted free cash flow to shareholders. With that, let's now turn to our capital structure.

We ended FY '25 with $4 billion of unused capacity under our global credit facilities. Including that capacity and our year-end cash balance Total available liquidity exceeded $5.9 billion. Our debt and liquidity position remains strong and well structured. Maturities are appropriately staggered and carry attractive interest rates. Importantly, we remain fully committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit profile.

Let's now turn to capital allocation and return to shareholders. Since FY '13, we've reduced our shares outstanding from 203 million to 107 million in FY '25, a 47% decline driven by our disciplined share repurchase strategy. Over that period, we've repurchased 136 million shares at an average price of approximately $52 contributing to total shareholder returns of $7.7 billion, including both dividends and buybacks.

As a reminder, in July, our Board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, giving us continued flexibility to return capital thoughtfully and opportunistically, we intend to fully execute the current authorization in fiscal '26. With that, let's turn to the next slide for our Q1 FY '26 guidance.

Beginning with revenue by segment. For Q1, we anticipate regulated industries revenue will be $3.05 billion, up 3% year-on-year as we expect some of the dynamics that benefited Q4, particularly in automotive and renewables to carry into the early part of the first quarter. For our Intelligent Infrastructure segment, we expect strong growth to continue with revenue for the quarter to be $3.67 billion, up approximately 47% year-over-year. We expect this increase to be driven by sustained broad-based AI-related growth in cloud data center infrastructure and capital equipment markets.

In our Connected Living & Digital Commerce segment, revenues are expected to be $1.29 billion, down 16% year-on-year. This reflects continued softness in consumer-centric products, offset slightly by growth in warehouse and retail automation markets. It's important to note that some of the year-on-year decline is intentional as we focus on strengthening the quality of the portfolio by exiting or pruning lower-margin programs and remixing the segment toward more durable growth opportunities.

Putting it all together at the enterprise level, total company revenue for Q1 is expected to be in the range of $7.7 billion to $8.3 billion. Core operating income for Q1 is estimated to be in the range of $400 million to $460 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $263 million to $343 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $2.47 to $2.87.

GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.27 to $1.84. Net interest expense for the fourth quarter is estimated to be approximately $64 million. And for the year, we expect to be in the range of $240 million to $250 million. Our core tax rate for Q1 and for the year was expected to be 21%, consistent with FY '25.

In summary, turning to the next slide. FY '25 was marked by disciplined execution. We sharpened the portfolio, improved business mix, delivered strong margins and converted that execution into strong free cash flow. These results highlight the strength of our diversified model and the alignment of our business with secular growth drivers. We enter fiscal '26 well positioned to continue delivering growth, margin expansion and robust free cash flow. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve.

Steven Borges
Executive Vice President of Global Business Units

Hello. I'm Steve Borges, and I lead Jabil's regulated industry segment. This segment spans 3 major areas: automotive and transportation, health care and renewables and energy infrastructure. Each of these markets are undergoing significant transformation. And our engineering led teams are deeply engaged in helping customers navigate that change with speed, precision and a focus on long-term value.

Let's start with automotive and transportation. This industry is emerging from a global market correction. And while near-term growth in battery electric vehicles has slowed, the long-term outlook remains strong. Regulatory shifts, changing incentives and trade pressures, particularly around Chinese EVs and U.S. tariffs are reshaping OEM strategies.

Customers continue to design platforms that can be leveraged across their entire portfolio versus being specific to an EV, hybrid or ICE vehicle. As such, and throughout the softness in automotive, Jabil continues to add new customers in vehicle-agnostic programs, helping to bring more stability to the business. We are leaning into technologies that will define industry's future, software-defined vehicles, advanced driver assistance systems, compute, and other powertrain agnostic solutions are all growth areas.

Jabil continues to bring differentiated value by our engineering-led engagements as well as our strategic collaborations, like the one we announced recently with AVL to co-develop designs and manufacturing solutions for the automotive and transportation market. Beyond specific collaborations, our automotive teams continue to strengthen partnerships through execution and capability expansion. That combination of technical know-how and trusted relationships positions us well as this market continues its transformation.

Turning to health care. We see an equally dynamic environment shaped by innovation, demographics and patient needs. Connected Care continues to create new markets, enabling care delivery in ways that are more accessible and more personal. Personalized medicine is driving improved outcomes for chronic diseases, while new care settings from hospitals to the home are broadening opportunities for innovation.

At the same time, health care companies face growing pressure to simplify their supply chains. This is where Jabil adds unique value. Our scale, quality systems and engineering expertise allows us to provide comprehensive solutions that are difficult for others to replicate.

Our acquisition of Pii has brought us into the CDMO space. And our sterilization initiative is opening doors with new customers. We're also advancing our capabilities in minimally invasive devices, medical device reprocessing and injectables, including GLP-1s and biologics, which remain a key area of focus.

We remain committed to expanding our capabilities, whether through M&A or organic growth. We are unlocking new markets, creating more value for our customers and further differentiating Jabil in a competitive landscape. In short, Jabil is helping health care innovators bring life-changing solutions to patients faster, more reliably and at scale.

Finally, in renewables and energy infrastructure, the macro picture is dynamic. Global electricity demand is projected to increase by as much as 70% by 2040, driven in large part by the growth of data centers and industrial use. Meanwhile, interest rates, tariffs, and policy changes are reshaping near-term demand in areas like solar and energy storage. Even with these shifts, we've been able to support our customers without disruption, including complex product transfers. Despite the headwinds, renewables remain the fastest-growing and lowest-cost source of new energy.

Solar continues to be the largest driver of growth worldwide, while energy storage systems and grid modernization are increasingly critical to balancing supply and demand. Here again, Jabil is leaning into complexity, supporting customers with design and manufacturing capabilities that extend from inverters to battery modules to smart grid technologies. We're also embedding ourselves deeper into building infrastructure.

We're rising demand for HVAC systems, especially for data centers and the increasing need for modern security and access control solutions present strong opportunities. Across these markets, our ability to combine engineering depth with global manufacturing scale gives us a distinctive edge. To sum it up, in automotive and transportation, health care and renewables and energy infrastructure, our strategy is thoughtful and deliberate.

We build capabilities that matter. We deliver with speed and quality and stay ahead of what's next. This is how we're helping customers solve complex challenges in regulated environments, while driving long-term growth and value for Jabil and our shareholders. Thank you.

Matt Crowley
Executive Vice President of Global Business Units

Good morning, everyone. For those you, I haven't met, my name is Matt Crowley, and I lead Jabil's Intelligent Infrastructure business. My team and I are focused on enabling growth across 3 key end markets that sit at the heart of today's technology transformation. Capital equipment, cloud and data center infrastructure and networking and communications, AI and advanced compute are driving one of the most profound infrastructure build-outs in decades.

At the same time, our customers are demanding speed, resiliency and cost efficiency and how they scale. Our role is clear: to be the trusted engineering-led manufacturing partner that helps our customers scale faster integrate more seamlessly and deploy new platforms with confidence and what differentiates Jabil is that we're positioned across the entire AI hardware ecosystem, not just a single piece of the puzzle, but the combination of compute, storage, networking, power, cooling and the tools that make all of this possible.

Let me start with cloud and data center infrastructure. This is where the acceleration of AI workloads is most visible. The largest global platforms are redesigning servers, racks and data center architectures around liquid cooling, next-generation processors and unprecedented bandwidth demand. Our strategy is to engage at the rack scale level. Instead of selling individual parts, we're integrating full racks into one deliverable system. That's a huge differentiator. It shortens our customers' time to deployment and allows them to scale with confidence. We've also aligned our footprint with these needs. In North America, for example, we're standing up new capacity that is purpose-built for liquid cooled racks.

That gives our customers not only scale, but also the regional diversification they're asking for. Another critical piece of our data center strategy is thermal management, as processors get hotter and denser, traditional air-cooled solutions aren't enough. We're investing in advanced cooling technologies and integrating them into our data center platforms and power is just as important as cooling. We're expanding into low and medium volt switch gear, PDUs and UPS systems, integrating them directly into rack and data center designs, this allows us to deliver a truly end-to-end solution, where compute, networking, power and cooling all come together in one integrated system.

Turning to capital equipment. This is the technology that underpins the entire semiconductor industry from wafer fabrication to automated test equipment, the capital equipment market is where the building blocks of AI infrastructure are created. Here, our strategy is to move closer to the chamber to the most critical parts of the tool or precision, quality and reliability matter most.

We're working with leading equipment makers to expand our role in RF power systems, gas delivery sensors and other chamber adjacent technologies. By doing this, we become more embedded in our customers' platforms, which makes us harder to replace and more valuable over time. We're also investing in geographic expansion to align with our customers' global supply chain. That means adding capability in India, Poland, Southeast Asia, so that when our customers expand capacity, we're already there to support them.

The same thermal management automation and precision manufacturing techniques we use in semiconductor tools are being leveraged in data center and networking applications. That's the power of having a portfolio that spans multiple interconnected markets. The third piece of intelligent infrastructure is networking and communications. Here, our strategy is anchored in liquid cooled switching and system-level integration. The explosive growth of AI workloads is driving unprecedented bandwidth requirements.

And traditional air cooled networking gear is no longer sufficient. We're investing in liquid cooled switch technology, integrating it with compute, power and thermal solutions to deliver complete rack level systems. This is a space where Jabil is uniquely positioned, because we're not just supplying a switch. We're engineering the entire system around it. And we continue to focus on our silicon photonics business, where we've developed advanced packaging capabilities to support the ongoing scale-out of transceiver platforms and the backbone of high-speed optics and our strategic focus remains at the system level, where all elements of the rack architecture are converting. So let me bring it all together. Our customers are no longer looking at servers, racks or switches in isolation. They're designing entire systems that must work together seamlessly.

And Jabil is positioned uniquely to deliver that. By operating across capital equipment, data center infrastructure and networking, we bring insights and capabilities from each domain into the others creating leverage that few competitors can match, by executing flawlessly for our existing partners and continuing to invest in differentiated capabilities, we're laying the foundation not only for today's demand, but for the data center and networks of the future. Thank you.

Andy Priestley
Executive Vice President of Global Business Units

Hello. I'm Andy Priestley, and I lead Jabil's connected living and digital commerce segment. This segment is built around 2 major areas: Consumer Devices and Digital Commerce & Robotics. Together, they represent the diverse and dynamic mix of technologies that was shaping how people live, shop and interact with the world around them. Let's start with Digital Commerce & Robotics, where the pace of change is past us.

This part of our business includes retail automation e-commerce, robotics and AI-driven systems that are being fueled by powerful mega trends. Across the supply chain, full scale automation has taken hold from lights-out warehouses to autonomous last mile delivery, physical retail is being reimagined through smart shelf labels, Connectivity & Robotics, turning stores into digital assets that support omnichannel experiences.

Payment technologies are also evolving fintech and biometrics are transforming how transactions happen, particularly in small and medium-sized markets, where contactless and custom point-of-sale solutions are becoming the norm.

Turning to automated retail. This market segment is growing very quickly, driven by demand for speed, convenience and self-service in areas such as autonomous vending and ghost kitchens. Lastly, robotics and AI are both advancing quickly. Gen AI and large language models are enabling robots even humanoid to learn from existing models and images, making them more adaptable, capable and widespread.

At Jabil, we're investing in engineering and design expertise that allows us to support the most complex and demanding technologies in the market. From computer vision and high-speed automation to complex assembly we're enabling the next generation of intelligent systems. These strengths are also opening doors in fast growing end markets where innovation and flawless execution are nonnegotiable.

The shift towards more complex, higher-value technologies is driving margin expansion and positioning Jabil as a key enabler of next-generation commerce. This is where Jabil moves up the value chain, not just producing systems but partnering with customers to solve labor challenges, improve performance and deliver better customer experiences. Jabil is the largest manufacturing solutions provider for digital commerce and warehouse automation customers.

Our scale and expertise allows us to support the largest players in this industry as they navigate today's challenges and beyond. On the consumer device side, we're focused on products that enhance everyday life from small and major appliances to home comfort and outdoor living. Consumers want smarter, more connected products enabled by AI, machine learning and IoT.

Wireless power, energy efficiency and intuitive interfaces are becoming standard. At the same time, there's a growing appetite for creating experiences at home, bringing indoor comfort outboards and elevating how people live. Safety and security is becoming a critical pillar of our future success. Our work in commercial drones and vision systems continues to support safer environment and a more enjoyable experience.

We're extremely proud of the innovation happening in these areas. While segment revenues show a slight year-over-year decline, the underlying story reflects a thoughtful evolution towards more sophisticated technology in Digital Commerce & Robotics. Over time, we will concentrate our consumer device business in areas where our engineering debt provide margin accretive opportunities with premium brands. It's also very important to note that our consumer business remains a vital driver of positive cash flow, helping to fuel the innovation and investment that power our growth in areas such as automation, AI and robotics.

Connected Living and Digital Commerce segment has been playing a major role in our geographic mix shift, since 2023 with strategic moves from China to Mexico. That said, China remains essential to our future success. It continues to teach the world how to manufacture with efficiency at scale, and we value its role in the larger ecosystem.

To summarize, the Connected Living & Digital Commerce segment is evolving quickly. We're enabling smarter systems, more connected experiences and helping our partners stay ahead of the curve. That's how Jabil is creating value today while building the foundation for long-term growth.

In closing, I'd like to thank the extended team for what has been an exceptional year. This team has delivered record performance and won multiple new programs with new and existing customers. Thank you.

Michael Meheryar Dastoor
CEO & Director

Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As you heard from the group today, fiscal 2025 was a great year for Jabil. We delivered solid revenue growth, expanded core operating margins, grew core EPS and generate strong free cash flow and extremely strong return on invested capital. Upon taking a closer look, the dynamics varied by end market.

In regulated industries, automotive and renewable face pressure. In sharp contrast, Intelligent Infrastructure was a growth engine as AI-related demand accelerated across capital equipment, data center and networking. And in Connected Living and digital commerce, we continue to rationalize the portfolio and execute a deliberate mix shift, deemphasizing lower-margin legacy consumer programs while strengthening our position in advanced warehouse and retail automation.

So stepping back, FY '25 demonstrated 2 things at once. Some end markets were choppy, yet the company remained resilient, where automotive and renewables slowed, AI-driven demand more than offset where consumer categories soften, CLDC expanded margins through portfolio pruning. And across the enterprise, free cash flow came in extremely strong. Let me take a moment to talk about what sets Jabil apart, what we call the Jabil Advantage. Our competitive success is driven by the effective integration of 5 key pillars.

First, our long-tenured team and culture of operational execution. Around the world, teams deliver with safety, quality and accountability. In a complex environment that consistency is difference between promises and performance. Second, our regional manufacturing footprint. Over the past decade, we've shifted to a regionalized model, designing, building and delivering products, where they're consumed. In today's environment of tariffs, policy shifts and supply chain complexity this is proven to be a clear competitive advantage.

Our geographic mix has also transformed. In FY '18, we were heavily weighted towards Asia. By FY '25, our revenue profile is more balanced, resilient and flexible. 2 factors drove the shift. The FY '24 divestiture of our Mobility business, which reduced concentration and free resources for higher growth opportunities and the rapid build-out of AI infrastructure in the U.S., which raised our Americas share of revenue from 25% in FY '18 to 46% in FY '25.

This improved balance highlights the strength of Jabil's strategy, building capabilities everywhere to serve customers wherever they operate. Third, scale rationalization and diversification. Hundreds of customers across a number of end markets trust us with mission-critical programs. That diversification provides both stability and optionality as technologies converge and market demand shifts.

Today, as we continue to scale in AI-related growth areas, rationalized part of our portfolio, particularly in CLDC and diversify further within customers and end markets, those same strengths are what positioned Jabil to keep delivering through various cycles. Fourth, supply chain orchestration. We managed one of the world's most complex supply chains with over 38,000 global suppliers and over 700,000 unique parts, which enables us to help customers redesign biller materials, qualify new suppliers and secure continuity.

That capability matters most when markets are tight or trade policy shift. And finally, our last pillar is automation and AI inside our factories. As programs move into higher cost regions, competitiveness depends not just on labor cost, but also on labor availability and the concentration of skilled workers in certain areas.

To address this, we embed robotics, predictive maintenance, automated optical inspection and scheduling optimization, to name a few, across our operations. These tools improve quality, accelerate ramps and reduce cost. With more than 30 sites in the U.S., our footprint here has never been larger. At this time, I would like to invite Fred to discuss how we are leveraging AI and automation throughout our factory network followed by Frank, who will share insights into how advanced AI tools are enabling and optimizing our supply chains.

Frederic McCoy
Executive Vice President of Operations

Thanks, Mike. I'm Fred McCoy, and I lead Jabil's global operations. At Jabil, we're building the future of manufacturing, where intelligent automation, AI-driven processes and a fully connected ecosystem empower our people to deliver value to customers and elevate our performance. The reality is that we've been using AI and operations for years.

On our production lines, we deployed several thousand proprietary cameras with embedded AI computer vision models for in-line quality inspections. We use tools for modeling our inventory levels and logistics planning, and we optimize our equipment utilization across our network. By connecting our more than 400 SMT lines and now our injection molding and CNC machining equipment, we're deploying AI agents to to categorize and optimize downtime, attrition and yield loss, which helps us self-correct and improve efficiency and make faster decisions. We've deployed generative AI tools that give our operators quick access to the information they need on the manufacturing floor.

This means problems can be solved in place without interrupting production and teams have more confidence in the data behind their decisions. Simultaneously, automation is expanding rapidly across our network. Today, we have more than 25,000 robots in production and a team of over 2,000 trained automation engineers and technicians. They design, build and maintain solutions ranging from simple robotic arms to complex high-speed systems.

For mid-volume production, our proprietary modular gear delivered flexible and cost effective automation that can reconfigured as products change, lowering costs and accelerating deployment. We've also developed and are deploying a blueprint for material automation, including autonomous guided vehicles and automated storage and retrieval systems. These solutions improve safety, provide real-time material traceability and eliminate millions in manual handling costs.

Across the industry and at Jabil, investment in AI and automation is accelerating. Our job is to embrace these technologies, partner with customers and suppliers and industrialize them at scale across our facilities. The future of our factories will bring even more collaboration between people and machines and our employees will focus on higher-value tasks that drive quality, safety and innovation. The result will be a new level of agility, traceability and competitiveness that sets Jabil apart in the marketplace.

I'll now pass it off to Frank to talk about the work we're doing in embedding AI into our procurement and supply chain processes.

Francis McKay
Senior VP and Chief Supply Chain & Procurement Officer

Thank you, Fred. Hello. My name is Frank McKay, and I lead Jabil's global procurement and supply chain operations. At Jabil, we are integrating AI into every layer of our supply chain to make it smarter and more resilient. Our vision is an autonomous supply chain, built in an AI technology stack that combines machine learning, agentic AI and generative AI with Jabil's decades of global experience. One example is [ V-command ], our supply chain intelligence and orchestration platform. [ V-command ] gives our global teams full end-to-end visibility and provides customers with a secure window into their supply chain by connecting real-time data across our ecosystem, we can break down silos, run simulations and act quickly on the most important insights.

AI-powered dashboards and intelligent alerts help us prioritize issues as they arise real time. Whether that means mitigating supply risk, tracking shipments or improving freight performance. The platform is also evolving with an AI-driven road map that includes new capabilities, such as end-to-end supply chain footprint mapping, disruptive event management and advanced tariff analytics.

These features will build on the intelligent dashboards and alerts that are already in place, giving our teams and our customers even greater resiliency, transparency and speed to action. We also use AI in our proprietary procurement intelligence platform, which brings together billions of data points from millions of parts and suppliers.

With this data, we can benchmark costs run sourcing scenarios and negotiate with much greater speed than ever before. And in one particular case, we were just a sourcing cycle from 2 weeks to 1 day across hundreds of thousands of parts, freeing up our teams to focus on far more strategic efforts.

Through IDA Global, our joint venture with Cyferd a native AI SaaS provider, we're advancing even further. This platform combines Jabil's supply chain expertise with Cyferd self-learning AI to autonomously manage multi-tier supply chains, respond to disruptions in real time and deploy new applications in weeks rather than months.

Together, these tools are reshaping our procurement and supply chain management works at Jabil by embedding AI into our operations, we're improving agility, transparency, and efficiency of setting a new standard for overall supply chain performance. I'd now like to pass it back off to Mike.

Michael Meheryar Dastoor
CEO & Director

Thanks, Frank. As you just heard from the team, the 5 pillars are not abstract. They shape how we operate in highly regulated markets, how we capture AI growth in intelligent infrastructure and how we're reshaping CLDC for margin and durability. With that, I'd now like to walk you through the dynamics across each of our segments for FY '26.

I'll begin with regulated industries. Think of regulated industries as the place for reliability, compliance and quality are nonnegotiable. The near-term picture is mixed, but the long-term themes are positive. I'll start with the headwinds are most visible in the short term. While EV adoption is strong in China in both the U.S. and Europe, demand has slowed, at intensifying competition among automakers is affecting customer market share and influencing technology strategies.

These dynamics will weigh on FY '26. As a result, we believe our auto and transport end market will decline by 5%. Even so, there is reason for optimism. The long-term trends remain promising as BEV still represents the fastest-growing powertrain. This, in addition to the adoption of software-defined vehicles and ADAS is increasing the content per vehicle.

The team is deeply embedded with leading OEMs on the technologies that are expected to define the industry's future, compute modules, advanced driver assistance systems, and other powertrain agnostic solutions are all growth areas as we support our customers' next-generation vehicles.

And in renewables, and energy infrastructure over the last 2 years, we have helped customers rebalance portfolios, localized supply chains and diversify across commercial and residential projects. These actions improve resilience now and position us for upside as economics, interest rates and demand improve. Said differently, we have done the blocking and tackling to be ready when demand improves.

By contrast, we believe health care outsourcing is entering a growth phase. Growth in FY '26 is expected to be led by drug delivery systems, including GLP-1 auto injectors and on-body monitoring, such as continuous glucose monitors. Although these programs have long incubation lead times, they are sticky for customers valuable for patients and margin accretive for Jabil.

It's worth noting health care with a healthy pipeline of new business awarded is expected to be an important contributor to our path towards 6% core operating margins. Putting the segment together in FY '26, we expect regulated industries to be flat on revenue with margin expansion as health care growth helps offset automotive and renewables. If regulated industries is about trust and durability, intelligent infrastructure is about velocity.

Our strategy here is clear: win at the system level. Instead of treating servers, racks, switches, power and cooling as separate silos, we design and deliver integrated systems that combine compute, networking, power distribution and advanced cooling that integration shortens time to deploy and lowers total cost for customers exactly what they need as AI capacity scales.

You can see the strategy at work across the 3 end markets in this segment. In capital equipment, we're moving closer to the chamber with RF power, gas delivery and sensors, capabilities at the heart of semiconductor tools that manufacture AI chips. As AI continues to drive demand for more large memory and system-on-chip designs, we expect demand for automated test equipment to remain strong for the foreseeable future.

As we said today, we expect another strong year with 16% revenue growth year-over-year. And in cloud and data center infrastructure, we operate at rack scale, designing and delivering complete systems with advanced liquid cooling and integrated power spanning low- and medium-voltage switchgear and other solutions that enable power delivery from grid to chip and thermal management from chip to the outside.

And in networking and communications, we are scaling liquid cooled switching today, while preparing for the eventual shift to co-packaged optics as the industry standards mature. In the meantime, pluggable optics remain the backbone and we continue to build those platforms. Strength in networking is expected to be offset with continued softness in the 5G infrastructure market.

Putting it all together for the AI segment, Jabil's engineering-led system-level capabilities extend across multiple interconnected markets in the AI space. That reach enable us to transfer technologies and connect these markets seamlessly and it's this integration that stands out as a key differentiator, placing us right at the center of the AI ecosystem.

In FY '24, our AI-related revenue stood at approximately $5 billion, rising to approximately $9 billion in FY '25 as we brought on additional capacity in the U.S. Looking ahead, we expect AI-related revenue to grow by roughly 25% in FY '26, reaching about $11.2 billion. It's worth noting that demand continues to be extremely strong, as evidenced by our recent performance.

However, it's also worth noting that we're now bumping up against capacity in the U.S. As you may recall, in June, we announced a new facility in North Carolina to address these capacity constraints. Notably, this new state of the art side is set to come online in the summer of 2026 and will serve as a showcase for Jabil's AI rack manufacturing capabilities and will be designed from day 1 with key partner capabilities like NVIDIA's Omniverse and Endeavors power and cooling solutions, which positions us very well to meet future demand with greater agility and expertise.

Once operational, we expect the site to empower us to sustain robust double-digit growth in AI-related revenue in fiscal '27 and beyond. For FY '26, overall, we expect Intelligent Infrastructure revenue to grow 18% with double-digit contributions from cloud and data center and from capital equipment.

Segment margins should remain consistent with Jabil's overall level in the mid-5% range. Turning now to our CLDC segment, which is in the midst of a planned transition and the logic is straightforward. On one hand, we are pruning lower margin short life cycle programs in legacy consumer electronics that don't match the margin profile we desire. On the other hand, we're investing where growth and margin is stronger, like digital commerce, where automation has become essential for customers to accelerate the delivery of products to and from fulfillment centers and physical stores.

We design, manufacture and scale robotics, warehouse automation systems and physical AI platforms, helping customers move from pilots to global deployments with speed and confidence. Over time, we expect our early engagement in humanoid will be another option for growth and diversification.

In Connected Living, the pivot is towards advanced technologies, wireless power, human machine interfaces and connectivity platforms. We pair these technologies with legalized manufacturing in Mexico, Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia to shorten supply chains and reduce tariff exposure. The anticipated result is a smaller yet healthier business with better earnings quality.

For FY '26, we expect CLDC revenue declined about 13%. So what does all this mean for the enterprise level? Yes, the FY '26 outlook. Collectively, our portfolio remains balanced and well positioned for sustainable value creation. For FY '26, we expect approximately 5% revenue growth to about $31.3 billion.

We expect core operating margin to expand by roughly 20 basis points to around 5.6% in spite of the underutilized capacity in multiple geographies. Core earnings per share is expected to be $11 in FY '26, and we anticipate free cash flow to be greater than $1.3 billion.

Moving on to capital allocation. Our priorities are straightforward. First, we'll invest organically in the highest return areas such as AI infrastructure, health care and advanced warehouse and retail automation. Second, we pursue acquisitions that build capability and where it makes sense, step into higher-value markets, where we bring something distinctive to customers.

Our M&A philosophy is simple. 1 plus 1 must equal 3. Third, over time, we expect to return about 80% of free cash flow to shareholders through a mix of buybacks and dividends, while maintaining a strong, flexible balance sheet. The filter is simple. Every dollar must raise returns, build resilience or both.

Looking beyond FY '26, here is the long-term model. Stepping past the next 4 quarters, our focus is unchanged. We target 6% plus core operating margins and north of $1.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow over time. How do we get there? 3 levels: first, better mix leaning into health care, AI and digital commerce, where our system-level capabilities can be leveraged best. Second, better execution, embedding automation, AI and robotics in our operations to raise quality and speed, while lowering cost; third, better capacity utilization across our global network. So every site contributes more often.

In short, better mix, better execution, better asset terms. Before I close the word to our people. Strategy is only as strong as the team that runs it. In Asia, the Americas and Europe, I see the same hallmarks as I visit Jabil sites, a commitment to safety, respect, culture and belonging, execution and customer focus. Thank you for what you do every day for our customers and communities.

Let me close by answering a straightforward question. Why do I feel Jabil is uniquely positioned for continued success. Let me bring it back to where I began. FY '25 demonstrated the strength of our diversified resilient portfolio and our ability to successfully navigate a complex and dynamic tariff environment even as market conditions shifted and geopolitical uncertainty increased. Our competitive edge is clear, system-level engineering expertise, robust regionalized manufacturing footprint and global scale, world-class supply chain management and a culture that executes.

We are powering the build out of AI infrastructure, operating with precision in regulated markets, automating digital commerce and building capabilities such as humanoids for the future, all while consistently returning the vast majority of cash flow to shareholders. Thank you. I'll now turn it back over to Adam.
