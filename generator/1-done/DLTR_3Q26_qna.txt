[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.

Matthew Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats on another nice quarter. So maybe 2 parts. Mike, could you elaborate on drivers of the same-store sales acceleration that you saw in October, speak to comp trends that you've seen in November that support the 4% to 6% fourth quarter comp guide? And then, Stewart, could you just help break down gross margin expansion opportunities in the fourth quarter and how best to think about gross margin puts and takes maybe at a high level for next year?

Michael Creedon
CEO & Director

Yes. Sure, Matt. As we looked at how the quarter unfolded, the Halloween was just a great finish to the quarter. It did come as we see in times like this, people buying for need and a little closer to need. So it came a little later, but it came incredibly powerfully, and it came with a record number.

If you go back, Easter performed that way, a great Easter, a great Halloween. And our setup for Thanksgiving and Christmas is just fantastic. So we really look at what we've done with multi-price and how the assortment has gotten better and our customer across all incomes is really resonating with that and providing just fantastic seasons for us. So we feel really good about our guide on the 4% to 6%.

Stewart Glendinning
Chief Financial Officer

Matt, let me pick up on the gross margin for the fourth quarter and then just talk a little bit about next year. So first of all, as we think about the fourth quarter, the same kind of levers that you saw in the third quarter, we detailed some of that in our supplementary materials as well as in my prepared remarks are going to be drivers in the fourth quarter.

You will see a very powerful fourth quarter on the back of those drivers. If you look to next year and just think about next year, freight is a benefit certainly in the fourth quarter, it came through in the third quarter. As you look to next year, both freight and markdowns are the areas that we'll be watching. If you think about how we operate our business, we buy to a margin. And so when we set up our goal for next year, we shared with you that we said we would be equivalent to this year's margin, plus or minus 50 basis points, and that's the place that we're targeting.

There may be continued benefit in freight as we move into next year. There is some belief that perhaps on the freight side, we'll see a tightening of capacity later in the year, and we are watching the potential shortage of drivers. But I understand that the reason I bring up the targeted gross margin is because we use those 5 merchant levers to achieve that margin. So I think the margin you can take to the bank for next year.

The second piece is to refer back to the Investor Day materials that we had. And in our fourth -- in our recent Investor Day, we shared with you an algorithm that said we would achieve high teens improvement next year. That's on the basis of that same gross margin achievement and based on some of the discrete items that we're expecting to see in the coming years. So we're set up well for next year, and I think that probably gives you the main drivers.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.

Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

It's on traffic. And obviously, this was the first decline in traffic that Dollar Tree has experienced in a while. To what degree is that as a result of some of the legacy households pushing back on the price increases that have been taken in the last couple of quarters?

And if that's the case, does that give you any pause on your ability to achieve this high teens EPS growth next year in light of the prospect that you might have to make some investments in order to recapture those households that are just dissatisfied with the pricing changes?

Michael Creedon
CEO & Director

Yes, Michael, we really see traffic as a mix between some internal activity, namely the restickering and some broader retail trends. We don't see it as a pushback from our customer. And if you look at our performance in the quarter, we had great growth across all income cohorts, and our core customer really had our highest comp. So we look at it and say we saw the traffic decelerate in that August, September time frame. That was the peak of our restickering.

Those red stickers that was the peak distraction for us and then it was good to see traffic strengthen towards the end of the quarter, really on the backs of that Halloween and that great strength in Halloween.

So we believe there was some broad-based retail traffic decel around back-to-school, some of the sticker shock around back-to-school. But as we got into the real core of what Dollar Tree does and does, we think, better than anyone, we saw the strength in our Halloween, and we're very excited about what Thanksgiving and Christmas and all the seasons can do for us.

Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Partners.

John Heinbockel
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Mike, 2 quick ones. When you think about traffic or divergence between traffic and units, so sort of is the idea, traffic will be strong, units maybe to a lesser degree because you're basically trading people into higher price point items. Talk about that divergence in your mind. And then secondly, if the units are going to grow at a slower pace, how do you think about space allocation and replanogramming the stores over maybe the intermediate to longer term?

Michael Creedon
CEO & Director

First of all, thanks. We'll always follow our customer on that. We believe that the customer is resonating incredibly well with multi-price. We're hearing that in the surveys we're doing. We're seeing it in how our customers are performing in the store and that real strength in the comp of that core customer. So yes, when we look at the store, when we take multi-price, we'll take away sections of $1.25.

And so your units will naturally decline there as you take that space and make that space more productive. So we do see some of that. But we believe the proof point we have from break the dollar was that you took up the price of the whole store. There were elements of the store that just didn't work, and our merchant team took the next buying cycles to really recover that.

What we've seen here in this multi-price evolution and some of the restickering we did based on the inflationary cost environment is that the units have performed better, the traffic has performed better, and we're confident that we can continue to drive that value in our product across these price points and continue to give the customer exactly what they need. So we see that coming together very well for us, and we'll respond to the customer and their trends with how we set up the store.

Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.

Edward Kelly
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to ask you about the mix of multi-price as you think about next year. Just looking out, it does seem like you'll have more conversions. I would imagine you're still doing more merchandising around improving the multi-price mix. So how do you think the stores look from the standpoint of the multi-price offering as we think about next year? And then how does that play into the way that you are thinking about driving comp next year in terms of traffic versus ticket?

Michael Creedon
CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Ed. I mean I really want to start with saying 85% of the store is still $2 or less. So we're still early in this multi-price game. And when you look at what the seasons have done, we're going to continue to benefit in those seasons from the multi-price assortment. And we're really looking at everyday essentials and where we can benefit in the assortment there and the shift towards multi-price. Where it ultimately goes, our customers will respond to us and we'll respond to them in terms of building it out.

But I know it's higher than where we are today, and it's something that we believe sets up a multiyear run where we're able to respond to our customers, wow them with new discovery and not just at the seasons, but new discovery every day because multi-price contains something on a wow table for us or on an end cap that shows them something they couldn't believe they could get at that price, even though it's a price higher than $2. So we're delivering the everyday value with the majority of the stores still at that $2 or less, and we're wowing the customer in what we bring into the multi-price assortment.

Our next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi.

Paul Lejuez
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Curious if you could talk about Thanksgiving weekend and what you saw from a traffic versus ticket perspective. It sounded like you saw a pickup in traffic around the Halloween period. Curious what you saw Thanksgiving week and weekend.

And then that 85% number, I think you're talking in terms of units, in terms of the percent of the store that's still $2 and below. What percent of sales would we -- should we think about being above that $2 level? And how does it split between discretionary and consumables?

Michael Creedon
CEO & Director

Yes, Paul, let me clear up the first one. So first of all, it's sales dollars that are at the 85% of the stores $2 left. That is on sales dollars. As we look at how the quarter has started, I said in my prepared remarks, we're really pleased. We look at the strength of the seasons, the Thanksgiving, the setup for Christmas, what we've seen so far in Christmas. So we feel really good about the guide for the fourth quarter. We've got one period in, and we're feeling really good about where we sit.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.

Rupesh Parikh
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

I also have a 2-part one. So just on the elasticity front, just curious on the categories you took pricing related tariff trip and price increases. Just curious how that played out. And then if we do get tariff relief, how do you guys approach that, whether passing on those savings or letting it flow to the bottom line?

Michael Creedon
CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Rupesh. I mean the elasticity has really -- it's come in as we've modeled it. It's very manageable. It's really offset by the mix we see in the multi-price. But most importantly, the value perception is intact. Our customers responding across all income cohorts, core customers, new customers, the 60% of the new $3 million that have come in, making more than $100,000. So we believe that the elasticity is very manageable.

And then I do think it's important to go back to that break the dollar moment, what we saw there, it's a proof point. You can go back and look, see what happened with traffic. And now our performance, we believe, and what we're seeing in our numbers is better than that and gives us the confidence in the path we're on, on this.

As for the tariffs, I know it's been a lot in the news. We have, I think, one of the very best global sourcing teams in the business. They are all over this. They've got great partners watching this. We'll see how it unfolds with the Supreme Court, and we'll take action from there.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.

Uriel Zachary Abraham
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

This is Zach on for Simeon. Just a couple from our end. Back to the traffic question, is there a way you could compare your frequent and most loyal customers to those who are more episodic? And would you say there's a similar deceleration in traffic trends between both of those groups? Or is there a gap in the trend?

Michael Creedon
CEO & Director

Yes. When we break it down, we really look at more our sales across all those income cohorts. It's really important to us to make sure that as we know multi-price skews and attracts more towards higher income that we are committed to the base of our business, which is that core customer, that customer that makes around $60,000 a year.

And we were particularly pleased with how our comps performed at that core customer. They had our highest comps in that customer. And so we think that our customer, whether you're new to Dollar Tree or you shop us several times a month, that you're finding what you need as you seek -- if you seek out affordability, you're finding exactly what you need at Dollar Tree.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist.

Scot Ciccarelli
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Scott Ciccarelli. I think we all understand that there was some internal disruption as you resticker product. But with the negative traffic this quarter and the expectation to keep expanding MPP, should we just expect 4Q and next year to have a similar mix of traffic and ticket that we saw in 3Q? In other words, it's all the comp is primarily driven by ticket.

Michael Creedon
CEO & Director

Yes. Scott, it's hard to say. We can go back and we know what we saw and break the dollar. You saw the multiple quarters and how the traffic performed there. We believe this time around, we were much more strategic. I mean back then, the only choice was raising everything to $1.25.

And as I've mentioned, you had a healthy percentage of the store that just didn't work at that new level and the merchant team had to go over several buying cycles and reengineer product and renegotiate and get product that did work, and you saw what happened with traffic recovery.

This time, we were much more strategic in how we took that. We really feel that we have found the right value places to take price. And our customers responded. If you look at the value we took in Halloween or in Christmas, I mean, our customers responded incredibly well to that move. So I look at it and say, I think we were more strategic this time or we at least had a more strategic opportunity available to us this time, and we'll see how the traffic plays out.

Stewart Glendinning
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And maybe one other thing, just to supplement, I think if you go back to the investor materials we laid out, I mean, that entire strategy is set up to drive higher sales in stores via productivity on the shelves, via the way we intend to market to customers and based on the way we intend to run better stores. I think that entire setup really is organized to enhance the traffic and the ticket flow.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore.

Michael Montani
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I was going to ask if you could share what the average selling price was in 3Q versus this time a year ago. And then curious if you think that you'd be able to get that level of price increase again in 2026 to drive comp.

Michael Creedon
CEO & Director

Yes. Our AUR right now right about $1.50. When you look at that value over time, it's pretty remarkable considering what this company has done, what other prices have done. So we look at it and say, our customer is going to tell us with their comps, with their wallets that we're hitting the right points in terms of value, convenience and discovery.

One of the things that we really turn to is that expanded more relevant assortment. So yes, it comes at a higher ticket, but it's still an incredible wow for the customer. It fits their occasion, the purpose for their trip and whether it's a great pack size for them that helps them or just an item that helps them celebrate and they love it. So we feel that while the AUR moves up, it does so lock squarely into that value play for the customer.

Stewart Glendinning
Chief Financial Officer

Keep in mind one other item is that, obviously, as our multi-price penetration increases, so that will also move AUR, that is not price dependent. And I think if you look at the supplementary materials and you look at how well the multi-price worked in Halloween this year, it will give you a sense for the kind of benefit we might see going forward as we drive that multi-price harder.

Our next question comes from the line of Zhihan Ma with Bernstein.

Zhihan Ma
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Just one quick clarification on corporate expenses. Did it come in a bit better than your prior expectations? If you can provide a bit more color there, that would be really helpful. And then a quick one on next year. Given the trade-in you have seen from middle to higher income consumers, what does the tax refund, the incremental tax refund next year do to middle to high-income consumers shopping behaviors in your mind?

Stewart Glendinning
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, I'll pick up on the first part, Stewart here. The SG&A did come in better than we expected as we get ready to set ourselves up for next year and achieve some of the aggressive savings targets we've set up, we've been squeezing down on SG&A. Some of those savings came in a little bit faster than we had expected.

Michael Creedon
CEO & Director

Yes. And then I'll take the second one. I look at the tax refunds of the OB3, Big Beautiful Bill. Would you offer the best value in retail, you benefit when people have more money in their wallet. And Dollar Tree has the best value retail has, and we think we'll benefit as they get more money in their pocket.

Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.

Kelly Bania
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

I wanted to ask about the consumables, the market share trends there from a unit perspective. They seemed quite strong in the first half, but really shifted in the third quarter here. I was just curious if you had any explanation of what you think is happening there? Is that attributable to the sticker -- the restickering impact? Or any other color on the market share trends there?

Michael Creedon
CEO & Director

Yes, Kelly, the red dots is kind of how I'll answer that. It really peaked for us in this Q3. It was the mass distraction. I will tell you, though, as we've seen trends from our customer post that, we track via customer surveys, via scrapes of website and star ratings and all that, the sentiment of our customer that really peaked negative in that August, September has improved every week.

So the fewer mentions of pricing, more positivity, less negativity, we've been watching that. And every week, that's gotten better. So we don't love that we had to create that environment for our customer. It was a necessary evil to continue to deliver for them and give them product at a value.

But it is what it is, and it's behind us now. The red stickering is basically done. You get a little bit as you take some pack away, but it's basically done. The distraction is behind us and our stores and customers are responding very favorably.

Our next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.

Joseph Feldman
Telsey Advisory Group LLC

When you talked about the -- that higher income consumer trying to get them to visit more often with more frequency. I'm just wondering how you guys plan to go about that? Maybe is it more stimulus from a marketing standpoint? Or I don't know what other methods that you might be thinking of, but how do you get them to come more frequently?

Michael Creedon
CEO & Director

Yes. We love that this customer is finding us. We want to create a very sticky relationship with them. And we believe it is the more relevant assortment. So continuing to wow them each season that they come up and for their everyday essentials with items they just can't believe they found. Remember, you don't come into Dollar Tree with a list and you head down and I have to get this.

You come in with your head moving around, looking at all the things that are wowing you. So that relevant assortment creates a sticky relationship, and then there is nothing more important than running better stores. Our store standards are on the move up, and we believe that as we continue to improve the in-store experience, those customers are going to want to come more and more often.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America.

Robert Ohmes
BofA Securities, Research Division

I wanted to follow up on the last question. Just the -- it's impressive how you guys are gaining all the new customers and the info you gave us on that. Just help me understand gaining all these new customers at all these income cohorts versus negative traffic.

Like how does that happen? Is somebody -- are there cohorts dropping out or coming a lot less frequently and that's offsetting all these new customers that you guys have gotten to come to the stores? Maybe a little more color on like what's happening there.

Michael Creedon
CEO & Director

Yes, Robby, it's really a question of frequency. So you're driving new customers to the store, which is fantastic. I mean, 3 million new households. Yes, they're skewing a bit higher income, but the strength of our business is still in that core customer, their purchase frequency, their comp dollars.

We believe that these new customers come in, we can increase their trip frequency, too when they find better run stores and they find an assortment that keeps them coming back. So right now, they're coming in because of a Halloween or they're coming in for a great season and then what they find in the store when they're there in health and beauty and in everyday essentials, that's what keeps them coming back.

If you look at Dollar Tree compared to some of the folks we aspire to be, the difference is not in our ticket. The difference is in trip frequency. We believe we've got an opportunity to unlock increased trip frequency with these great newer trade-in customers.

Our next question comes from the line of Bobby Griffin with Raymond James.

Robert Griffin
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Just curious if you can expand a little bit more on shrink and where you are in that journey of bending that line item. And then I don't think it was discussed at the Investor Day, but what is embedded in the multiyear outlook for shrink? Is that elevated rate versus pre-COVID? Or is it a return to 2019 rates?

Michael Creedon
CEO & Director

Yes. I'll start with that with the focus we have. We learned a lot about shrink from Family Dollar. Family Dollar has a higher shrink threshold, if you will. And we were able to bend the curve over there. And so we've really reorganized how we're addressing shrink at Dollar Tree.

It's not as simple for us as it is other. We can't just go rip out a bunch of self-checkouts and improve our shrink. We don't have self-checkout in any large capacity. So for us, it has to be leveraging training of our people, leveraging technology to address shrink over time. And then in terms of how it builds, Stewart?

Stewart Glendinning
Chief Financial Officer

So Bobby, Stewart, we have built in some improvement in shrink as we move forward. I mean we've made these changes to people and process. We're investing money in our -- in our asset protection, and we expect that to bend the trend. So that is built into the forward expectations.

Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.

Charles Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

I have just a question on the SG&A line. In Slide 9, you talk about the unit trend going from 100 to 89. So there's a clear benefit from running less units through the store on freight and handling expenses. But when we look at the core SG&A line, can we unpack the 160 basis point increase in SG&A? And then also looking ahead to the fourth quarter, how are you thinking about the complexion of both gross margins and SG&A in the last quarter of the year?

Stewart Glendinning
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So Chuck, Stewart. When you really look at SG&A in total, the big driver for SG&A increases is really in store payroll in that whole space. We do have some increases, as we said before, both in D&A based on store investments and also in general liability claims. Those are probably the big areas to think about. If I unpack the store payroll for you a little bit, earlier in the year, we commented on the fact that first, we were faced with some rate increases.

Those -- a number of those were driven by state minimum wage increases. And second, we had decided at the beginning of this year that we would put some more hours back into the stores because we felt that if we invested some hours in stores, we could drive a better comp. And certainly, we set that out as an aggressive goal for the year, 3% to 5% comp, and we're obviously at the top end of that.

And the last piece, of course, is the tariff-related stickering activities, which is a pretty substantial add. So if you think about the increase in payroll, which, again, the biggest driver of the SG&A, it was about 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. 1/3 was the rate, 1/3 was the increased investment in hours and 1/3 was stickering.

Let me come back now to your unit point because I want to look forward to next year. If you're thinking about next year, the stickering is sort of largely gone. So that piece is not going to be pushing on our P&L. In fact, that's a benefit. The rate increases, we believe that rate is going to start to moderate, and that's going to help us next year. And then the last piece on the hours side, actually on the hours side is exactly the point you've just made.

The success of multi-price, in fact, allows us to move fewer units through the store, and that will give us the flexibility to decide do we take the units -- do we take the hours down? Do we invest some more hours in running the stores better? But I think it puts us in a better position overall. Hopefully, that gives you a good flavor for your question.
