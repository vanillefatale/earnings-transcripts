[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.

Jeffrey Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

I guess two for me, one longer term and one shorter term. Bill, just back to your Slide 6, as you said, all these things are going on to varying degrees simultaneously. But the pivot to priority verticals sort of jumps out to me, obviously, not the first time we've heard that. But I just wonder if you could put into context how much of that pivot is addition by subtraction versus investment focus growing and bulking up the areas that you view as the priority. And maybe what percent of your current revenue base or business base would you say is in that priority bucket?

William Brown
CEO & Chairman

So Jeff, great question. So we've been talking about our priority verticals going back a year, actually to February of last year. It's a little bit north of 60%, it's growing, frankly, because of the investments we're making. And I put it in two pieces. One, we spent the last 1.5 years focusing a lot of our internal investment dollars on the priority verticals. And now probably 80% of what we spend on R&D is aligned to NPI in the priority verticals. And of course, they are defined as ones that are growing faster where we have good margin potential as well in the business where technology brings differentiation and right to win. And that's been the pivot in the organization.

Over time, as we think about what the portfolio is going to look like for us to get to a much better sustainable organic growth rate for the overall company, we've got to structurally adjust the portfolio, which means some pieces coming out and we've been talking about some of those pieces. We've said before, about 10% of our company would be in places that are more commodity like, and we'll probably -- we'll think about what we want to do with those businesses over time. But as we do that, we'll be pivoting both organically as well as inorganically towards those priority verticals which is the nature of that chart. It shows that that's an evolution over time. And again, it's not necessarily sequential, but that's kind of the overall flow how we think about creating value here at 3M.

Jeffrey Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Yes. And then just on the very near term, the flat view on U.S. IPI, it's kind of a tough slog out there, right? But your industrial businesses do seem to be performing well, right? Abrasives and some of the adhesives, electrical businesses. So I guess there's some outgrowth there. But I guess just the nature of my question is just a little more color on how you see the year kind of starting out, Anurag gave a little bit of color, but did we start soft here in January? And do you see things sort of kind of picking up off a low base here as we exited the year?

William Brown
CEO & Chairman

Yes. So last year, I mean we -- the exit rate was pretty solid actually, across the industrial businesses. And we -- Anurag in his comments talked about the acceleration from about 2% to 3.6% across TEBG and SIBG as we went first half into the second half. Yes, IPI is softening, both in the U.S. as well as in China, those are important markets for us, certainly. But we do expect our overall industrial businesses to remain pretty solid. I pointed out a couple of watch areas. One is in auto builds. Auto builds were around 3.8% last year, a little weaker in Q4. A lot of it was China but overall, it will be -- says right now, down 0.3% as much as you can believe the numbers and not so good across the -- all of the regions. So that auto was a little bit softer. We have to watch that.

Consumer electronics is looking a little bit more flattish in terms of the overall macro forecast. Of course, we believe in our business, electronics will continue to grow. We still see that to be overall electronics up mid-single digits for the year. Of course, we are watching very carefully, which happened -- what happens in the U.S. consumer market. Right now, it feels subdued. We had a very good December, although Q4 came in down 2.2%. So it dropped the year to be negative for Consumer, but December, we typically see the third month pretty good, but it was up double digits over the prior year in December. And early in January, again, it's early this year, we're looking okay. So that's sort of the landscape, but I do see that even though IPI is coming down, our commercial excellence initiatives, our NPI initiatives, it's going to allow us to continue to outperform that macro, and we expect that to accelerate in '26 from what we experienced in '25.

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.

Scott Davis
Melius Research LLC

I guess, I don't think you mentioned inventory levels, customer inventory levels in the prepared remarks. And just as we exited the 2025, where -- what's your sense of where your customer inventory levels were or are, I guess, now point in reference, pre-COVID, post -- the new normal versus pre-COVID? Just a little color around that, I think, would be helpful.

William Brown
CEO & Chairman

Sure. Good question. So on the industrial channel, it's pretty normalized, it's in the sort of 60-day range, a little bit more than that. But as we would expect it to be, as we were selling out in Q4, we do watch POS out of our channel partners, and they were selling through. So even though we had good sales into the channel, we also saw good sales out of the channel. So pretty good actually on the industrial side, that's good.

On the Consumer side, on the CBG side, it was a little bit elevated early in the quarter, but we had very strong growth in December and inventory started to come down and normalize, still a little bit elevated as we exited the year, but not as concerning as we were sort of at the beginning of the quarter. So overall, industrial, pretty good, Consumer getting normalized as we speak.

Scott Davis
Melius Research LLC

Okay. Fair enough. And then, guys, what is the pricing strategy right now? I mean it kind of -- when just listening to the prepared remarks, it sounds like new products is where you lean in on price or at least try to get a positive mix shift there. But is there also a pricing strategy around getting an annual bump up perhaps that maybe you didn't get historically, but going out with price increases on, on January 1, particularly where you're going through distribution?

William Brown
CEO & Chairman

So yes, good question. So for the year, we had expected to be about 70 basis points last year, stepping up first half, second half as we are covering some of the tariff headwind. We saw that in the third quarter. And the fourth quarter was a little bit lighter because of the consumer market and the promos and discounts that we provided there to stimulate that business. So overall, we were little lighter on pricing last year than we had expected, but still very solid.

The place where we get pricing, generally speaking, is in SIBG, and that was solid, that remains strong. We continue to see good pricing movement here going into 2026. We expect it will be about 80 basis points more or less in 2026. A lot of it is SIBG.

There's a couple of threads here. One is we do continue to cover material cost inflation. Two, we continue to tighten down our pricing governance, making sure across all of the industrial businesses that when we give pricing discounts, we get the volume we'd expect in giving those discounts. And then third, as you pointed out, Scott, is the pricing we should expect to get when we're launching new products. This is an area of opportunity for us over the medium and longer term. I think we're okay on this, but we could be a lot better. There's pockets where we are very thoughtful in pricing to value, but I would not say that today that that's over all of the NPI we're launching, and I think it's a long-term opportunity for the company.

Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.

Julian Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Maybe first off, I just wanted to understand the degree to which if any, there was a back-end loading in the guide. It seems like you're expecting about 6% EPS growth year-on-year in the first half, so not that different from the full year. Just wanted to check that and how you're starting out in the first quarter. Should we expect the Consumer business to still be down, for example, and then that picks up steam through the year?

Anurag Maheshwari
CFO & Executive VP

Thanks, Julian. Anurag here. So I would say in terms of EPS growth, we expect the first half and second half to be equal. So as I said in my prepared comments, the EPS will be equal between the first and second half, which implies similar growth rate as well. And if you look at what I said is in the SIBG, TEBG, given the exit rate, we do expect revenue to be over 3% in the first quarter. CBG is an area we'll watch out. And you'll probably see that part of the revenue go through the course of the year, but materially do not expect the rate of growth to be significantly different between the first half and the second half.

And if I look at productivity as well, it's pretty even loaded across the 4 quarters. So I think as we sit here today, we feel that it's a fairly even loaded quarterly cadence for both revenue as well as EPS.

Julian Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

That's very helpful. And then just my follow-up would be around that sort of interplay, and it's been touched on a couple of times, but between the macro and the self-help initiatives. So when we're thinking about the guidance for a deceleration in IPI in the U.S. this year, but an acceleration somewhat in 3M's own organic growth rate, it is our impression that that's really all self-help initiatives that you mentioned and the outgrowth or the acceleration in the second half of 2025. Is your impression that, that was all self-help driven as well with nothing from the macro? Just to understand how much you're sort of putting on your own shoulders versus relying on the external environment for this year?

William Brown
CEO & Chairman

So Julian, thanks for the question. Let me maybe frame it by just talking about a little more granularity, the $1 billion over macro. We talked about over -- at the Investor Day, over the next 3 years and Anurag mentioned, in 2025, our growth came in at 2.1%. We look at the overall macro to be around 1.5%. That's IPI, GDP, with some sectors that were a bit weaker, it is where we see it. So we saw ourselves with about 60 basis points of outperformance versus the macro. And if you just run the math, that gives you about $150 million. So a little bit better than we had expected to be $100 million over macro last year. And the majority of that, probably 75% of it or more was commercial excellence. Less of that was new product introductions, but we did say that, that would start to even out in an NPI or innovation would take over in that third year.

And that's, in fact, what we're seeing in 2026. So we're guiding here at 3%. We expect the macro in 2026 to be a little bit better at 1.5%, maybe 1.7% range, something like that. So our outperformance this year versus the macro is more like $300 million or more. And that's roughly half and half between NPI and commercial excellence.

So that's how we see this playing out. And yes, the back half of last year did show that. We did outperform the macro. A lot of it was, as you phrased, Julian, was carrying it on our shoulders and we expect to see more of that coming into 2026. We're launching more projects, which is very good. We're getting a lot more granular tracking the incremental revenue coming from Class 3s, 4s and 5s, and as we look out into next year, we're pretty confident that those are going to start to move the needle for the company, which is why we feel good about outgrowing the macro here in '26.

Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo.

Joseph O'Dea
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to start on footprint optimization. If you can give a little color between factories and distribution centers, how you're thinking about targets for footprint reduction or consolidation in 2026, both in terms of kind of number of facilities and as well as op profit impact? And then any color around segments and regions where we would see the biggest impact there?

William Brown
CEO & Chairman

So look, it's all part of our broader transformation agenda. We're just starting on that as we speak. We did see some announcements at the back end of last year. We announced one small facility last week in our network. We ended the year around about 108 factories. We have several -- about 7 coming out with the sale of precision grinding and finishing. So call it about 100 factories. That will come down over time, I can't size it for you today. We will be making some investments in '26 to restructure that network. But keep in mind, these things are 3-, 4-, 5-year payback. So we'll start on it, accelerate into '26, accelerate in '27. But this is really about building that margin runway to grow beyond 25% in '27 in terms of operating margin.

So we will consolidate this network. It will be factories and distribution centers. We're making some progress on DCs as well. But I won't be able to size it for you today in terms of the specific numbers, but that's the trajectory we're on here.

Joseph O'Dea
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And then just wanted to touch a little bit more on Consumer. If you could elaborate on kind of what you tracked over the course of the quarter, kind of early into this year, sort of a step down in demand trends versus what maybe it was a little bit more transitory and just kind of how that's pacing? And then separately, just with the focus on memory chips out there, I think you said consumer electronics, you expect it to be up mid-single digits, but any impact you're seeing in the markets tied to that?

William Brown
CEO & Chairman

So on the consumer market, as I mentioned earlier, we -- as we entered -- first of all, for the first 9 months of the year, we were about 30 basis points of growth in each quarter, which was pretty consistent, and that was above what we saw the macro. It was a good time to return to growth. We feel very positive about that. And we had expected that we would see the similar trajectory going into the fourth quarter. That didn't happen. We saw October and November being a little bit light. Sell-through, the channel was a bit light, POS was light. So inventory started to come up a little bit. We started to see that reverse a little bit in December. So December, orders were okay, growth was double digit over the prior year December. The holiday season was a little bit muted, I would say.

So overall, for Q4, we came in at down 2.2%. And as I said, as we turn the corner into January, it's very, very early. We're only a couple of weeks in. We're trending as we would expect it to be. So I can't really comment too much about that. We'll say more over time. But that's the consumer. Again, I would just characterize it as being relatively soft, bumping around flattish as we ended the fourth quarter.

So on electronics, overall, we have -- so it's consumer electronics business, we have -- we provide adhesives, we provide films into that area for foldable devices, for de-bondable devices, a lot of NPI going into that space. We are focusing on growing our position in the mainstream market. 3M as a whole, in consumer electronics, is more like 80-20 or 70-30 premium to mainstream and the market is the opposite of that. We do see an opportunity to grow and penetrate mainstream. Some of that is in China, and we're making good progress. So a lot of the NPI that we're launching, we are penetrating into a lot of China OEMs and Asia OEMs in that mainstream market. And I think we're starting to gain some share there. So that's why we see that business for us when we add in semiconductors, data center, all electronics to be up mid-single digits here coming into 2026, similar to what we saw last year.

Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.

C. Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just on that electronics point. So the reported revenues were down sequentially and also year-over-year. Is there -- do we just adjust that back to get to that mid-single-digit for the fourth quarter? I think you said it was strong, but what was kind of the organic rate of growth? It's tough to tell from the subsegment disclosure.

William Brown
CEO & Chairman

Yes. It was in the mid-single digits. What we're looking at in the tables is with PFAS, and we exclude the PFAS out of the results. So when you exclude that, it's mid-single digits.

C. Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then when you're expanding into this mainstream area, is there any kind of dilutive impact to margins at all? Or are you kind of make up for it on the other end by being more efficient with some of the initiatives you're working on?

William Brown
CEO & Chairman

No, we're not seeing it being margin dilutive as we innovate here, develop products, design to cost, it's an important push that the team is making is designing more cost-effective product. Now we're not seeing any margin degradation. And so far, it's been good. It's early, but it's the push we're making. And again, a lot of NPI in that space.

C. Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Sorry, one more, just for this year, the $500 million in, I guess, litigation costs in '25. How do you expect that to trend in -- that adjustment to trend in '26?

William Brown
CEO & Chairman

It's probably going to be in line with that. I can't really tell you if it's going to be up or down. I mean it depends on what happens in the overall docket, but I would expect it to be pretty similar to that.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.

Andrew Obin
BofA Securities, Research Division

So on SIBG growth in '26, I think last quarter, you had the Slide 5 that showed SIBG growth correlation to improving OTIF, new product introduction. And you sort of can see in the fourth quarter on a 2-year stack, clearly, there is more momentum. So given that comps in the first half are going to be easier than in the second half, but at the same time, we have seemingly good momentum with self-help, should we see first half stronger growth than second half? Or should the growth be fairly steady year-over-year throughout the year?

William Brown
CEO & Chairman

So Andrew, it's a very, very good question. We do see really good momentum in SIBG as it went from the first half to the second half. And I could see where you're going, and I'll pass that message on to Chris, I'm sure he's listening as well. The reality is there's good momentum, really good progress on commercial excellence. We're launching more projects there. The only caveat is, as I talked about earlier, we do see U.S. IPI a little bit softer. We know the roofing business experienced a trough really in Q4. It was weaker than we'd expect -- quite a bit weaker than we had expected. And that's a piece of the SIBG business. I'd expect that weakness will drag into the front half of this year. So there's going to be some offsets. But yes, I mean, largely, I think you're heading in the right direction. I think SIBG is performing really well. We'd expect to continue that trend here in 2026.

Andrew Obin
BofA Securities, Research Division

And just a follow-up on electronics. You sort of talked about expanding into mainstream and this sort of echoes strategy from the days of George Buckley, the Pyramid Strategy. Is this just the focus on consumer electronics? Or are you thinking of sort of tweaking it and implementing it beyond consumer electronics the sort of mainstream strategy?

William Brown
CEO & Chairman

No, it's -- I'm speaking today basically on consumer electronics. And I think you've commented before that this strategy was embarked upon in the past. Look, this has to be a very thoughtful way of going at this. We have to make sure that all of our infrastructure, our designs, our sourcing, how we manufacture, how we ship, how we price, all is geared towards going after that segment, which is quite big, but making sure we do it profitably. So it's a bit of a business model shift as well.

So I draw you back to what we're trying to do in our transformation agenda. A lot of this business model shift is shifting our cost structure, both G&A as well as on the factory side. And if we do that and we bring that cost out, that does allow us to lower the water level of our cost and attack these interesting and growing segments at profit rates that we have today. So that's where we're going. We're pushing ahead in consumer electronics. Could it go beyond that? We'll see. But right now, the comments are specific to consumer electronics.

Andrew Obin
BofA Securities, Research Division

Nothing wrong with that strategy. Your stock outperformed under George Buckley.

William Brown
CEO & Chairman

Yes.

Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with UBS.

Amit Mehrotra
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Anurag, I guess I wanted to just ask about incremental margins for this year. The implied is sort of in the low 40%, which is not that much above the 30% to 40% kind of core organic on the growth. So I'm just kind of curious what the productivity assumption is, what the offsets are from stranded costs? Maybe I'm double counting, maybe some of that's already included in the 30%, 40%, but if you can unpack that for us, I think that would be helpful. And then on the first quarter, specifically, I know you said high single digits, not to be nitpicky, but are we kind of above $2 per share in 1Q, like any finer point would be helpful.

Anurag Maheshwari
CFO & Executive VP

Okay, great. Thanks for the question, Amit. Just firstly, if you look at both volume and productivity in 2026, it's going to be higher than what it was in '25. So in '25, between volume and productivity, we had about $750 million of operating income increase. And that was a 2.1% organic revenue growth. With 3% growth, the $200 million of volume will now become closer to $250 million and productivity actually goes up from $550 million to about $600 million. So overall, we're going to see about $125 million to $150 million increase between volume and productivity in '26.

And the productivity is going up on three real buckets around there. First is on supply chain. We expect half of that to come out of supply chain, which is continued cost of poor quality, bringing it down, procurement, managing a 4-wall spend in the factory and logistics. There's about $150 million of indirect expenses. We did a good job in '25. We'll continue to do that in '26. And another $150 million in G&A efficiency as we look at our processes of optimization and so on.

So overall, I would say that the incrementals between volume -- between productivity and the volume growth is going to be higher. What's offsetting it in '26 is -- or the $0.5 billion, which is being offset in '26, one is a pickup in investments. Last year, we did $185 million. We're going to do an incremental $225 million this year. The stranded cost goes up from $100 million last year to $150 million this year. So I would say those are probably the two biggest buckets, which -- and obviously, we have half a year of tariff as well, which is $140 million. So you put these three together, that's $0.5 billion of it. Obviously, as we go into '27, a couple of them will not recur, but the incrementals overall are pretty good for '26.

Now on your first quarter, it is a very specific question that you're asking me. What I would say is that as I spoke about volume and productivity, I said about $875 million to $900 million for the year. The first quarter was almost 25% of that, right? So if you kind of run the numbers through, and there will be a little bit of FX favorability in the first quarter given where we were last year, you run all of that through, it will be high single-digit EPS growth.

Amit Mehrotra
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. And then just maybe a longer-term question for Bill. You've obviously given us a lot of metrics, whether it's OTIF or OEE. And I'm kind of intrigued by this move to this design to cost approach in the R&D function. NPI is helpful, but it doesn't really capture kind of how the addressable market is changing based on the incremental NPI side. I'd be curious, one, how do you hold the R&D function kind of accountable to this cultural shift? And what can you kind of share with us in terms of the NPI coming out, how effective that is in going after the 80% of the market that you're kind of not there at the moment?

William Brown
CEO & Chairman

So Amit, good question. I'll just hit it briefly. I think there's two pieces of it. One is the value engineering efforts that we are stepping up dramatically this year on to take cost out of products that are on the market today, which does require additional engineering work, there's qualification work, there's things that have to happen, generally speaking, to get those initiatives taking hold. We also that -- we have to drive that back into the overall design mindset and thinking of cost as we start developing products. And that's the push we're making is thinking about it early in the design process, which is the best time to be thinking about that.

How we hold people accountable in R&D or anywhere through the company, product leaders, general managers, even me, is the quality of the business cases and making sure that the business cases are developed rigorously from the ground up with a good sense of what the costs happen to be, and you start with the design to cause mentality and holding people accountable to the results of what we're investing in based on these business cases where we're going to be pushing the company more this year.

Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.

Nicole DeBlase
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Just wanted to circle back on China. I think you guys have embedded 4% IPI growth in '26, and that compares to like 6% in '25. I know '25 was like a pretty good year for you guys in China. So you could just elaborate a little bit on what you're seeing in the region and where that decel is coming from for next year?

William Brown
CEO & Chairman

So thanks for the question. Yes, China actually had a very good year for us, a good couple of years. In '24, they're up double digits. Last year, they were up mid-single digits. It was a little bit lighter in Q4, but only because of as Anurag had mentioned in his prepared remarks, the shift out of China smartphone production, when you exclude that, the market -- the China business for us remains mid-single digits. And as we turn the corner to this year, yes, the macro is softening a little bit, is what we're expecting. I think 2 points down year-over-year on IPI, at least as we see it today and the forecast see it again, this could go in lots of different ways. But we see that market to be more low to mid-single digits this year, still growing, maybe not as robustly as we saw last year, but still low to mid-single digits.

The bottom line is we run China a little bit differently in the company just like we do in India, it's a hybrid model. So we have global business groups and a really strong, dedicated, driven local team. We're driving a lot of localization of R&D, localization of sourcing.

We're attacking the market. We've got 6 factories there, 5,000 people. And it's -- and we've got people lined up to really drive that business. And I think we are performing well. And I would say we're outperforming. And I expect the same thing here in '26.

Nicole DeBlase
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Bill, that's helpful. And then obviously, had quite a bit of new noise from a tariff perspective over the weekend. So can you just confirm the tariff headwind that you guys are embedding in 2026 doesn't include any of this potentially new tariffs from Europe? And have you guys tried to quantify what that could mean for your business if they are enacted?

William Brown
CEO & Chairman

So Nicole, great question. So what we're embedding in our guidance is the carryover effect of the $0.20 of gross impact that we saw last year. That's in -- and Anurag mentioned, that's mostly in the first half of this year. That's what's in the guidance because that's what's in law. That's what's in practice today and we're moving.

Now the pieces that at least the President is now talking about relative to Greenland and new different tariffs on Europe, it's about 8 countries, they're talking about 10% in February, another 25% midyear, or something like that. For us, the trade flows between U.S. and Europe is around $1 billion. We're a net exporter. So we export $700 million into Europe. We import back about $250 million. If you just run the numbers at 10% and then growing up to 25%, you can get to something in the order of $60 million, $70 million. But that's over the course of the year, we'll see some of that going in inventory. We'll see some of that dragging into 2027. So if that plays out exactly as we expect, the trade flow as I mentioned, it could be a $30 million, $40 million impact this year. But again, we're a long way from that becoming an executive order. So we'll see. We're watching it as everybody else is. That is not yet in our guidance.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with Morgan Stanley.

Christopher Snyder
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I wanted to ask about consumer. Bill, I think you said December was up double digits. So with the quarter down 2%, I guess, October, November would be down high single. So really sharp positive rate of change there. I guess is there anything to call out with the comps? Did December just have a really easy comp? Because it doesn't seem like you guys expect much of that strength to continue into Q1. Maybe 1 month doesn't make a trend, so too early. But any color there would be appreciated.

William Brown
CEO & Chairman

Yes. We typically -- Chris, we typically see seasonality within the quarter in CBG to be lower in the first couple of months and then higher in the third month. We saw that pattern play out each quarter last year, including in Q4. This one was a little bit different. It was a little bit weaker in October, November than we would have expected and then a little bit stronger in December than we would have expected. I think part of it was the team pushing pretty hard, a lot of really good work that the team did in promotional programs with our large retailers who also were striving to drive their growth. And that combination, I think, paid some dividends in December. So we grew a little bit better than expected in December, a little bit weaker in October, November.

I wouldn't read too much into the trend so far in the first couple of weeks. Let's see how the next number of weeks and maybe a couple of months go. But at least it seems to be holding okay to what we had expected in the first couple of weeks. So I wouldn't read too much into that at this moment, Chris.

Christopher Snyder
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I appreciate that. And then if I could follow up on the U.S. IP assumption. You guys are calling for flat in '26 after 1% growth in '25. When we look at the quarterly U.S. industrial production numbers, they seem to be strengthening as '25 went along. You guys are obviously calling for things to soften. Do you see anything out there that is softening? Is there just some conservatism in that assumption?

William Brown
CEO & Chairman

So you're right. I mean if you look at IPI through the course of last year, what we're seeing backward looking, it did improve sequentially over the course of the year. It was a little bit stronger in the back half than it was in the front half. According to forecast, it looks like it's flattish in 2026. So we're reading those numbers.

For us, as I mentioned before, we do expect our industrial business to continue to perform very well. The two areas within industrial that we're watching. One is in auto aftermarket. It looks like it's still remaining relatively soft or expected to remain soft on car repair claims, both in U.S. and Europe as well as in the roofing granules business because of the housing market, consumers not looking to replace the roofs right now. That business has been a little bit soft, in fact, it's very soft in the fourth quarter. We expect some softness in the beginning of this year. But again, I just come back to the -- with the execution of the team in commercial excellence and NPI. I think they're doing a very good job. I expect it will outperform that industrial macro as we get into '26.

Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.

So as you said, you originally forecast in '25 averaging high-teens growth from that rolling 5-year new products. But you averaged closer to mid-20%. It's obviously one of the metrics leading to your market outgrowth. But what could it average in '26? And does it suggest you get higher than that $300 million or higher, as you just said in terms of market outgrowth?

William Brown
CEO & Chairman

So we do see a higher in '26 than '25 in terms of market outgrowth. And it's exactly from the progress made on innovation and 5-year new product sales coming up. Again, when we look at the '26 numbers, we assess the macro as it affects 3M to be on the order of around 1.7%, that we're projecting growth of the company, organic growth of 3%. That delta, that outgrowth is over $300 million above the macro. Half of that is coming from new product introductions, both those that were launched at the back end of '25, we had a very good back half as well as those that we expect will launch in 2026.

So I feel really good about the trajectory we're on and the momentum we're building here. This is really, I think, moving the needle. With a little market tailwind, we'll see even greater pickup, but I feel good that we'll outgrow the macro next year -- this year, '26 as a result of some of the initiatives we have in place on NPI and commercial excellence.

Got it. And then you were able to essentially hold the line, I think, all year in '25 in Consumer in terms of growing margin nicely despite flattish sales. And with the understanding that Q4 organic sales declined, it seems like you still had a relatively significant degradation in margin performance. So could you give us more color on that? Was it mostly just the increased advertising promos that you talked about? And can you talk about your confidence level in growing consumer margin or at least holding up in '26?

William Brown
CEO & Chairman

Yes. So good question. It was the promos and discounts that were offered. I think for the whole year, we did very well. We're up 130 basis points. We're down 110 in the fourth quarter. But again, for the year, really good. The team is doing an excellent job of focusing on the priority brands and appropriately investing in [indiscernible]. The NPI launches in CBG were really good, up double year-over-year, and I expect margin growth as we get into '26 as well as they really level out the business. So I feel pretty good about the structure that we have in place in CBG and the strategy that's being executed and with a little bit of consumer recovery, you'll see that coming through in the CBG business this year. So I appreciate that question.
