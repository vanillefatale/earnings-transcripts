Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Michael Baker of D.A. Davidson.

Michael Allen Baker

Okay. Great. Hopefully, you can hear me. I wanted to ask -- great quarter. One question, one follow-up. Let's first, just talk about the expenses and the incentive comp and how that plays out going forward? And just sort of how should we think about expenses on a quarterly basis? I think the math implies about $78 million in SG&A for each quarter in the back half on average. Is that the right run rate going forward as we think about 2026 and 2027?

Heather Plutino

Mike, Heather, hear you loud and clear. A question on SG&A, sure. $78 million per quarter, I think that's exactly right. The thing that I will remind you of, though, that's a good average per quarter, but Q4 ticks up about 3% versus Q3 because of holiday sales. So just kind of think about that as you calendarize. And as we go forward into 2026, we haven't conveyed that yet broadly. I can help you with modeling in our follow-up call.

Michael Allen Baker

Well, I guess I don't want to waste my follow-up on this, but let me ask 2 more, if I could. One, just thinking about that and the gross margin outlook, what's the right sort of incremental margin flow-through on incremental sales? I understand there's a lot of noise this year, particularly as you cycled some things last year, but more about 2026 and 2027, how do we think about incremental margins?

Heather Plutino

Yes. So we've mentioned before that our goal is 20% to 25% EBITDA flow-through, which we define as the change in EBITDA over the change of sales versus the prior year. This particular fiscal year is a little choppy because of some odd compares in the last year period and the builds of the incentive comp this year. So if you try to normalize that, then you end up at about 25% certainly in the back half of the year of 2025. But that's what we're looking at going forward is 20% to 25% profit flow-through.

Michael Allen Baker

Got it. All right. If I could sneak in one more. I'm intrigued by the trend director, I think you called her or Fashion Creative Director or him, I guess I don't know her. Any examples of what you're learning from that new hire, how we think that might show up in terms of what the merchandise looks like?

Kenneth Duane Seipel

Yes. A couple of things on that, Mike. Thanks for the question. Since she's joined, she's really been acutely focused on really interpreting and understanding the consumer voice, but more importantly, the current landscape around the consumer. And what we've been able to gain from her insights is really taking the -- what I call the voice of the consumer and starting to translate that into tangible style and tangible trends.

So looking at, obviously, all the emerging things that are happening culturally around on the landscape, it's pretty difficult to sift through all that. But she's done a nice job of sifting through all the things, all the noise out there and distilling it into a handful of key focus trends. And what that has allowed our merchants to do then is to go to market with very specific filters on curating against this trend. And so we're starting to see some of that show up.

I gave props to our men's team earlier. They've done a nice job of embracing the concept right out of the gate, and they're getting good results in addition to the work that they're doing in their core programs, which has been good work. So these 2 things kind of coming

together give us a sense that we're on to something. And I believe that you'll start to see the results of better, more accurate and more thoughtful curation as we get into Q4. I'm really excited about where we're headed there.

Operator

The next question is coming from Jeremy Hamblin of Craig Hallum.

Jeremy Scott Hamblin

Congrats on the impressive results. I wanted to get into the commentary about -- it sounds like seeing momentum has really continued here in Q3 even as you're lapping much, much tougher compares. I wanted to see if you can provide a bit more color on what's driving that sustained momentum. I know you talked about broad-based execution in Q2. But are you seeing more branded deals potentially driving the sustained strength or more well-rounded assortment? Any color you might be able to share on that would be helpful.

Kenneth Duane Seipel

Yes. Sure, Jeremy. Thanks for the question. And it literally is all of the above. What's happened, I think, in the course of the last year is we've continued to refine starting first, I mentioned on the call earlier, our preseason planning capabilities where we've really been thoughtful about how do we go in and attack the season as we call it. So we really -- we put a good road map out there for winning in Q3 and what do we need to do to get Q3 off to a good start from a back-to-school perspective.

And then that was supported with very thoughtful plans from all of our merchant teams. We do something in a category review process where we generally put stakes in the ground on what categories can grow. And then behind that, then we back that up with the finances, right, and the open to buy and the amount of receipts required to support those ideas. And it's a very basic program, to be honest with you, most retailers do it, but I think we're doing it better than ever and very disciplined and very thoughtful about it.

And then the bottom line is you can put a good plan together, but then it comes down to execution. So that's where our teams have been out in the market, finding the better product, finding the better styles. So I'd give you a combination, and you can see this in our store, but to give you one example, the team really embraced the brand True Religion, which has been around for a while, but it's actually resonated across the board with our consumers, and it was shared against multiple categories, and it's showing up across the store in all lines versus just in one category, where we might have approached that in the past.

And those ideas like that, there are many more that our teams are building on each other's ideas, and we're starting to see a much better curated product assortment for the total consumer. And then I'd be remiss if I didn't mention our teams in the field and the execution that's going on there, where they've really stepped up their game considerably when it comes to moving freight from the backroom to the floor in a more expedient way. Presentation standards have improved and our DC as well as moving things through.

So it literally is from my desk, it's a combination of all things kind of coming together quite well. And I guess I would also share with you that as we sit around as a leadership team and think about what's working and what opportunities we have ahead, frankly, we come up with more things on the to-do list than we do on the done list, right? And it's a little bit humbling to realize how far we've come and how far we really have to go. But anyway, I'm sorry about the rambling answer there, but the point is it really truly is -- it's a combination of all of the detailed execution of the strategy kind of coming together.

Jeremy Scott Hamblin

Very helpful. I wanted to shift gears then and talk a little bit about the store base. So you've increased the number of remodels from 50 to 60 that you planned for this year, and I think it sounds like 50 on an ongoing basis. And then as you plan to get back into a unit growth mode, should we be thinking that FY '26 is a mid-single-digit type unit growth?

And then if you could just share some of the economics behind how much the remodels cost, what type of lift you're getting from them? And then what you expect kind of the new store economics to be on new openings on a go-forward basis?

Kenneth Duane Seipel

For sure. I'll give you some of the strategy then and have Heather fill in some of the color on the results there for you. But yes, a couple of things. So this year, we did adjust. We actually added a few more remodels. I think we previously announced 50, and we had line of sight to add 10 more for strategic reasons.

Actually, to let you know what we're up to, we added some stores in our Jacksonville market in Columbia, South Carolina market to complement a couple of new store openings we have in those markets. We're going to try to go in and revitalize those markets and refresh the brand on an entire MSA basis. I'm excited about what that might do. We're going to learn a little bit more about that.

Our new stores opened up in October, and all of those remodels will be completed there. So the reason we added 10 more stores was just to accomplish a full remodel in both of those marketplaces. Going forward, on a new store growth perspective, we are going to get into the mid-single digits. We have line of sight to a number of sites already for 2026. We don't have an exact number of where we're going to be in there, but there will be some number between 25 and 40 new stores in 2026. I would expect at least 25 in that mix, and there may be more, we'll see. We'll have -- I'll be able to announce that on future calls more specifically, but it will be in that range.

And then the out years after that, we'll have the flywheel build. So we're still kind of building our pipeline. And as I mentioned earlier in my remarks, we're looking very specifically at opportunistic MSAs across the nation. We've identified many of those already as places to go. And now we have the hard work of trying to get in and find the right site inside of the market. So that work is underway as we speak as well in a lot of key markets.

The final thing I'll say in terms of return on investment at a high level, our new stores, we're putting them under a financial rigor. And I want you to think about our new store growth going forward as a triangle, right? There's -- on one side of the triangle is the rigor and discipline around making sure that we have the right site selection, consumer demographics and so forth.

The other part of the triangle is the actual end market site itself being in an attractive center and so forth. And then the third part of the triangle is financial rigor, which is making sure that we hold ourselves to a high standard of return on investment.

And so with that, I'll turn that over to Heather to let her fill in a little bit of color on that as well as the remodel question you had.

Heather Plutino

Yes. I'm going to start with the remodel, if you don't mind, Jeremy. You asked about remodel expense and results. So remodel expense, you'll remember, I think it was 2023, we cut the expense of a remodel in about half, right? So on average, we're at somewhere between $85,000 per location to $130,000. I can tell you that the remaining remodels for this year are averaging at $100,000 per store, and these are high-volume stores, like $1.9 million per.

And then from a results perspective, we continue to see sales lift when we remodel stores. It varies by market, but we're still very comfortable that we're getting return. I think it's important, though, that on a store-by-store basis, that amount is going to change store by store. So in some locations, it's really -- it's a matter of refreshing the fleet and doing a market presentation, right? So Ken just talked about Jacksonville, talked about Columbia, South Carolina. We're going to touch stores in that market to make sure that we are doing a full market press on here's the new iteration of Citi Trends.

And what we want excitement in every door, we want excitement with our associates. We don't want anybody to feel left behind. So we're thinking about remodels maybe a little bit differently in that it's about fleet maintenance as much as it is about driving incremental sales.

For new stores, the financial rigor that Ken spoke of, yes, absolutely. We are applying financial metrics, making sure we've got the right return on investment. We've got the right payback period. We've got the right with the right, the right, right? We're looking at it very closely in partnership with our real estate team.

Top line, you've heard Ken talk about this before. Ideally, we want our per store average at about $1.45 million, not to put too fine a point on it, but $1.45 million per door. Are we going to get that every time? No, but that's what we're striving for, right? And rents at 10%, we've got control payroll, all of that, right? So from a 4-wall flow-through, we look for mid-teens and up to make sure that we're supporting the financial performance of the full chain. So that's kind of a look behind the curtain there.

Jeremy Scott Hamblin

That's great color. If I could sneak in just one more. Ken, on the last call, you had mentioned some supply chain initiatives that you're working on, trying to reduce, I think, the number of days in supply chain and that would allow you to save some money in costs. And I wanted to just understand where are you on that initiative? I know it sounds like as you make progress, you realize you have more progress to make, but I was hoping for a quick update on where that initiative stands.

Kenneth Duane Seipel

Yes, for sure, Jeremy. We are in -- again, I use the term early stages, but I think it's fair to say early stages there. We've -- what I would call taken out the low-hanging fruit. Obviously, we're much faster now.

And so think about the supply chain in 3 big parts, okay? Part number one is vendor to DC. And we're better at managing that in our transportation routing and speed of picking up there. We've taken out a few days of that moment. Then you have your in-DC processing. And then the third part is DC to store. And we've actually sped up the DC to store considerably. That we've changed our routing to actually UPS carrier, it's taken 3 or 4 days out of the supply chain from DC to store. So the team did that really at the beginning of the year. We've learned how to optimize that, and so we're significantly faster there.

The area that we're really focused on right now is what I would call the in-DC portion. And some of the work that is underway is in our receiving characteristics. You mentioned -- I mentioned earlier in Event Analytics, the AI-based system. When we throw the switch on that in September, that will save 2 days out of our receiving process or 1.5 days right there.

And then we're going to be adding to that better ticketing standards, which are already being worked on and getting in place right now that will speed up our ticketing portion. And then there's a processing portion, which will speed up as well. So those things have been designed now. We understand what we need to do. Now it's a matter of getting them implemented. And so we're at different stages of implementation. But I would expect over the third quarter that the majority of these ideas will at least be implemented in our DC, and then we'll start to kind of see and feel better optimization as we get into Q4. So it definitely is a work in progress, but we've made good steps forward with a lot more to do there in the DC.

Operator

Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Seipel for closing comments.

Kenneth Duane Seipel

All right. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. Goodbye.
