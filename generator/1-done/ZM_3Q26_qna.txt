Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Tyler Radke with Citi.

Tyler Radke
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

All right. So really nice to see the stabilization and acceleration in the business as well as the margin expansion. Just a multi-parter here on growth. So can you -- if we look at Q4, the outlook looks very strong. How should we be thinking about that as a jumping off point into next year? And I ask because I know there were some price increases that you took on the online business this year. How do you think about pricing heading into next year? And then big picture, you're kind of near that 5% growth mark, certainly should be by Q4. What do you need? What are sort of the stepping stones to get back to a 10% growth over the long run?

Michelle Chang
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I can jump in and take that one. First of all, we're not sort of at our planning process to the stage of getting FY '27 guidance. We're going to go ahead and do that as per the normal kind of same process in February. With that said, maybe to touch on a couple of your questions with more specifics. Any pricing kind of elements we would -- we always try and give real clarity to investors. If we choose to do that, you would also get that in the February time zone. So maybe let me just pause a little bit and share some thoughts about how we think about kind of long-term growth First, with this latest forecast, enterprise will continue to be the predominant growth driver.

With this latest round, you'll see that we do expect online to be a slight increase on the full year. And really, the elements that investors should have top of mind as they think about growth path for '27 or even beyond that are the same elements that we've been talking about, first and foremost, stabilization, excuse me, of churn. And then product diversification, moving upmarket. And really those 3 priorities are going to be also the predominant drivers and focus of growth going forward.

Our next question is from Michael Funk with Bank of America.

Michael Funk
BofA Securities, Research Division

Yes. Great. Great. Maybe a related question asked a slightly different way. So looking at the enterprise net dollar expansion you reported, still below 100%, clearly, an opportunity to help drive top line growth if that does improve. Several competitors, though noted they're continuing to see post-COVID seat-based contraction. So can you peel apart the pressure on NDE and if you're also seeing post-COVID seat-based contraction? And if you are, when do you expect that to turn and maybe contribute to more positive top line growth?

Michelle Chang
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. First, thanks for the question. Look, we're pleased after 6 quarters to see the net dollar expansion stabilizing. We're not going to sort of guide to inflection, but certainly inflection is the goal. What I would say in terms of how to think about it, maybe just a continued reminder for investors that when we have products like Contact Center and Workvivo that tend to bring in new customers to Zoom, those will obviously take a little while to play through the dynamic of the metric. But overall, in terms of your maybe more specific question about seat count, that's not something that we've seen be a huge element to our quarter. Certainly, always customers here and there will have seat pressures, but we've seen overall a very strong macro demand.

Operator

Our next question is from Rishi Jaluria with RBC Capital Markets.

Rishi Jaluria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

There we go. My apologies on that. Maybe just one simple one for me. Coming out of Zoomtopia, there was conversation around M&A. And I know you've done some 2 small tuck-ins right now. Is this just kind of how we should be thinking about M&A for you going forward in terms of it will be more technological, low tuck-in in nature, obviously accelerating your road map? Or is there a potential for maybe more transformational M&A?

Michelle Chang
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks, Rishi, for the question. Really, I would say our thoughts on M&A are very consistent to kind of what I said previously, really no change just to update investors. But let me go ahead and recap them just for everybody's knowledge. First of all, is that we're going to be very thoughtful and disciplined in both acquisitions and integrations. We're going to make sure that they're strategically aligned with synergies and obviously coming with sound financials. And for Zoom, that typically will mean small- to medium-sized investments. Think of the Bonsi and BrightHire M&A as small in nature, if helpful.

Operator

Our next question comes from Josh Baer with Morgan Stanley.

Josh Baer
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Congrats on the beat and raise. I wanted to double-click on growth, enterprise growth from one more angle, just really double-clicking on Zoom Phone ARR, which is growing mid-teens, customer experience, high double-digit growth, Workvivo, you have rapid growth there. Could you walk through each of those growth areas? Just wondering how you think about the sustainability of those growth vectors.

Michelle Chang
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Maybe I can take that one. And maybe I'll use the opportunity as well, Josh, just to call out to investors that we made a slight tweak to the 3 priorities that we've been highlighting to investors, really 2 themes of what we were trying to get across. One, AI in all of our priorities; and two, really just sharpening kind of the language with which we talked about our priorities. So let me introduce them or reintroduce some of the same as what Eric talked about in the script and give an update to sort of get at your product-specific question.

The first one is really about elevating workplace with AI. And broadly, what that means is AI over the entire meeting life cycle. And the things that I would think about in terms of growth and progress that we saw in Q3 there are continued progress against churn. It is the fifth consecutive quarter on enterprise sort of year-over-year declines on churn, and you obviously heard the call out in online for record low churns. But not just that, it's the Zoom Phone. And increasingly, how much AI comes up in our win rates, you see it in the 10 million seats in the mid-teen growth.

Second big priority for us is to drive new products with AI. I should mention on the previous one, also integral to that, that sort of sets up the second one is getting that AI usage going. And so that's where we continue to see 4x year-over-year MAU increase in our AI. When it comes to new products in AI, we have sort of the horizontal that builds up that AI usage, and you see the big names in Salesforce and Oracle. Still early days, but pleased to see that in our second quarter and building off the names we shared last quarter.

And certainly, then there's vertical, be it our ZRA product, our new BrightHire acquisition. And then last to kind of get at your contact center question or comment is really to scale AI-first customer experience, whether that's agent-assisted or virtual agent. really there, what you're seeing called out by Eric in his script is strong high digit -- high double-digit, excuse me, revenue growth, customer growth in the 60-plus percent. And then also just in the nature of the deals, a strong AI preference, 9 of the top 10 deals pulling AI and many pulling both virtual and our agent assisted. So a lot that we're excited about as we pivot to growth going forward to update on our product side.

Next up, we'll hear from Ryan MacWilliams with Wells Fargo.

Ryan MacWilliams
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Good to see you again. Really cool to see the AI Avatar in the prepared remarks, maybe one day, I'll be asking AI Michelle about growth next year. Just kidding.

Michelle Chang
Chief Financial Officer

[indiscernible] Ryan, to talk to one another.

Ryan MacWilliams
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Yes. AI Mac, I don't know if you can recreate the Philly accent. But just one for Eric actually. So Zoom has had really strong product velocity historically. And as product development time line shrink even further with Agentic coding. Do you think this offer Zoom the opportunity to build more product density into your existing products with new features or expand into new product categories?

Eric Yuan
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman

Well, that is a great question. I think in the AI era, I think every business is, right, and are facing the similar challenge and also the great opportunities. So the innovation speed is unprecedented. Look at the way the engineer write the code, Look at the marketing sales team, how they leverage the AI to automate the process. We got to leverage AI to reinvent everything. The good news, I have an engineering background, right? And I think I have to -- I also determined, right, to spend way more time than any time in my career to double down, triple down on the product side.

I think there's a huge opportunity, meaning we have to change the company culture and make sure [indiscernible] engineers, right? The way they write the code is totally different. The way they troubleshoot the test also is very different. We need to make sure every engineer, even if they write the tens of thousand lines of code before, they have to embrace AI now. Back to your question, I truly believe the innovation speed will be much faster to build new features and new services, right? I think that's an opportunity. And we are much better positioned, right? And again, I'm figuring out a way to really spend more time on that.

That's the reason why I can tell you, I couldn't be more excited now. Finally, I think we are going back to the early days of Zoom, double on the product, leverage the AI, build innovative services. And you are right.

Our next question comes from Patrick Walravens with Citizens.

Patrick Walravens
Citizens JMP Securities, LLC, Research Division

Let me add my congratulations. I love the accident that you picked there. I don't know what it was, but it was fantastic. Can you go into some detail and help us understand exactly how the Salesforce win works? Like Eric, if you're sitting there with [indiscernible], how do you pitch it, right? And then just give us some details on how it changes the experience for people at Salesforce.

Eric Yuan
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. So Salesforce is a great company. Mark is a great friend also with our [indiscernible], I'm pretty sure he think about AI every day as well. Look at the Salesforce event, right? In June force is very successful, the Agentic force event, very successful, right? So they have Agentic force framework. They also have a customer and how to integrate our AI -- I mean, sorry, the customer [indiscernible], right, to integrate with the agentic force the framework. Essentially, we drive the productivity. right? Because they have a framework with our customer company together, for sure, that's no-brainer, right, to integrate together.

Given our customer, why not, right, to enable this feature. That's how this conversation started. That's the reason why they decided to move forward with the customized company. More and more customers realize the potential of not only for Zoom AI company, but also the customized AI company. I think that's the reason why in the next month, we are going to announce our Zoom AI Company 3.0 with GA, right? So a lot of opportunity ahead of us. Salesforce, again, just one example. Thank you. Yes. I will invite you to test our AI Company 3.0 next month whenever we're with GA. So I'm pretty excited. So our employees really like that too.

Operator

Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.

Aleksandr Zukin
Wolfe Research, LLC

Eric, I'd love to test out that virtual avatar when it's ready for GA. Maybe just a quick one for you and a quick one for Michelle. For you, Eric, when you think about AI monetization that you're seeing in the business in the quarter and in the coming quarters, maybe talk about that a little bit. And then Michelle, for deferred revenue was a little bit light of your high end of your guide this quarter, but it seems like it's actually a pretty strong guide for next quarter. Was there anything that shifted from one quarter to the next or pushed out or pulled in that maybe explains that?

Eric Yuan
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman

So Alex, by the way, the virtual feature already there, right? This is the third time I'm using my AI avatar for our earnings call, right? I free up a lot of my time. I really love that. So back to your question to monetize AI, as Michelle mentioned, right, look at the few priorities, right, Elevate Zoom Workplace with AI and double down on the AI-centric product. You look at our horizontal collaboration suite, AI companion, as Michelle mentioned, right, if you look at the usage year-over-year, already 4x more, right? Customer coming, we can monetize team. And also we are going to have introduced the new SKU to monetize AI company as well online, and that is on one hand.

On the other hand, we also have vertical services like Zoom Contact Center, right, and virtual agent Zoom AI Assistant, right? And also the Zoom Revenue Accelerator for each of those departmental applications, including the vertical market solutions like Zoom Workplace for educators, right, and clinicians and also for the frontline workers, a lot of AI features already built in, we can monetize. Notable mention Zoom AI combined 3.0 will be ready next month. I think almost everywhere, and we can leverage AI, improve the productivity, improve the features. At the same time, we also can monetize as well.

It's not a single thing, right? a single product, we want to monetize. It's almost everywhere across the entire product portfolio. Back to the BrightHire acquisition. The reason why we acquired that company also leverage AI to improve the hiring as well. So essentially, AI is a foundation for us. We can monetize, we can innovate.

Michelle Chang
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And it's helpful, Alex, maybe just to tag on to Eric, and then I'll hit your deferred revenue question. We produced Zoomtopia as sort of a framework of AI monetization because it does kind of monetize indirectly and directly in different ways. Happy to share that with investors after. And to Eric's point, as you go through that framework that we shared with investors, progress on every single front in the third quarter. To your deferred revenue question, look, we ended upper end of the range, gave a very consistent guidance in Q4. So nothing really to call out. Results were sort of as expected on the deferred revenue.

Our next question comes from Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer.

Timothy Horan
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Issue with other apps that are really important to kind of improve on your overall productivity strategy for software?

Michelle Chang
Chief Financial Officer

First part of the question says, sorry. Cut out. Can you -- would you mind repeating that.

Timothy Horan
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Yes, sure. Sorry, Michelle. An important part of the strategy, I think, is to integrate with other productivity software apps. Can you talk about some of the most critical ones and where you are in that process?

Michelle Chang
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Eric, do you want to take that?

Eric Yuan
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman

Sure. I think, first of all, we have -- we are way beyond video conferencing, right? So we have so many other services we would like to integrate. At the same time, look at the ecosystem, right? We do integrate with Google ecosystem well and Microsoft ecosystem well as well and plus ServiceNow, Salesforce and Atlassian, all those popular productivity tools, right? We all work on the integration. Again, this is the open ecosystem. And also, we listen to our customers very carefully. Whenever they tell us, hey, they need more integration, we also work on that as well. So.

Tom Roderick
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

And is AI making that easier or harder at this point?

Eric Yuan
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman

And easy and harder, meaning the reason why easy for sure, from an execution perspective, for sure, easier. The harder part is because of the AI every customer, they want to tell us, hey, given the AI era, can you integrate more, right? Can you release in a timely manner, right? So the requirement is different, right? So from that perspective, a little bit harder, but it really goes on to execution. So I have confidence our team can deliver.

Our next question is from Seth Gilbert with UBS.

Seth Gilbert
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Thanks for the question. Free cash flow is a bit above what we and the Street were modeling and free cash flow margin hit 50%. I'm curious if you call out anything additional here? Were there any onetime benefits to free cash flow?

Michelle Chang
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks, Seth. Obviously, we're pleased with the Q3 results. And as such, it made sense to update the full year guidance as well. So I'm pleased with the overall progress, frankly, that we made since the beginning of the year, our kind of guidance. With that said, to your question specifically on the onetime, look, there are very durable results as part of that. You see that obviously in our core financials. The one thing that we did put into the script that I would make sure I emphasize with investors is we made some changes as part of our collections process, really looking at that more end-to-end as a new CFO coming in and as a result, we were able to make real notable progress on DSO.

Those are sustainable changes to our DSO. But obviously, you won't continue to see that marked progress as we go forward, meaning it won't continue to accelerate off that. So you can kind of think about that as durable but onetime a bit in nature.

Eric Yuan
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman

Yes, by the way, our CFO Michelle. She did a great job, really drive the team, right, dramatically improve our collection process. This is very sustainable.

Next, we'll hear from James Fish with Piper Sandler.

James Fish
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Maybe, Eric, for you on BrightHire. Is this the start of expanding into other mission-critical business workflows? Or how should we think about -- I'm not asking about the M&A strategy, but more about that sort of broader platform expansion. And Michelle, how should we think at this point about the duration of the overall installed base?

Eric Yuan
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman

Well, this is a great question. So -- and my great friend, Jim Cramer, he made a comment recently, right? And this is Zoom would become more than just Zoom, right? And that's actually our strategy over the past few years. double down on Zoom Phone, launched Zoom Contact Center, leverage our technology, right, to focus on those business mission-critical use cases. We are already doing that already over the past few years. BrightHire acquisition is just another way for us to double down on business mission-critical applications. We cannot build everything by ourselves, right? Why not, right? So we do not have a great remote hiring solution to target HR remote high-end use case, right? BrightHire fits very well to our strategy.

You will see that more and more, we are going to leverage AI because data AI and focus on those business mission-critical use cases. We more than just video conferencing, and this is all our strategy over the past few years, and we are going to continue that strategy. So your comment is right.

Michelle Chang
Chief Financial Officer

And just I get to your right question, your question on installed base was in regards to BrightHire or?

James Fish
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

No, it was a separate question around the duration that you're seeing because it seems as though you guys are doing pretty well on sort of cross-sell of existing products, and you're seeing that show up also on the long-term RPO, really driving some growth here on the overall RPO. So just trying to understand where the duration of the enterprise contracts has gone.

Michelle Chang
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Look, I think, look, many quarter-to-quarter, you're going to see fluctuations. We've had a very consistent RPO trend in the current. Very pleased with the current quarter RPO that went up, which really reflects a couple of large contact center and AI deals in particular. And so Look, I would say it varies from quarter-to-quarter, but we're very pleased with the upsell progress that we have relative to our upsell base as well as kind of what I was referencing earlier, which is bringing in new customers to the Zoom ecosystem. And in particular to the duration of deals, I would say sort of stabilized. There's obviously AI and contact center that brings in sort of longer-term nature of contracts, but a relatively stable trend with it.

Operator

Our next question is from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.

Arti Vula
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

This is Arti on for Mark Murphy. Congrats on the strong quarter. We recently spoke with a Zoom partner who was very positive on Zoom's products, pricing, just overall value prop. And they kind of called out particular momentum within the mid-market, legacy migrations, adoption of contact center AI products. From where you sit, are you seeing this relative strength in the mid-market segment as well?

Michelle Chang
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I would say to that end, I think we are. We're seeing a strong uptick of AI usage as well as strong uptick of usage in our 3-plus products. And certainly, this is, I would say, a sweet spot for Zoom from small business down to low-end enterprise and something that we're pleased with the results that we're seeing. And I think you can see it play out in many of our financial metrics.

Eric Yuan
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman

By the way, to add on to what Michelle just said, the reason why that mid-market, our sweet spot is, number one, those mid-market customers, they really embrace technology faster than any other segment, right? Two, mid-market customers truly care about employee experience, right? And they really want to deploy the best solution with a much better total cost of ownership. That's the reason why that's our sweet spot. That's the reason why we're winning over there.

Operator

Our next question is from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.

Unknown Analyst

This is Chad Tiba on here for Citi. Just wondering if you could touch on sort of the broader demand environment. I know there were some moving pieces earlier in the year, sort of how that shaped out during the quarter and expectations for the rest of the year.

Michelle Chang
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So look, I think in the quarter, we saw further improvement. I think you see it in metrics like our customers over 100,000 growing at 9%. Look, that doesn't mean that we're not going to see some seat pressure like we talked about earlier, that's certainly our business model and we won't be immune. But we saw broad consistent demand across both enterprise and online and full abatement, if that was your specific question, to what we referenced in our Q1 earnings. So with respect to our forecast, it assumes similar conditions to what we saw in the third quarter.

And maybe to end with sort of where Eric left us in the last question, Zoom, what we're going to focus on is not any conditions from one day to the next, given we are in a dynamic environment, but on providing sustainable TCO and business value to our customers. So sort of in the line of in uncertain conditions, you control what you can control. And to Eric's point earlier, we have a fantastic TCO story that we're leaning in on with our customers.

Operator

Next, we'll hear from Jackson Ader with KeyBanc.

Jackson Ader
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Michelle, on the, call it, the non-revenue top line metrics, you've talked about billings, you've talked about RPO. I'm just curious like as you shift more of your business towards the enterprise, when should we expect those non-revenue metrics to start to outgrow maybe your overall revenue metrics on the top line?

Michelle Chang
Chief Financial Officer

I mean in terms of the non-revenue metrics, I would point to things like our AI usage. I would point to product momentum type stats to which they already are outpacing our revenue growth. So I don't know, Jackson, correct me if I'm sort of missing your question, but I think those are the sorts of nonspecific explicit revenue drivers that I look at, and I would say they're already outpacing.

Unknown Analyst

No, no, no, that's helpful. Yes. Just curious about the dynamics there.

Eric Yuan
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Just quickly, Jackson, you're right. you're right, AI usage is really #1. The metrics we are looking at that every day. At the same time, the CSAT, other metrics also look at that, right? The customers are pretty happy not only for online customers, online buys, SMB and all the way to enterprise customers. We also measure CSAT as well.

Operator

Our next question is from Peter Levine with Evercore.

Peter Levine
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Maybe just a follow-up, I think, on Jim Fisher's question. If you think about -- Eric, you mentioned a lot about employee experience on this call and I look at BrightHire, I mean is this like the on-ramp into like Zoom getting into the HR stack, if it's interviewing, onboarding engagement. Just curious if you can maybe just talk about how you view -- is this the on-ramp into HR. And then if you think of other segments that you can get into, can you maybe just help us understand like where else Zoom can go with the platform expansion?

Eric Yuan
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman

Well, Peter, this is a great question. If you look at our core competency, look at our technology, right, in the collaboration and productivity suite and AI, this is our core technology and how to apply those technologies, right, into the use case, that's kind of every quarter, every year we are looking, right? That's the reason why a few years ago, we introduced the contact center, essentially to target the support and IT help desk, those kind of use cases department. We also have Zoom revenue accelerator, right, to target the sales department, right? We also have Zoom webinar plus also target marketing department.

You look at HR, HR is I would say is a huge use case. We are not going to focus on every use case at all, but we just focus on the remote hiring, right? Because we can leverage our technology. That's a very different use case. right? For those each department, how to leverage our product, AI and data, right, to improve the use case, that's our focus, including the vertical segment as well, like educators, clinicians as well. So if you understand our strategy, expanding strategy, you look at which department, which vertical market might benefit from our technology, AI and data, right? That's kind of thing we are going to focus on. So [indiscernible] hiring brightHire for sure, fits very well to our strategy for expansion.

Our next question is from Tom Blakey with Cantor Fitzgerald.

Thomas Blakey
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

A couple of quick ones, really just one for you, Eric, and a clarification for you, Michelle. Eric, you were key in leading the charge in terms of the higher pricing tiers in CX, and it's great to see the success you're having there. Another Zoom heritage is disrupting markets in terms of technology and pricing and products. You have some peers in CX talking about maybe possibly disrupting the CX market with regard to consumption-based pricing. I would love to hear your comments in terms of some forward-looking possible kind of statements there in terms of how Zoom could compete in the consumption-led CX market.

And just, Michelle, from a clarification perspective, I think you made some comment about online growth kind of up thinking off of fiscal 3Q, maybe possibly in fiscal 4Q when there was a decel in enterprise. Can you maybe clarify what we possibly could expect in terms of that mix would be helpful in fiscal 4Q.

Eric Yuan
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman

Tom, thank you for a good question. Just curious, your background is virtual background or real?

Thomas Blakey
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

That is as fake as it can be.

Eric Yuan
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman

Oh my God. I do not [indiscernible] so well. I did not realize that is real. So anyway, Yes, thank you. So back to your question, so you are so right on. Remember, I was Zoom Contact Center General Manager for a while, right? very excited about our contact center workforce management, quality management, those product over the past few years. but guess what? And because of AI, we have leveraged AI introduced a new product, which is a virtual agent, either chat-based agent or the voice agent. I feel like that's becoming more and more important, right? And because we have both we have the traditional contact center solution versus a virtual agent solution.

In terms of consumption of the business model, I think it will fit very well to our virtual agent, right? And because like customer deploy technology, right, how often they use a virtual agent, how many times use a virtual agent, right? So we got to based on how happy customer they are, right, for every call, right? If virtual agent can truly help address the customer issues, customers should pay for us. Otherwise, they should not because you fall back to the traditional agent solution, right? I think from that perspective, we are indeed thinking about the consumption-based model for the virtual agent or AI-based agentic technology. And yes, we are working on that. That's a great question.

Michelle Chang
Chief Financial Officer

Just to clarify, the virtual agent, while our agent-assisted product is a per user model, our ZVA product that Eric is referencing is already a consumptive business model. And certainly, then I think many in the industry talk about tying it more to outcome-based and we obviously are looking into that. But I just want to make sure it was clear that we are already consumptive based on our ZBA product. To my comments to clarify on the online, I was just with one more quarter clarity and the full year guidance out there.

So full year guidance of 4.1% at the midpoint. All I was trying to do in my comments is say that we've used a consistent forecast methodology. And previously to the investors, we've been saying sort of flattish online revenue. And obviously, with now most of the year playing out and the results realized in the online, we're just adjusting that to a tweak of slightly increasing. That's all.

Our next question is from William Power with Baird.

William Power
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Great. Eric, maybe let's stick with your contact center GM hat for a moment. But, can you maybe remind us and maybe update us where we are on contact center go-to-market? Where are we in terms of the opportunity in terms of channel partner reach? And I guess if you extend that, the opportunity outside the U.S., U.S. versus international, and I assume international is still on the earlier front.

Eric Yuan
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. So William, by the way, I was the contact center GM, I'm not any more like it. So if I do that, maybe focus on the virtual agent. But anyway, so back to your question, I think -- look at our -- the customers, right, [indiscernible] our platform last quarter, many of them are switching from other cloud vendors to Zoom Contact Center, right? That's the reason why channel partners are becoming our most important go-to-market strategy for our contact center solution. We are doubling down not only for U.S. market for international market as well because the contact center is very different buyers and the channels become increasingly important.

We already invested that now and also we're going to invest more, right? And for the -- in terms of the virtual agent and not only do we leverage our sales team channel partners, we're also thinking about the product-led growth because guess what, some of the developers for -- let's say, take the SMB customers, they can leverage our API, deploy those virtual agent technology by themselves. That's why I think about how to monetize contact center to leverage our product growth to target developers as well. That's another area we are looking into as well.

Michelle Chang
Chief Financial Officer

And it's helpful maybe just to punctuate Eric's comments to your GTM question in particular. We look at top 10 deals in contact center as sort of reflective of the demand and the customer signal that we see. It's helpful, 9 out of 10 of our largest deals were channel driven. So it's a very important investment to us and one that we're very pleased with the results.

Next, we'll hear from Arjun Bhatia with William Blair.

Alinda Li
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

This is Alinda on for Arjun. A question here on just like what type of customers are adopting custom AI companions in particular? And what incremental value are they seeing from the custom AI companion versus customers using the free AI companion?

Eric Yuan
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman

I think we -- for sure, we want to SMB, medium-sized, all the way to enterprise customers adopt customer AI companion as quickly as possible. But to start with, we focus on the relatively large enterprise customers for customer AI companion. The reason why the demand another reason is because look at our -- the value of customer AI companion, we can integrate with custom third-party applications. We can have agentic framework and for the data search as well and a lot of functionality features built for those a little bit complicated enterprise use cases, right? And that's the reason why we start from there. So for sure, we do have -- we want to introduce SKU for online buyers as well to empower the small and medium-sized business as well.

Just since Nick Tid's come in and started revamping your channel partners program, can you just give us any more color to how that channel partner platform is performing? Obviously, that 9 out of 10 is a great metric to hear. Just any further color there? And then also within that, you were one of the earliest to pivot to a partner-led professional services organization. Can you just give us a little bit of color as to how that may be helping you win certain deals?

Michelle Chang
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Maybe I can lead out on that one. So first, for a company that's going to focus on phone and customer experience, having a healthy, vibrant channel ecosystem is just part of the game, meaning it's how customers often want to buy. They're certainly a part of the deployment and services after. And so Zoom offers both a deep direct as well as through channel. It's also to Eric's comments earlier, I think one of the questions earlier integral to sort of our international expansion where Zoom has opportunity to go. In terms of how to think about success, I shared the earlier contact center, but also, we're just very pleased with a lot of the forward-looking metrics that we see with our channel ecosystem, Pipe up 30%.

The majority of contact center deals I talked about earlier coming from partner, over 50% of our large phone deals coming from partner and the types of partners that are transacting with us is also growing. So all in all, it's been a very big investment. And to my earlier comments, something that we're very pleased with the results.

Our final question comes from Peter Weed with Bernstein.

Peter Weed
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Thank you very much. I guess the Peters on this call have similar mind. I was really interested in BrightHire, and I appreciated your response around kind of a vertical-specific focus that you have, which makes a lot of sense, and I can understand why you're excited about that. How should we think about that opportunity? Like when you think of it relative to your existing customer base, how much of this is more of an upsell opportunity to them versus expanding the TAM to new customers? And when you kind of think about the monetization, how does this add to your stack and really could expand the TAM or generate revenue upside for the business?

Michelle Chang
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, maybe I can take that one and give you sort of the finance version because Eric talked about BrightHire earlier. First of all, it starts a lot at those critical conversations. One thing Zoom is fantastic at is really just nailing those critical conversations with our customers and that there couldn't be a more critical conversation for our customers than who and how they hire. It also offers Zoom the ability as AI monetization plays out across different markets to have a very tangible scenario for customers where the value point is very clear.

And so it certainly represents one of those vertical AI monetization scenarios. It's a large and unpenetrated market at roughly $3 billion. And so it certainly allows us to help them scale and also then gives us sort of an upsell piece beyond it. And they're a category leader in sort of a large TAM that is growing. So it's something we're very excited about.
