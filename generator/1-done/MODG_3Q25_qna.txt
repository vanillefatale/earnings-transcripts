And our first question here will come from Eric Wold with Texas Capital Securities.

Eric Wold
Texas Capital Securities, Research Division

So a couple of questions, I guess. First off, on the Golf Equipment side, I guess, given the demand that you're seeing, the strong demand that you're seeing for Golf Equipment with on-course participation, I guess, how much pricing power do you feel that you have on equipment, clubs and balls as you move into '26 to offset tariff pressure? And do you want to go down that road? Are you seeing competitors raise prices and do you feel that's a path you think you can take?

Oliver Brewer
President, CEO & Director

Eric, Chip. That's a good question and something that there's no clear answer on at this point. We've seen over time that the Golf Equipment category enjoys a passionate consumer and a wealthy consumer. So we do not believe that we're highly price elastic. And there's obviously healthy market conditions right now. So both of those go on the positive side. What I've seen over time is that the ability to raise price has been there, but it's dependent on how what we call DSPD or differentiated the product is. So as the product gets better, your pricing power gets better. And so we're going to have to see how that unfolds.

Without a doubt, given the tariff situation, if these are the final rates, we will take a look at pricing. And we'll have to be strategic about that. But on new products, along with the higher product costs, pricing will be part of our equation for mitigating the tariffs.

Eric Wold
Texas Capital Securities, Research Division

Perfect. And then just the final question kind of on Topgolf. Now we're kind of through the summer and you've seen kind of the reaction and improvement in visitation from the value initiatives. Maybe give us some sense of kind of the trends you've seen in kind of time at the bay and kind of how your ability to kind of book, shorter periods has impacted time at the bay and kind of -- then also what you see in terms of food and beverage attach rates kind of as the summer has played out?

Oliver Brewer
President, CEO & Director

Sure. Obviously, really pleased with the reaction to the value initiatives, the continued strength of the experience scores at Topgolf. Traffic has been up mid -- high teens candidly. And so we're winning share and I couldn't be more pleased with the reaction. One of the initiatives that they put in place was some variability on bay timing, so being able to book bays in smaller windows, so within an hour, 1.5 hours' time, not just 2 hours on the reservation system. That has been impactful. I wouldn't call it the most impactful of all the initiatives, but it has a positive response and certainly meeting the consumer where they are on that front.

And then on the food and beverage side, we are trending up. If you just try to isolate the food and beverage same venue sales, it's up. It's got a couple of different factors going on, but it's being driven by the traffic and no real change in trend. We've also been able to initiate some new offerings in the food and beverage sector, platters and such, which have been well received. There has been a continuation of the long-term trend of alcohol attachment, but no change in that trend. So food and beverage has been a positive for us as it relates to the quarter and pleased with it.

And our next question will come from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.

Simeon Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

My first question, it's on the business connected to the consumer. Can you talk about sell-through this quarter, not just sell-in or to the best you can? Anything that signals the consumer behavior is changing? And then related to that, it seems like '26 is going to be an important year for new launches, connecting any changes in behavior now to how the launch season could go early part of next year?

Oliver Brewer
President, CEO & Director

Sure, Simeon. We've seen excellent results in the golf segment, more or less all year, but strengthening in Q2 and then even stronger in Q3. It started the year with a little bit of a wet and cold spring. But as that transitioned, rounds played have been up and sell-through trends have been candidly terrific. And you've seen where the sell-through trends are higher than the sell-in trends. So a little bit of a destocking going on out at retail as well, which is also a net positive. The consumer just is very engaged, very healthy right now. And as we look forward, we're not really getting into estimates for 2026 at this point. But the strength of the consumer throughout the summer and through current has been quite positive. We've seen a long-term trend of strength around golf. So I feel really good about that.

Simeon Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And then as a follow-up, the width of Q4, the profit range, what don't you know about tariff today? Because you've taken mitigating actions, you have some sense of what it's going to cost. Is the width more related to Topgolf variability or the equipment business? Can you talk about the things that are in your control versus things that you left a little leeway with?

Oliver Brewer
President, CEO & Director

Sure. I'll let Brian comment on it. I'm not sure that we -- it's not intuitive to us that we have a particularly wider than normal range in terms of any of our metrics for Q4. Obviously, a fairly diverse business. So there's some level of range that is required there. But -- and there's tariffs, we -- there's no significant degree of uncertainty in the tariff. We're more and more comfortable with our understanding there as we move forward. So no -- nothing there to speak of.

Brian Lynch
Executive VP, Chief Legal Officer & CFO

That's right. That's the -- this is the normal range we give for this time of year. So there's really no -- nothing different than normal here.

And our next question will come from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.

Matthew Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great to see the progress. So Chip, on health of the golf industry, what are you seeing from new entrants to the sport today? And could you speak to the market share opportunity you see into next year if we're thinking about clubs relative to balls with the new Chrome launch on tap?

Oliver Brewer
President, CEO & Director

Yes, sure. Again, the health of the golf business is excellent. So really pleased with those trends. We don't really have hard data right on new participants, but we'll see some trailing data over the next few months as their report will come out, but it will be trailing data. But all indications are is that the participation is continuing to move positively. Visits to Topgolf is a leading indicator. And obviously, visits to Topgolf are quite strong. There are other strong new entrants and growth categories around off-course golf. The new -- the package set business is still quite strong. So by all indication, participation is continuing to grow, although I do not have hard data and the consumer is good.

In terms of market share opportunities, we're not going to get into 2026 estimates at this point. But as I always am at this point in time, I feel good about our product and our brand. We've had steady growth in the Golf Ball category. We had a very strong Q3 market share-wise in Golf Ball, which bodes well for the brand strength. And as you mentioned, next year will be a premium ball launch. So we're looking forward to that, and I look forward to talking to you about the new product and that opportunity in February.

Matthew Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great color. And then, Chip, at Topgolf, on the inflection to positive same venue sales in the third quarter, could you break apart the 700 basis points of sequential improvement? Maybe elaborate on trends or what you're seeing in October? And then just any update on potential strategic alternatives?

Oliver Brewer
President, CEO & Director

Okay. I got to jot these down. We're going a couple of different ways here. So the -- what we saw in Q3 was really during the quarter, an acceleration of what we talked about at the end of last quarter where the value initiatives were rolled out and started to resonate with consumer. We saw significant growth in traffic. We saw 1 to 2 bay inflect to positive and 3-plus bay, although still down, has moderated. And those are great trends, and they ended up with a positive quarter which obviously is very important for us, and we're excited about. October results have been fairly similar to what we saw in Q3. So same type of result, positive for 1 to 2 bay. Traffic, same kind of positive traffic that we saw in Q3 and 3-plus bay, although still down, moderating. So October on trend with Q3.

It's worth calling out, Matt, that as you look at Q4, the mix of 3-plus bay goes higher for us. So 3-plus bay is 30% of our volume in Q4 versus 20% for the full year. And as such, you just have a weighted average that is -- plays itself out in Q4, not really forecasting a change in trends there. We see positive trends that have been sustaining.

And then I think your last question was on the Topgolf process. And we're continue to fully engage in that and committed. We continue to evaluate both a spin and a sale. Unfortunately, no update on timing at this point. The timing was impacted by the CEO transition, but I feel good about that process. And it's probably also worth mentioning that the improved results and outlook should be positive for value creation, whatever the final outcome is.

And our next question will come from Arpine Kocharyan with UBS.

Unknown Analyst

This is [indiscernible] dialed in on behalf of Arpine Kocharyan. Could you talk through the puts and takes of how we should think about same venue growth for Topgolf into next year and whether there is any type of pricing or better mix versus more volume that's baked into your current thinking?

Oliver Brewer
President, CEO & Director

Sure. I'll try to do that. Obviously, pleased with the inflection, and we continue -- we're going to continue to lean in on these value initiatives. We're in the early innings, we think, of repositioning the consumer's perception of price at Topgolf. There's a chart in the presentation deck that shows that. We've made some progress, but a lot of progress to go. So the 1 to 2 bay traffic and value initiatives will continue. 3-plus bay is leveling off. We're optimistic that, that is likely to continue, and we also have some new initiatives there that we believe will be further impactful as that business proceeds. Those include per player pricing, 3 to 4 bay online and some dedicated marketing.

We're implementing Toast and that has seen a positive impact both on margins and on spend per visit. We'll have a little more than half of the bays on Toast by the end of the year with all of them on for Q2. So that should have a positive impact on spend per visit next year. We're also starting to trial and we'll implement next year pay-inBay and mobile ordering, which should have positive impacts as well. We're introducing frequency programs. We introduced the summer, Summer Fun Pass. It was highly successful. We'll be leaning further into that, and we're now implementing a subscription program. It's very early, but we're -- we've seen a lot of other similar businesses have a lot of success with that. Ours is called Playmore and we'll be implementing that and optimizing that.

We're going to continue to drive more optimized marketing. We've seen our marketing become more and more efficient as the new team there has gotten their hands on the wheel and implemented performance marketing and marketing that has resonated with the consumer. And then we're also going to continue to deliver new reasons to visit. That's new games, experiences. We did the football game this fall, and that will be part of our play mix as well. No specific call-outs on pricing at this point, but I hope I answered your question.

Unknown Analyst

Yes. And a second one, how should we think about unit openings for Topgolf into next year, assuming plans for separation could take a bit longer?

Oliver Brewer
President, CEO & Director

We are planning 3 new venues for next year.

And our next question will come from Anna Glaessgen with B. Riley Securities.

Anna Glaessgen
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

I'd like to go back to the Topgolf comp inflection or same venue sales inflection, really good to see. Maybe anything you could share on the complexion of visitors maybe between new and maybe lapsed visitors versus the past and maybe that repurchase or revisit behavior maybe versus prior cohorts?

Oliver Brewer
President, CEO & Director

Sure. Anna, we've seen -- we haven't seen any real change in economic profile or demographics. We've seen that the uptick in traffic is 2/3 repeat visitors and about 1/3 new. So just an outstanding mix from our perspective. And in terms of actually moving the needle yet on our frequency, given our frequency is 1.5 per year, it's too soon to -- you wouldn't really see it yet, but you're seeing great consumer behavior and a mix of new and repeat and the reaction has been both immediate and definitive.

Anna Glaessgen
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then thinking through the corporate event business in 4Q, while understanding that it tends to hit later in the quarter. Typically, what's your visibility? I would think, generally, especially around holiday events, people would want to have that booked earlier. So just trying to think through that dynamic and your level of visibility there.

Oliver Brewer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We have a reasonable level of visibility on that now. So we've got a significant portion. We get in the ballpark just over half of them booked 30 days out. But there's still a significant amount that we'll be booking here in the balance of November and even through early December. So we have a good read on that and have put that into our guidance.

And our next question will come from Noah Zatzkin with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Noah Zatzkin
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I guess maybe just to kind of follow up on the corporate business. Nice improvement in Q3. Is that just a function of comps? Or was there other kind of corporate behavior changes that you'd point to or expect kind of going forward?

Oliver Brewer
President, CEO & Director

When you say Q3, you're just asking about corporate events in Q3?

Noah Zatzkin
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Yes, exactly.

Oliver Brewer
President, CEO & Director

Okay. Yes. So we just -- we've seen -- we took actions during the quarter and in terms of some marketing and changing how we're doing our sales organization structure and including repositioning some of the product during the early part of the year. And so I think some of that has been impactful. And I do believe that a significant part of this is also just a leveling out or, as you say, comps, but leveling of the overall market, which had declined, but is not going to be going away and will initially -- will eventually recover and be a strong opportunity for us.

Noah Zatzkin
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

And maybe just one more. Any updated thoughts kind of heading into holiday around TravisMathew and how you're thinking about that business?

Oliver Brewer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. TravisMathew is a strong brand and an excellent business. The market overall in Athleisure has been challenged this year. We've outperformed that market. They've gained share over the last quarter. So I was pleased with their last quarter results and optimistic on trends going into Q4. But again, that's been baked into our guide.

And our next question will come from Joe Altobello with Raymond James.

Martin Mitela
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

This is Martin Mitela on for Joe Altobello. I wanted to quickly touch on the CEO search. I know I understand that you're kind of in the middle of the process here. But just trying to gauge how much time this new person in the role sort of need before the separation is ready to be enacted?

Oliver Brewer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Martin, I don't know whether I have a specific answer on that. So we're not commenting on the time there. I think the most important thing is that we've got strong interest in candidates and therefore, feel very encouraged. And as well, the existing team is just doing a terrific job. So I couldn't be more pleased with both that process and how the existing team is being able to manage this period of transition.

Martin Mitela
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Understood. And just kind of quickly turning to tariffs. I understand you're not giving any formal guide for next year. You've offered a $40 million number for this year. Is there anything that you might be able to give us about what we should expect for 2026?

Oliver Brewer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Sure, Martin. It's still obviously uncertain. But if the existing rates hold, it would be a little more than double this year impact next year.

And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Chip Brewer for any closing remarks.

Oliver Brewer
President, CEO & Director

Well, thank you, everybody, for dialing in. We appreciate your interest and look forward to updating you again in February when we can talk a little bit more about 2026 and including new products. So look forward to that. Have a great rest of the year and holiday period.
