[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.

Ross Seymore
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Matt, I appreciate all the details you gave about how to think about next year. If I run through those numbers, basically, it sounds like you're implying somewhere around $10 billion in revenue for next year. So I guess, first of all, is that in the right ballpark? And then back in June, you gave a longer-term target for fiscal '29 for your business, especially on the AI side of things. How does what you're looking for next year gets you aligned to those long-term targets?

Matthew Murphy
CEO & Chairman

Yes. Thanks, Ross. I think that's actually a great way to tee-up the Q&A here. So yes, a couple of things. I think you're absolutely in the ballpark when you add up the numbers I gave you on $10 billion for next year. And I think that's a great target, actually, by the way, that -- motivational for us as a team to go drive. And just as a reminder, this is just based on the Marvell organic plan, no M&A contribution. A couple of things about next year, an then I'll actually give you some commentary on how you think about that slope we're on for next year. Another thing I would note, I didn't say in my prepared remarks but we do expect sequential revenue growth next year, every quarter. So year-over-year, we see a nice growth throughout the year. But I would say the second half of the year stronger than the first and with, I think, a really, really compelling exit rate to fiscal '27.

Now it's a little far out to go all the way to '29, let's say, but let me just give you a path sort of on where we're headed and how we think about fiscal '28 and how we build on that strong second half we see next year. So a couple of things maybe to talk about those same businesses. So first on custom. And just as a reminder, I mean, basically, we quadrupled that business from calendar '23 to '24, we doubled it from founder '24 to '25, we're saying it's going to be up about 20% this next year. But then when I look at the year after with all this goodness from XPU attach plus a new meaningful XPU socket ramping and the other programs continuing, we see the custom business action in fiscal '28 doubling off of '27. So we see a reacceleration big time in that year. And that puts us on a nice trajectory towards our growth targets fiscal '29 in custom coming off a strong second half next year and then in fiscal '28.

On interconnect, look, it's early, but we do expect that business should continue to outgrow CapEx. It's done that for a long time. Look, if you just said, hey, 20% CapEx growth in fiscal '28 and nobody knows what that number is, but just peg that in there for now, we'll definitely grow above that. I would say our customer forecast support a much higher number than that. But just as a base case, just assume CapEx is 20% that year. And so -- so optics will grow faster.

And then for storage switch and the other part of data center just assume 10% growth in fiscal '28 over '27. I think that's a reasonable set of assumptions to use based on what we see. And so when you actually add all that together, you come up with a number, bottoms up, which looks more like 40% growth in data center in fiscal '28. So that's what I was talking about in my lead-in, which was strong data set -- 45% growth basically this year in data center, targeting 25% next year and then 40% the year after. And if you actually look at it over like the cycle where we started back in calendar '23, that's like a 50% kind of compounded growth rate, we'll be growing our data center business. So the '28 numbers I'm laying out for you are not totally crazy.

And then just for reference, if you just sort of plug in comms and other growing at GDP for fiscal '28 just to keep it simple. Again, it's too far out you basically get Marvell growing like another 30% in fiscal '28, which would be above where we're looking for '27. So kind of a long answer, but maybe what's been on a lot of investors' mind is how do you get from where we are to where we're going, but certainly, we're very optimistic about our outlook over the next couple of years.

And then things like Celestial AI and some of these other big growth drivers, those are going to kick in starting in fiscal '28 but then really in '29 and '30 and beyond. And I think through the end of the decade, it's looking very bright for Marvell. Thanks for the question.

Our next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.

Harlan Sur
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats on the Celestial acquisition. Today, Matt, your lead AI customer announced their next-generation 3 nanometer AI XPU product. And I think you just said you have secured purchase orders for this program for the entirety of next year. But your lead customer also preannounced their next-generation 2 nanometer XPU product today as well, which we believe you're also involved with, especially now with the Celestial team. I remember at the June custom AI event that the team talked about concurrent design programs. In other words, at the same time, you're towards the tail end of your customer's 3 nanometer design. You're already starting to work with customers on their next-generation 2 nanometer designs.

During our fireside chat in September, you talked about the team being heads down focused on 2 nanometer designs. You even talked about next-generation A16 and A14 technologies. Can you just give us an update on your sub 3 nanometer design win pipeline does include both XPU, XPU attach programs? And what's the time line for these programs to ramp into production?

Matthew Murphy
CEO & Chairman

Yes. Thanks, Harlan, for the question. And yes, just in the spirit of customer confidentiality and details, I can't go into too much. But what I would say, which is incorporated into our numbers is that our product transition from where we are today with our lead XPU customer to the next one is baked into all the numbers I gave you, and yes, I got the backlog and I got the orders and we got great visibility there.

On the 2 nanometer, very exciting. I mean there's a number of programs that we're working on in this area, and that's going to be a workhorse process technology for us. But same as I said, and I would just say that the design funnel keeps increasing there. And the power benefits you see are compelling. And I think that will continue. I mean that's really where AI has sort of kicked in to keep the Moore's Law train running is really the just the power savings are worth real OpEx dollars when you can save power dissipation from one generation to the other. So nothing really new to report there other than just heads-down execution and do see strong product ramps coming over this time period I gave you, especially in the fiscal '28 where you'll start seeing some of the 2 nanometer products ramp. And my team internally just to give them a shout out is executing extremely well. The whole team you saw that got up there at the AI investor event in June by engineering leadership, executing extremely well across the board on the core IP, the nodes, the packaging, you name it. So we're really firing on all cylinders internally. Thanks, Harlan.

Harlan Sur
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great execution.

Our next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.

Tore Svanberg
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. Congratulations on the acquisition. I had a question on Celestial AI, Matt. So when you gave those $500 million and $1 billion target, would that be for the PF Link products only? Or would that also include some of the potential businesses with memory?

Matthew Murphy
CEO & Chairman

Yes. Yes. A couple of things to note, maybe at the highest level. The first is, yes, the revenue targets and also the earnout that we're all going to drive for is all based on Celestial AI in totality. Now the reality is from a lead perspective, the PF chiplet is sort of what's going to go first. But everything is on the table, and there's just tremendous activity that, that team has driven, punching way above the weight in the industry in terms of the engagements they have. So those are all in numbers but clearly going to be driven more from the PF chiplet side in terms of the revenue build in end of fiscal '28 and then the end of fiscal '29.

Our next question is from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research.

Christopher Caso
Wolfe Research, LLC

Also a question about Celestial. And with that revenue ramp that you're expecting at the end fiscal '28, beginning of fiscal '29, can you talk about the breadth of that? And obviously, I'm sure you're not willing to name the customers right now. But is it a fairly narrow customer base, what's the -- and going over time, how diversified is that revenue stream?

Matthew Murphy
CEO & Chairman

Yes. No, great question, Chris. I think that the engagement is certainly broad but remember, we're -- there's a bold effort across the industry to really bring this product into volume stable production, and it's going to take real big companies and a few of them to do that. And so yes, we have strong engagement across the board, but there will be -- and we're fortunate with this that we have -- as I said on the call, we have one Tier 1 hyperscaler that's -- we're engaged with on this that I think is a great partner and a great teaching customer and a great way to -- great customer to collaborate with to really go make this happen. So it's very exciting to see Celestial come into Marvell because -- just as a reminder, we have an incredibly strong internal silicon photonics organization. I mean this team that we got from Inphi pioneered this technology. We drove it into high-volume production and market leadership in the 100 and the 400-gig ZR business, now 800 gig. It's all the DCI stuff they enable. That's on the back of very, very innovative silicon photonics technology.

So we have a ton of know-how here. So then when we bring in Celestial, we're all going to benefit from that common set of learnings and then having a lead customer pulling us through is very exciting. So I think this is just the first phase here, Chris, that you're going to see. But certainly, the interest is there across the industry. And this is just so evident to us over the last couple of years and really pronounced at the last strategic review. It's a process I run every year where we do our capital allocation review with everybody, and I was a couple of months back, and we're just staring at this just giant transition to photonics inside the data center in that TAM. And we looked at, could we do it ourselves, could we do it with the partner and we just concluded this is a home run to bring them in with our internal team plus really a lead customer to pull us through the first wave. But beyond that, we see very broad adoption beyond that time frame.

Our next question is from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.

Harsh Kumar
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Congratulations, Matt and the team and a lot of good things happening. Matt I had two. So I'll just ask them both together. The first one is on custom. You specifically mentioned at least 20% growth for next year. Seems like you've got a lot of good things happening, a lot of good stuff ramping. And I was hoping that you could book in that number for us. So at least 20% to me seems like that's what's in the bag. But maybe you could give us a sense of what -- if everything worked out right for you, what could be a normalized 2027 FY growth rate for custom?

And then the second question was you gave us a lot of color all the way to FY 2028. And this is kind of not the norm on Wall Street, most companies go out a quarter, as you well know. So my question is, and this we've been getting from a lot of investors already is, what is your comfort level? And what is the visibility on some of this long-term revenue materializing that you're talking about?

Matthew Murphy
CEO & Chairman

Yes, sure. A lot in there, but let me unpack it. I think the first is, you should definitely model the 20%, and I think that's -- that is a good number. That's a good safe base case number. And remember, it's a handful of programs today. So I think I would just go for that now. Clearly, we're going to be ready if people want to do more, but I am also mindful of some of the history on this custom business where either people got ahead of themselves or there's a lot of noise in the system and it's just -- look, we've got strong backlog, we got that covered. That's great. If we do better later, we'll definitely update you guys. But we got a very, very good outlook for next year in that business. And then obviously, the year after it really builds.

And kind of part of your question is it's not 20% sort of linearly, meaning the second half, especially in custom and the exit rate is much higher than where we are now. And that's simply because we're building all this momentum into fiscal '28.

And then yes, on the sort of guide quarter at a time, that's definitely been our MO historically. I think given the multiyear cycles we're looking at now in the AI infrastructure build and also, quite frankly, just being sensitive to investor feedback about looking at some pretty ambitious targets we've set for the company several years out. And then wondering, well, how do you see yourselves getting there? And I just view it as it's incumbent on me to paint the picture for folks and share what I see as kind of base case assumptions, as I mentioned.

I mean these are what I view as the base case, not dream the dream, not putting anything in that we -- is sort of a maybe. I think it's very rational how we came up with our fiscal '27 outlook and even our fiscal '28 if you just look at it, bottoms up on the custom, we should definitely be able to do that because we know those programs. I mean if I say CapEx is growing 20%, it certainly may do better, and our optics business is growing way above CapEx, so that has some legs to it.

And then look, even in a quarter, that other category in switching and storage and other has also floated up. So there's still a lot of goodness out there. But I think just from a modeling perspective, that's what you should think about. And I would say, finally, it really though is tied to our customer planning. I mean they're realizing to go get all this build to happen. They've got to provide visibility several years out. That's giving us increased confidence in our outlook because we're having to plan around that. Our R&D schedules, our capacity, our ramps, all that stuff has got to go kind of 6 to 8 quarters out now to really be ready. So that's also part of why I felt it was worth sharing this perspective for investors. And again, I think it's timed well as well with Celestial because then that thing just kicks in beyond the time frame I'm talking about fiscal '29 -- I mean some of it in fiscal '28 but then early '29, '30 and beyond. So hopefully, that was helpful. Thank you so much for the question.

Our next question is from Blayne Curtis with Jefferies.

Blayne Curtis
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I want to ask you, Matt, I know it's always tough to talk about customers, but you did file an 8-K and it says you graded Amazon a warrant for 1 million shares to buy photonic fabric. So I guess, one, very simply, is that your lead customer? And if you can maybe talk about that expanding relationship, obviously, there's been a lot of back and forth your status to the customer, but this seems like a positive in terms of your engagement for the next generation?

Matthew Murphy
CEO & Chairman

Yes. And great job checking out the EDGAR website, Blayne, you're always one step ahead. Yes, I think it's great. So first, we did file Form 8-K talking about really an extension, if you think about it to the warrant agreement we have, which is effectively adding a new swim lane. I mean if you can believe it was only 1 year ago that we announced with AWS a warrant and strategic arrangement with them. Back then, a year ago, it was really bucketed between AI, custom products and then networking products. And so think of this as just adding another swim lane of photonic fabric products to the mix.

And all in, the potential of each of these is quite significant. So that's a positive on the first one, that's out there. Also pleased to get a very, very strong support in our press release for the acquisition from AWS that was positive. And so when you sort of look at all the things we're saying and all the data that's out there, you can sort of figure out where we're headed with this and who is helping drive this technology forward. We're very, very excited about where we can go with this technology, especially with our lead Tier 1 hyperscaler but then also the rest of the market, which I think will be shortly behind them once we can really put the full force of Marvell behind this.

So thanks for catching that and giving me a chance to talk about it. It's pretty exciting to see. Really, if you think about it, we've got the warrant agreement, we got an aggressive earnout that the team is driving, which is a $2 billion number, by the way, through the end of fiscal '29. So all this adds up to just a great sort of set of incentives for everybody to go execute like crazy and bring this into production.

Our next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.

Vivek Arya
BofA Securities, Research Division

Matt, I had 2 kind of questions on the data center, one on optics and one on custom. So on optics, why correlated to cloud CapEx? Why not do growth of AI accelerators, which is expected to be much faster than the 30%? And then on the custom side, you mentioned 20% as the baseline growth. Is that because the second customer is supposed to come on board? Or is it because you will grow with that first customer?

And I ask about the second customer because they don't have a history of ramping, big ASIC program. So I just wanted to get your overall views on optics and why correlated to CapEx. And then on the custom side, just kind of puts and takes of the second customer that's supposed to come onboard.

Matthew Murphy
CEO & Chairman

Yes. Thanks, Vivek. Yes. So on your first question, I mean, just the rationale was just to give just a broad proxy to the investment community about how to think about our business of sort of a very common metric, which is CapEx. I agree with you. The optics business is fundamentally driven by AI and AI acceleration. And that's why it's been growing so far above CapEx each year. And -- but I think this was just in the interest of providing some pretty broad brush strokes but you should certainly assume that the optics piece is tied to AI which is growing faster than CapEx. So that's a fair assumption.

But just this was really in the spirit of making this a proxy. And then on the growth next year, yes, that's all still driven by -- the way to think about it is mostly our current business today. So there's a product transition with our lead customer from one generation to another in there. There's some XPU attach that's kicking in, in the second half that's going to lead to the '28 and '29 revenues I was talking about.

But the next bigger XPU customer we have, not much of that really you should count on for next year. It's really the year after and that's captured in the doubling from fiscal '27 to '28. But I think we've got a very rational base plan for that, that we think is achievable. And then obviously, if things improve or get better, then we would up those numbers. But I think what we're trying to do right now, Vivek, is just paint a very rational, clear picture for people, and then we'll obviously update along the way more on a granular basis as we go forward. .

Our next question is from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna.

Christopher Rolland
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Congrats on the results. So I think your main competitor in ASIC has moved to providing racks, not just silicon. And then with this acquisition and kind of given the increasing complexity we're seeing out there, might you be moving to systems and then perhaps even rack-level solutions as well? And do you have the capabilities to do that?

Matthew Murphy
CEO & Chairman

Yes. Thanks, Chris, for the question. And I would sort of answer the second part, which is, we are very much looking at this as a rack-level solution in totality and that is all the various flavors of optical interconnect. I rattled through a bunch of those. We're the one-stop shop, right, from AECs, traditional DSPs, retimers, LPOs, photonic fabrics and then scale up and scale out switching and XPU attach sockets and circuits to make all this work. And then working closely with our customers with that vision on how we enable that entire end-to-end and enable them to do that.

That's our current strategy. And most of the people we're working with have that capability themselves today. They're very good at it but we also add quite a bit of value in how to think about how to pull it all together. So we absolutely have a rack scale vision, and this is where Celestial AI really fits in. But we don't have any system-level revenues comprehended in anything I've talked to you about over the next 2 years.

But certainly, from a strategic standpoint, it's imperative, right, that we go to market in a very comprehensive way, Chris, and not in a point solution way, but rather be able to provide all the fundamental pieces right from the biggest XPU chip all the way down to a retimer on the board.

This was our final question for the evening. I'd now like to hand the call back over to management for any closing comments.

Matthew Murphy
CEO & Chairman

Yes. Fantastic, and thanks for all the great questions, and I appreciate everybody listening. I know it was a lot. I think this was the world record for the longest prepared remarks I've ever done. But like I said at the beginning, settle in, because there's a lot of good stuff. And there really is a lot of great things happening with Marvell.

I'm just really pleased with how our team has executed. I want to say thank you to all of them. we have a phenomenal setup for next year, as I indicated, and even through the next year, we just have very good visibility. Programs are on track. We are playing offense in this company, okay? We're out doing strategic acquisitions like Celestial AI, and we're thrilled to welcome them to the Marvell team. And I think our future is very bright where we're headed. So appreciate everybody's interest. I look forward to follow-up conversations and appreciate all the investor interest in following Marvell and our journey. Thank you, everybody. Have a great day.
