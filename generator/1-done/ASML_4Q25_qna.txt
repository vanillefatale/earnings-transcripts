Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first questions come from C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald.

Christopher Muse
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

So I guess first question, trying to better understand your outlook for calendar '26. Based on your EUV bookings, it looks like you're entering the year with about 114 Low NA-tools and your implied guide is about 56, give or take, Low NA. So is this a function of lack of certainty around the precise timing of clean room space adds? Are you facing challenges in sourcing lenses from Carl Zeiss? Are you seeing extension of lead times? Would love to hear your thoughts around those moving parts.

R.J.M. Dassen
Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board

Yes, C.J., indeed, I think it's a number of the things I just called out, right? So obviously, we are ramping during the year to accommodate the demand is there. but the demand is also a little bit dependent on the progress that our customers are making in terms of the completion of their fabs during the year. So that's an important element in the bandwidth, if you like, of the guidance that we provide. So to a large extent, it's driven by that. It's driven by our ability to execute and to continuously ramp or move rate quarter-on-quarter. Those, I would say, are the most important drivers of the corridor that you just alluded to.

Christopher Muse
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

Great. And as a follow-up, I guess, on the High NA side, is there any change in terms of your vision for revenue in 4 to 7 tools in calendar '26? And then more importantly, how are you thinking about adoption? Do you think there's an opportunity for follow-on High NA orders in the second half? And could we be surprised by seeing DRAM adopt sooner than logic?

Christophe Fouquet
President, CEO and Chair of the Board of Management

Well, I think there's no major changes compared to what we discussed last quarter, C.J. So I think that in terms of adoption, I mentioned it, we continue to see good progress at both DRAM and logic customer. I think some of our customers are even starting to play with limited product wafer to see the performance of the tool, which is a good news. We still expect a lot of those qualification data collection to last most of the year, which means that when it comes to decision for insertion new order, we indeed look at the second half of this year, 2027.

On the question if it's going to be DRAM or logic first, I think -- well, it's a bit of a neck-to-neck race right now. So hard to say. We see really good progress on both and the appetite to test the technology, I would say, in the coming months, sorry, on -- again, on product in both DRAM and Logic customers.

R.J.M. Dassen
Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board

And maybe a final comment too, C.J., because you referenced, I think, 114 tools in the backlog, if I understood you correctly on EUV. I would tell you, I think that's a little bit on the high end at EUR 25.5 billion of total value of EUV, I think -- and that obviously includes also High NA. You might be a little bit on the high end of your unit number there.

We are now going to proceed with our next question. And the next questions come from the line of Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo.

Joseph Quatrochi
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I guess I wanted to just go back to the 2026 kind of revenue growth guidance. If I look at the range between 4% and 19% growth, what type of those variables, I guess, are ASML controlled versus your customers controlled?

R.J.M. Dassen
Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board

Joe, I think I just said it, right? I mean it's obviously to a very large extent, driven by the progress that our customers are making in completing the fabs and their ability to take in the tool. So that's a significant one in terms of whether the demand falls in '26 or whether it falls a little bit beyond '26. And then, of course, there is our ability to execute, but it all starts with our ability -- with the ability of our customers to get the fabs in order and the episodes in order in due time. So it's a bit of a combination of both, I would argue.

Joseph Quatrochi
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. So I guess just maybe as a follow-up, just can you remind us just how do we think about the manufacturing capacity capabilities in terms of just like the number of Low NA EUV tools? I know you've had some targets out there from some Analyst Days previously, but maybe just an update there.

R.J.M. Dassen
Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board

Yes, Joe. So what we've done, and this is the way we talked about it in the past, we have put in infrastructure such that we can respond, let's say, within a 12 months or a little over that to demand. So that means that what we call the long lead time items, anything that takes a lot longer than, let's say, 12 to 18 months, that is in place. So we have a clean room in place. We have the equipment in place et cetera, et cetera.

So now what we're doing based on the stronger demand signals as we've gotten them in the past couple of months, now we're ramping up our capacity. Now you will appreciate you won't move from 44 EUV tools in 1 year to -- I'm just throwing it out -- 80 tools in the year thereafter, right? So obviously, that's a gradual process. And that's the process that we're doing. So you will see us increase our move rate quarter-on-quarter. So training -- getting the people in, training the people, et cetera, et cetera. And in that way, quarter-on-quarter, you will see an increase on the move rate, and we will do that hand-in-hand with our supply chain. So you will see the move rate increase during 2026. And in all likelihood of what we're seeing today is sustainable. You will continue to see that also beyond '26.

Operator

We will now take our next question. And the questions come from the line of Andrew Gardiner from Citi.

Andrew Gardiner
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Christophe, Roger, you've spoken today about the customers' medium-term plans being revised up. I mean we can see that too in their public statements around revenue growth and CapEx for the coming years. In particular, from your biggest customer in TSMC, you said CapEx will be significantly higher for the next few years. And I mean some of that's quite clearly reflected in the record order intake that you just reported, but also quite clearly, not all of it.

And I'm just wondering in terms of the plans you just outlined, Roger, in terms of increasing that move rate over the coming quarters, how much more visibility are the customers providing you in terms of the equipment needs for next year and the year after? I mean, no one wants to be the bottleneck in the kind of growth that we're seeing in this industry, and I presume that goes for you guys as well, and you must be having those conversations with the customers. So can you give us any insight as to how that visibility is improving into next year and the year after?

R.J.M. Dassen
Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board

I think the public commentary of customers on the sustainability of the -- particularly the AI-related demand that they see on advanced logic and on memory, I think they also share that in the conversations with us. And of course, that also translates into indications that they provide to us either for very concrete orders or what we call from demand. So their indication of how they see the demand develop.

I think the order intake in Q4, I think, is strong evidence of that conversation and that it's not just a conversation, but they're actually also putting evidence and money into that. But they're also talking beyond this year about what their expectations are, I would say, in particular for '27. So our move rate plans that we have also takes that element into consideration. So what they tell us, I think direction is very much in line with what they say publicly. But of course, they also give us a strong indication of how they see their demand develop year-on-year.

Christophe Fouquet
President, CEO and Chair of the Board of Management

And maybe the one thing I'd add to that, Andrew, I think you have to be aware that -- so you have seen indeed our customer moving being far more vocal about their capacity planning. I think this has been also the results of many, many discussions with their customers, which are also providing, I would say, this midterm demand. So what we have seen really in the last 3 months in the alignment between the different parties that on the midterm, as Roger explained, we see basically a strong buildup of demand. And we have got many, many proof of that also in the last few weeks coming out of either logic or DRAM customers.

So I think it took a bit of why to really get to that point. But we really see that happening very strongly in the last few weeks. And I think this is aligned across a large part of the ecosystem.

Operator

We are now going to proceed with our next question. And the questions come from the line of Alexander Duval from Goldman Sachs.

Alexander Duval
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Firstly, on 2026, I wanted to just go back to assumptions for the top end of your sales guidance. I was curious to what extent that would assume that China is meaningfully down. And then going back to the discussion about long-term capacity. You've obviously talked about customers being more confident on midterm demand and the longer-term situation. I think in the capacity planning you've done in the past, you talked about 80 to 90 EUV tools. But if we think very much towards the 2030 time frame, the kind of plans that the customers are talking about would imply something bigger than that. So what kind of lead time would be required for you to push beyond that kind of outcome? And would there be other means through which you could deliver the capacity needed, for example, making your tools more productive by investing in R&D?

R.J.M. Dassen
Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board

So when it comes to the top end of the expectation, when we talk about China being 20% of sales, I would argue that's across the entire range, right? So -- which obviously means that if we're talking about EUR 39 billion, you're looking at approximately EUR 8 billion of China. So I would say that probably, our expectation on China probably moves with that.

If you look at what are the key expectations on the upside of that? Well, a, as we just said, it means that our customers indeed are able to take our tools that we're able to execute on it as we currently plan and probably also that the installed base business is running on all cylinders, particularly on upgrades. Which is not illogical because upgrades obviously are in very high demand right now because it's the easiest, fastest and most effective way for customers to get additional capacity, which in the current market is obviously very, very important to them. So those would be the key elements that I would say that would drive that. And in that model, you could also envisage a China market at 20% of that total sales number.

When you talk about the long-term demand, let me make a few comments and then Christophe, maybe you can weigh in. First, you should not forget that when we get to the 2030 time frame, obviously, at that stage, yes, we're looking at Low NA, but we're also definitely looking at High NA. And the Low NA tools that we would be providing at that point in time would, of course, be Low NA tools with, again, a higher throughput than what we have today.

So back to your question on R&D, absolutely. We will continue to push the road map on our Low NA tools and continue to drive capacity such that per tool, the customers get more productivity than what they get today. But also, at that stage, we expect a more meaningful number of High NA tools that would provide significant additional output capacity. And in that combination, I think the numbers that you were just throwing out I think will provide output capability to customers way ahead of the numbers that we're talking about today.

Christophe Fouquet
President, CEO and Chair of the Board of Management

Yes. I think Roger said it all. I think the way I will summarize it is that we have, I would say, the flexibility to react to the development of the market. I think we talked about mid, short term already. I think it's also true on the long term. And yes, Roger is right. The contribution of High NA, the work, we continue to do on productivity, we already planned for that, will give us even additional flexibility.

So with the step we have done on our capability on EUV, Deep UV in the last few years, which, you remember, we did execute despite the fact that maybe the demand was a bit lower at some point. We have created basically the right flexibility to see the market coming.

Operator

We are now going to proceed with our next question. And the questions come from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen.

Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan
TD Cowen, Research Division

I had 2 of them. First one, Roger, if I try to reconcile your bookings between EUV and memory. Typically, memory has been 30% of the EUV mix. So it looks like a big jump in the memory orders last quarter was driven by Deep UV. Is that fair? And then on EUV for memory, for 1C node DDR5, are we talking about 7 to 8 EUV exposures or lower than that? And then I had a follow-up.

R.J.M. Dassen
Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board

Let me take the first one, and Christophe can take the second one. No, I think the order intake for memory is strong, but not just Deep UV, also EUV. And in all likelihood, if we look at the composition of our sales in 2026, you will see a major memory play in there. So the demand in '26 is far more balanced in terms of Logic versus Memory than it was in 2025. So that's what you see. But this is not just Deep UV, this is definitely also EUV.

Christophe Fouquet
President, CEO and Chair of the Board of Management

Yes. And I think on EUV, I think when it comes to DRAM, I think we are going to benefit both from, of course, the demand for capacity, which we already discussed is very strong this year, most probably beyond that. And we have been talking about the number of EUV layers increasing on DRAM. This has been one of our focus. We have seen that happening in 2025. We continue to see that happening. I mentioned it in the introduction on 6 F-square but also on 4 F-square. And this is a bit of what I would call the perfect storm because when it comes to EUV as a result, DRAM share most probably will increase over time. So this is a very good dynamic on DRAM. Which, again, based on all the work we do with our customer discussion we have, we don't see stopping. So there's still some leeway for more EUV layers for more litho intensity on DRAM for sure. And we should benefit from that in the years to come.

Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan
TD Cowen, Research Division

Got it. Got it. And as a quick follow-up, sorry to get back to this manufacturing capacity. Is it fair to assume your EUV manufacturing capacity is around maybe 70 units? And does that potentially constrain your growth next year? The reason I'm asking is that is your manufacturing capacity limit crossing movement of tools between this year and next year, leading to a wide range of revenue guidance for '26?

R.J.M. Dassen
Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board

Krish, as I said, our capacity is very dynamic because you -- we cannot move from one point to the other, just like that in one quarter, right? So that's why I said we had 44 units -- revenue units of EUV Low NA last year. You cannot go from one quarter to the other even from 1 year to the other from 44 to 80. So we will crank it up. Every quarter, you will see us increase move rate, you will see us increase capacity. And if the demand signals remain as strong as they are, that will continue into 2027 as well. And then I would say 70 would not be the limit that I would certainly be looking at. I think that is higher.

Operator

We are now going to proceed with our next question. And the questions come from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna Financial Group.

Mehdi Hosseini
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

My first one has to do with just the capacity that Roger, you just highlighted. I want to better understand EUV capacity, and the topic that has been around since the 2021 when last time we had the shortages. I want to better understand what are the key factors. As you ramp the EUV capacity, is that going to impact the booking trend? In other words, are your customers actually waiting to have a conviction of you adding incremental capacity before they commit to booking or backlog that will be shippable in '27 and beyond? And I have a follow-up.

R.J.M. Dassen
Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board

No. I don't think, Mehdi, that's what is going on. Customers know what we're doing. We share pretty openly with customers how we're looking at our ability to increase. I think customers appreciate that we've built in far more flexibility into our model than what we had before. If anything, if customers start to smell that for a certain year, you might be supply constrained, actually, the dynamic is the other way around. They want to make sure that they get their booking in before they are too late, right? So as a matter of fact, I would say, if they believe that the capacity might become a choke point, then they will jump to put in the orders. So I think it's more that than that they're waiting for a definitive confirmation that the capacity is there. But we'll very openly share with them what our plans are. And again, they appreciate the flexibility that we've built in and the significant reduction of response time that we have created as a result of creating the long lead time items.

Mehdi Hosseini
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Okay. Great. And I want to go back to the comments in the transcript that was posted with the earnings report. There was a comment that some of the bookings will be shippable in '27. So the question that I have is, what would it take for you to hit the high end of revenue guide for this year? Is that the China? I'm assuming that China backlog has a shorter lifetime. And to that extent, is that the China that is going to impact your ability to hit the high end of your revenue guide range?

R.J.M. Dassen
Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board

I think I said it. I think first and foremost, it's the readiness of our customers to take tools. I think that is number one. So their ability to complete fab construction, put the pedestals and take our tools. I think that's constraint number one.

Constraint number two, our ability to execute. So I just talked about what we're doing to increase the ramp. We're comfortable with that. But of course, everyone needs to sing from the same song sheet, not just us, but also the supply chain. So we got to make sure that everyone is tuned into the same ramp that we have in place. So that would be the second one. So that would be more of a supply factor.

On the demand side, I think it's the demand for upgrades, and I gave some color on that earlier on. And as I mentioned on China, I think in our guidance, China is 20% of revenue. So China would breathe along with the corridor that we have given.

Operator

We are now going to proceed with our next question. And the questions come from the line of Didier Scemama from Bank of America.

Didier Scemama
BofA Securities, Research Division

I'm just asking about 4 F-square and DRAM really. So I think Christophe, you mentioned in your press release that you see in your interaction with DRAM customers that, in fact, DUV and EUV layer count could go up with 4 F-square. So I'm just wondering, obviously, there is a school of thought in the market that 4 F-square would lead to a cliff in EUV demand from DRAM customers whenever we see 4 F-square introduction, say, 2028. So is that a risk that you think is significantly diminishing because obviously, the view is reuse of tool capacity? Or do you think that now as the EUV layer count goes up and there is also a view that now wafer capacity in DRAM is going to have to expand dramatically over the course of the next 5 years because of Edge AI and more complex LLMs, that effectively this risk of a cliff and significant reuse of EUV tools is effectively really diminishing dramatically. I've got a follow-up as well.

Christophe Fouquet
President, CEO and Chair of the Board of Management

Yes. I'll try to answer all the points. So I think the first thing to say is, if you look at 4 F-square, the structure require more advanced litho mass. So that's the first thing. So you get basically to look at a more complex structure. And that structure is going to require more lithography. This is why we mentioned that both, in fact, the immersion and EUV will go up.

Now you talk about a cliff a lot. Customers don't like cliff. Cliff are very bad for operation. What customers like is optimized technology over several nodes. And therefore, when we talk about EUV insertion with our customer, of course, the transition to 4 F-square is taken into account because no one wants to buy a lot of tools and be stuck with them. So cliff is never good for a customer when it comes to operation.

And what you see happening with DRAM is that EUV basically has become a very handy tool to simplify processes, to simplify the number of steps, to simplify cycle time -- to reduce cycle time, sorry, and even to bring more capacity because if you have less mask, if you have less multi-patterning, you end up basically with more space in your fab.

So EUV, I will say that the more DRAM customers use it, the more they like it because they get benefit on all those counts. And again, they want to include the cliff. So when we made the statement in our release, basically, it's really out of many, many discussions with customers. And I think that -- well, I don't know if the risk is going down. We never thought that the risk was pretty high, but I think we are very, very confident that, again, litho intensity will grow with 4 F-square, both on Deep UV and EUV. And as I said before, we see EUV number of layers continuing to grow both before and after this transition.

Didier Scemama
BofA Securities, Research Division

Very clear. So my follow-up is on the gross margin side. So I think perhaps one element of disappointments in the guide is the gross margin. And I think you mentioned the mix of EUV, Low NA. Obviously, immersion probably going to decline because of China and then also the, let's say, upgrades business and the sort of milestone payments that might not be as strong in '26. I'm just wondering, if you look into '27, do you think that your mix of Low NA EUV will sort of revert back to what you had said before, which is the majority will be 3800E? Or is there any reason why 3-nanometer capacity expansion will continue to grow into '27? I guess the immersion question on China is anyone's guess. But if you want to have this into an answer, I'm very happy to hear it.

R.J.M. Dassen
Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board

Didier, on the mix for EUV, customers liked our 3800 so much that they took as much as they could get in terms of 3800 rather than 3600 in '25. But of course, we had a number of 3600s that still needed to be completed that we had all the parts for. And those will be shipped in all likelihood in '26. So the '27, mix in terms of EUV should be substantially better. And also, at that point in time, we're probably looking at the next generation. So the EUV mix by '27 should be better than '26. And you're right, that is an important element because if you look at how we plan towards the 56% to 60% gross margin in 2030. It's pretty clear that new generations of Low NA EUV are critical in that regard. So the EUV mix in '27 will be better than it is in '26.

Another mix effect that is in there indeed is on the Deep UV side. So quite a bit more dry rather than immersion. I would say, in all likelihood that is less a matter of demand, but it's supply, right? So on the supply side, we are constrained in terms of immersion for 2026. So it's in that result that with higher dry business and restrictions on the immersion side, that gives you a less favorable Deep UV mix that goes into the equation. And then an important swing factor because you still have a 2% bandwidth in the gross margin. An important element of the swing factor will be installed base and will be upgrade business. That gives you the moving parts, Didier.

Didier Scemama
BofA Securities, Research Division

No, that's great. By the way, do you want to say what you think will be the rev rec on High NA in '26? Rev rec on High NA. The amount of High NA units.

R.J.M. Dassen
Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board

Probably a bit more than we had this year, but I don't want to go into too much detail there.

Operator

We are now going to proceed with our next question. And the questions come from the line of Francois Bouvignies from UBS.

Francois-Xavier Bouvignies
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I have one for Christophe and one for Roger. I mean, the first one maybe is for Christophe on the High NA. I just wanted to get in more details in here. I mean we see the industry moving into a rush in terms of capacity both at TSMC and advanced logic, I should say, and the memory overall. And I was wondering if you have a rush in this capacity, could that delay the High NA adoption? Do you see some risk happening of delay in addition because the industry is simply too busy to add capacity that they don't want to add another risk in terms of transition. So I was just wondering if it's something that's possible?

Christophe Fouquet
President, CEO and Chair of the Board of Management

Well, I think from day 1, I've been talking about 3 phases of High NA adoption with R&D qualification for high-volume manufacturing, then insertion high-volume manufacturing with limited amount of layer and then the whole thing. And I would say that plan always provide basically the time to have a real qualification. So the acceleration you see today on capacity, of course, is on existing nodes that are ramping with known technology, and those nodes will call for the use of the existing product we ship today. So that's one, that's Deep UV, that's metrology inspection as we know it today.

The preparation of High NA for the next node is such that it does leave the time if customers want to use it to insert it properly. So sometimes, maybe some of you could believe that 1, 2, 3 phases is a bit long, but this is, on the other hand, the way to secure the insertion on the node because once the decision is made to use it on the node, they really want to use it. They prepare the mask for it. They qualify the whole process with it. So it's very difficult to change your mind and say, "Hey, I'm going to go back to the whole stuff." So I think customers try to do those things in such a way that they are not too sensitive to either a major acceleration or slowdown of their capacity. So it's a long answer to say, no, basically. So we don't see a risk there.

Francois-Xavier Bouvignies
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Perfect. And maybe, Roger, your question -- my question is for '26. I mean, if China is 20% of revenues, if we take the midpoint, it would imply China is down about 20%, 25% year-on-year, which is mainly in Deep UV. And you guided Deep UV flat for '26, which means non-China Deep UV needs to go up by 40% for [ 0 ] year-on-year kind of pool to get the flat Deep UV.

And I remember last year, I guess it's kind of a deja vu, where last year, you said there is a strong correlation between the non-China Deep UV and EUV growth. But when I look at '25, your non-China Deep UV was actually not growing much compared to EUV. You had a big disconnect between the 2. So I was wondering if there was a catch-up somehow from '25 to '26. So just trying to understand why this year, you would see this strong growth happening and we didn't see that in '25.

R.J.M. Dassen
Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board

Yes, Francois, it's a really good question. And indeed, this is what we observed. So '24 was strong. Also on the non-China business, '24 was pretty strong also in the dry business for customers across the board. '25 disappointed a bit. If we look at '26, we see the market come back with our leading customers. Frankly, I think many of our customers are doing what we do, which is you put in the long lead time items, which, in our case, is more the EUV stuff, and you take a bit more flexibility in your shorter lead time items, which is the Deep UV business. I think that's what they've done for a significant part of the year. We actually could see the non-China Deep UV business come back in the last months of the year. And we frankly see that trajectory continue into 2026. So you're right. And that we found the '25 non-China Deep UV business disappoint. That is clearly the case. But we do see a reversal of that trend in the last months of the year and see that reversal continue into 2026.

Operator

We are now going to proceed with our next question. And the questions come from the line of Chris Caso from Wolfe Research.

Christopher Caso
Wolfe Research, LLC

My question is with regard to the expected timing of deliveries within the backlog. And you mentioned a few things in your earlier comments, including customers recognizing that, that capacity may be tight, there is availability of customer clean room space. I'm not sure you wish to quantify how much of the backlog is expected to ship in '26. But would you say that the timing of those expected deliveries is stretching out as compared to what's happened over the past few quarters?

R.J.M. Dassen
Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board

Our expectation is, Chris, that the second half will be stronger than the first half, but I would say that that's a function of what I just said, which is, a, the availability of fast pace of our customers; and b, our continuous quarter-on-quarter ramp of our move rate. So as a result of that, we expect it, for the second half, to be stronger than the first half of this year. That's the way we currently model our shipments in discussion with the customers. But clearly, quite a bit of the order intake that we had in Q4. And clearly, part of the backlog is for '27. That is pretty clear. And it is '27, right? So the majority -- the lion's share of the orders that came in, in Q4, some of it is '26, but the lion's share we use for '27.

Christopher Caso
Wolfe Research, LLC

My follow-up question is with regard to gross margins, and you spoke about that a bit, but perhaps you could clarify what are the headwinds and tailwinds with respect to gross margin for this year? I presume that China is one factor. But what are the factors that cause you to be on the upper end or lower end of gross margins as you go through the year?

R.J.M. Dassen
Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board

I wouldn't say it's China per se. I would say it's immersion, right? So immersion tool is -- immersion is a significant contributor to the gross margin. As I mentioned before, we do expect the immersion sales this year to be below 2025, which is not the result of demand, but it's the result of supply constraints on the immersion side. So that is a bit of a drag.

Then you see quite a bit of dry sales. As we said, we also expect the dry sales, which was fairly low in 2025. We already saw that reverse itself in the last months of the year, and we see that reversal will continue into this year. But dry tools come with lower gross margin. So that's a drag on the gross margin.

On the EUV side, there is a bit of a mix effect because we have 3600 in the year that we didn't have that much in 2025. And then if we have a bit more High NA, then of course, that also comes with a slightly depressing effect on the gross margin. So that's all the negatives.

In terms of all the positives, I would say, higher EUV numbers, right? So we're clearly looking at a significant step-up in the number of EUV tools this year. And that is margin accretive. So that's on the positive side. And as I mentioned, the big swing factor, as I look at it today is on installed base. And to the extent that the installed base will manifest itself in a positive way, high demand for upgrades, which at least theoretically, you could assume to be the case this year with all the appetite for capacity additions that our customers have, that should be helpful on the gross margin. So those are all the puts and takes, as I could see, it's for the gross margin this year, Chris.

We are now going to proceed to our next question. And the questions come from the line of Tammy Qiu from Berenberg.

So the first one is on Logic road map. So over the next few years, we do have A16, A14, A14C and A10. Can you confirm that for every single generation, are we still going to have EUV insertion of a couple of layers or some of the customers are really trying to minimize the incremental EUV layers, please?

Christophe Fouquet
President, CEO and Chair of the Board of Management

Well, so let me try to answer that. So I think if you look at the midterm. So we talked about 2-nanometer. Indeed, we're going to go to A16, which is very similar to 2-nanometer, to be honest. This is not a big difference. I will skip that. We see then basically EUV layers increasing again at A14. As we discussed in the past, most probably 10% to 20%. We see that being even more true for A10, where the structure change could call for even more EUV layers. So that's a bit the view we have all the way to A10.

And in the discussion with our foundry customer, again, there's a lot of focus on that because this is key in enabling their future technology. So that's a bit where we -- what we see today on the foundries.

Tammy Qiu
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

Okay. And I have a follow-up also on the capacity issue. So I remember that back in 2021, you were very clear about you would do 90 EUV tools and that is the capacity we need. Then of course, the unfortunate 2022 happened. So we took a pause of that. And it sounded like today, your capacity addition plan has been more cautious than you were previously. If there is any reason for that? Or just basically after 2022, it's better to take a cautious approach from a capacity perspective?

R.J.M. Dassen
Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board

I think I tried to explain, but I guess I didn't completely succeed on that. So what I said is what we did in the earlier years of this decade is to put in what we call the long lead time items, which means that anything that takes more than, let's say, 12 to 18 months to get done, we did. Right? So we build additional factory. We put in equipment, et cetera, et cetera. So we build clean. So all of the things that take time, we did. So that's good news. So that gives you more flexibility.

But as I mentioned before, you cannot from one year to the other, move from a move rate -- an annual move rate of 44 to 80 in 1 year time. It simply doesn't work because you need to take in people, you need to hire people, you need to train those people, and you cannot double that in 1 year's time. That needs to be a gradual approach.

So this is the process that we're in right now because we also took a decision back in 2022, 2023, we're not going to put in people for an output of 90 because that would make no sense. They would have nothing to do, and it would be very, very costly. So we're gradually moving our move rate up. So does our supply chain, same story there. They're also gradually quarter-on-quarter moving up their move rate. And in that way, we will very meaningfully increase our capacity over what we had in last year. So that's what we're doing.

So we have the structural big investments to get to [ 90, ] and now we're gradually moving our move rate up in order to move our integral capacity to cater to the demand. And we think that our increase in capacity goes nicely hand-in-hand with the completion of fabs by our customers, such that we will not be the limiting factor in them being able to increase their capacity.

Christophe Fouquet
President, CEO and Chair of the Board of Management

Yes, maybe to add to that to second for Roger on that. So I think what we said, back to 2026. So we said that the major factor, in fact, on tool delivery would be the execution of our customer because we have to realize a lot of decisions have been done in the last few months. And this also means that they are extremely active in putting capacity in place, et cetera, et cetera. And in 2026, as Roger said, we can nicely follow basically right now their whole ambition, which is good.

When it comes to beyond 2026, as you know, the lead time on our EUV machine is at least 12 months, which means that as we speak, we are capable to have that discussion with our customer looking at next year, basically. And as we do that, we can adjust basically our planning exactly in the way Roger mentioned it. But so far, if we look at the short, midterm, we are capable to nicely follow basically what our customers are asking for.

So I think I sense a bit some concerns that we may be the bottleneck basically for our customer, this is not the case, certainly not this year. And again, for next year, we have plenty of time to continue to follow basically their demand. So I just want to make that clear. I think what Roger described is the process and the flexibility we have thanks to the investment we have made on our indeed 90 capability for EUV, 600 for Deep UV to follow basically very carefully what our customers are going to need in the next few quarters.

Jim Kavanagh
