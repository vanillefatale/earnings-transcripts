Question-and-Answer Session

Carrie Gillard
Director of Investor Relations

Thanks, Jeff. We will now take your questions before turning the call back to Harley for some final words.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Colin Sebastian at Baird.

Colin Sebastian
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Great. Good morning, and I appreciate the opportunity here. We see that the integration with OpenAI has already begun. So just curious on any initial observations from those transactions. I guess how quickly you'd expect incremental contribution from -- or versus other channels? And generally, your expectations for how volumes will originate through AI platforms would be helpful.

Harley Finkelstein
President

Colin, Harley. I'll take that first call. Look, I mean, if you just look at the sheer numbers outside of even OpenAI, just around agentic in general, since January, we've seen AI-driven traffic to Shopify stores up like 7x. And we've actually seen orders attributed to AI searches up like 11x since that. So the data is showing it's already growing. And we actually just recently did a survey for -- to consumers to better understand some BFCM trends, and something like 64% of shoppers told us they're likely to use AI to some extent in their buying.

But look, we've been building and investing in this infrastructure to make it really easy to bring shopping into every single AI conversation. The fact that we're already working with the leaders in this space should, I think, be a testament to the fact that we want to make sure merchants on Shopify are better prepared than those that are not. It's still obviously very, very early. But what we're really trying to do is laying the rails for agentic commerce.

Now in terms of how that's going to affect Shopify, that's the beauty of the business model. The business model is really -- is perfectly aligned with merchant success. The more money they make, the more money we make. And so the way we think about the agentic channel, like any other channel for that matter, whether it's a marketplace or it's social commerce, is that the more money our merchants make, the more customers they're able to sell to, we're able to obviously share in that upside through the GMV, through Payments. That's kind of the way we look at it.

But in particular, to your question, this partnership with OpenAI around conversational commerce is really exciting. And again, it's just one more surface area that merchants on Shopify are going to be able to service customers.

Carrie Gillard
Director of Investor Relations

Our next question comes from Craig Maurer at Financial Technology Partners.

Craig Maurer
Financial Technology Partners LP

I wanted to follow up on the prior question. One debate we've been having with investors is how, in an instant checkout flow, accelerated checkout solutions might get prioritized in terms of presentment. So I was curious your view on how over time when you have tons of instant checkout solutions available in the market, how those might be prioritized or presented to consumers. And at the same time, how you're positioning as the merchants platform might advantage, say, Shop Pay in that type of scenario.

Harley Finkelstein
President

I mean, look, that's the value of Shopify and these relationships. The reason that we're able to be front and center, whether it's obviously OpenAI or it's companies like Microsoft or Perplexity, is that fundamentally what's most important is that these agentic products have the best brands, the best brands are on Shopify.

Now in terms of the Shop Pay thing, I mean, look, Shop Pay in Q3 processed almost -- I think it was $29 billion in GMV, which is up like 67% year-on-year. It's now processed over $280 billion. So the fact that it is the #1 accelerated checkout on Shopify means it's becoming very popular amongst consumers that are very discerning when it comes to buying from the brands they love, which again are on Shopify.

So our mission is to make sure that merchants and [ Shopify ] are best set up. The way that we bring it to these partners is that we make sure that it's the easiest way for these agentic products to get access to all the brands that the consumers are looking for, but also to do it in a way where the technology stack is really simple. This idea of creating this agentic kit, which allows these partners to plug in, checkout, to plug in our Catalog means that it's kind of a no-brainer to work with Shopify.

In terms of which accelerated checkout they'll use, the more people that you Shop Pay, which, of course, is growing amazingly well, means that we just will have more of an advantage. Now again, this is still very, very early days for agentic. Obviously, we've been planning for this for years now, but we'll see how things progress. But we think Shopify and our merchants are incredibly well positioned here.

Carrie Gillard
Director of Investor Relations

Our next question comes from Andrew Boone at JMP Securities.

Andrew Boone
Citizens JMP Securities, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to go back to the marketing investments and given the fact that MRR is just a little bit complicated at this moment. Can you just help us understand the guardrails and what you're seeing in terms of the efficiency of that spend? And then how should we think about that as we think about next year?

Harley Finkelstein
President

Yes. Maybe I'll start there on the marketing side and then Jeff can jump in to some of the MRR stuff. Look, I think we've said it on almost every single call, but Shopify, we are a growth company, and we are focused on driving merchant growth, which leads and fuels our growth. If we see opportunities to lean and accelerate growth in key areas, we're going to make that decision. But ultimately, marketing is an area where we have a lot of flexibility.

So let me be very clear. We really like this approach. Our investments in marketing are working really well. It's driving merchant adoption across verticals, across industries, across geos. I mean obviously, you're seeing that happen really well right now in Europe. And for Q4, we don't expect any change in the environment. So we're going to keep spending money where it makes sense.

That being said, we have very tight guardrails to make sure that where we spend marketing dollars, we do have the appropriate returns. And you guys have heard us talk about this on the previous calls, where we just see opportunities for us to double down in one particular area or one vertical, we double down on it, we see the payback from that fairly quickly. So we're going to keep doing that. But this is an area -- marketing is an area where we have a lot of levers. And when we do see opportunities, we're a growth company, we want to win.

Maybe I'll hand it to Jeff on some of the MRR side.

Jeff Hoffmeister
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I would add 2 points. One, Andrew, I think as we look at -- and I referenced this a little bit on our call. When we look at our merchant acquisition engine overall, we're very pleased with what it's doing. I recognize some of the noise, as you allude to, in looking at MRR in terms of some levels of comparability. I would point out, and I gave the percentage of MRR, which was Plus versus the remainder obviously being Standard and point of sale.

And when you look at the Standard piece, this was the first quarter where we had sequential growth. We were up 4% the last few quarters. It's been flat, but that's purely a function of the paid trials, because Q3 was really the first quarter where you had a clean sequential comparison, because Q1 was when we were essentially finishing the migration back to 3-month trials. So that was, in terms of looking at Q2 versus Q1, that was not a clean comparability opportunity for you when you look at Q3 versus Q2, it's up 4%.

We're still going on a year-over-year basis. We're going to still have some headwinds until we get to Q1 of next year, because of the timing of the paid trials. But we certainly expect with what the merchant acquisition engine is doing, as Harley mentioned, no change in marketing philosophy, that we feel good about what we can do in terms of merchant adds.

Carrie Gillard
Director of Investor Relations

Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi at Mizuho Securities.

Sitikantha Panigrahi
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

I just want to dig into the enterprise business. Could you talk about the success there in changes to the go-to-market and pipeline there? And then specifically, as you're expanding in the enterprise segment, displacing some of the incumbents, how should we think about the take rate from that segment?

Harley Finkelstein
President

Thanks, Siti. I'll take that question. Look, I mean, just to say the thing, I mean, the enterprise is migrating to Shopify. I mentioned last quarter, some of the largest companies in their respective verticals are coming. Obviously now, companies like e.l.f. Cosmetics or Estee Lauder joining us is -- should tell you that the pipeline that we are seeing is quite incredible. Not to mention brands that we talked about a couple of quarters ago, Michael Kors, David's Bridal, Goop, Mejuri, they're now fully launching on it as well.

So I think it's not just that we're winning the enterprise in one particular vertical. It's a broad spectrum verticals, and I think that strengthens our platform. We're also being able to go after more international merchants now with proper go-to-market in places like Europe, for example, obviously, our core markets, North America, Australia and New Zealand, Canada are still doing very, very well.

But it's still -- I mean, it's hard to say this because I'm mentioning all these great names, but it's still fairly early days for enterprise. I think we are the best positioned to attract merchants while making sure that the existing ones also improve efficiency. This is also we're seeing a lot more partner-led deals. We're seeing Europe and Japan do really well right now. I think a lot of these companies are -- these large enterprise, especially the more -- the older ones, the ones that have been around for decades, they're having conversations in their boardrooms talking about where do we go to future-proof platform, where do we go to make sure that we don't miss out on agentic commerce? And all roads lead to Shopify. So whether it's food or manufacturing or education or even automotive, these are verticals traditionally we didn't go after, and now we're winning them. And we're winning them both from in-house built custom solutions, we're also winning them from some of the larger -- we're displacing a lot of the larger existing enterprise platforms.

And I think it's because of the product and, frankly, on the value side, the price-to-value of Shopify's enterprise product is simply best-in-class. And so we're going to keep winning these larger deals. I'm deeply involved in this particular area of our business. I often am and on the calls with the CEOs of these companies. And what I hear is that they're looking to future-proof their business, they want to sort of have what they call their final migration, and Shopify is that partner for them. So I think you can continue to see some of those incredible brands, consumer saver brands continue to migrate to Shopify.

Jeff Hoffmeister
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And Siti, the only point I'd add, because you referenced the attach rate, one of the things that you see in our enterprise business, of course, is all these brands that Harley talked about, is we have more and more success bringing more and more of these large GMV brands on the platform. That obviously gives encouragement to even more brands to follow behind and continue to adopt all the great solutions we have.

And so I think we're at the front end of the funnel in terms of a lot of these larger enterprises maybe starting with just Payments. But when you look at what we're seeing over time, compare that funnel to how many are also taking point of sale or taking other elements of our business, whether installments, some of the cross-border things we're doing. And so this, in a good way is a multiyear step in the right direction as we continue to have merchants take on, especially the larger merchants, take on more and more products from us. So we feel good about while there's short-term headwinds with attach rate, what that means long term for our business is a positive.

Harley Finkelstein
President

It is also quite interesting to watch some of these merchants, these very large enterprises, first come to us for a very specific commerce component. So they'll come to us really just talk about Shop Pay, or just to talk about checkout. I mean our checkout, obviously, we think, is the best in the world. And frankly, checkout is so complicated. And we've really nailed checkout on a global scale and -- for scale for these massive merchants. But it's so interesting to see them first come to talk to us about exploring, "Hey, we just want to talk about checkout." And then within a couple of weeks, it's a full stack. It's, "Hey, we want all of Shopify now."

That sort of land-and-expand strategy that we've been implementing for the last couple of years, maybe the last 2 or 3 years or so, it's really starting to work out. And it's really cool to see these brands moving from just one thing to saying, "Yes, just give us all of Shopify."

Carrie Gillard
Director of Investor Relations

Moving on to the next question comes from Michael Morton at MoffettNathanson.

Michael Morton
MoffettNathanson LLC

Harley, today, you've talked about product search. Tobi talked about it, changing on the cheeky pint. And I would love to know, I know Shopify has a model you will always be where commerce occurs. But as you see product search changing in conversational commerce, what do you envision happening for the product discovery funnel? Does that compress?

And then in your world over the next several years, how do you see the winners and losers of the e-commerce landscape evolving? Is it more merit focused on brands, as Tobi referred to in the past? Anything on how you see the world playing out, not your product road map, but what you see commerce looking like several years from now, I think, would be really beneficial to investors.

Harley Finkelstein
President

Yes. Great question. We think about this a lot. Let me say this. I think there's going to be different permutations of how agentic commerce will evolve, how conversational commerce will evolve. It's really exciting. We're all talking about it, we're all excited about it. But the way that Shopify and the way that, certainly, Tobi sees it, ultimately, who's really thinking about the vision around our product he's the one that really understands more than anyone on the planet how commerce and, certainly, retail is evolving, is that whatever permutation will emerge, that we have to be prepared for whatever path wins.

That was the same thing when social commerce starts to get a lot of attention or when this idea of it's not e-commerce versus physical commerce, but it's going to be this idea of commerce everywhere. We think that one of the advantages of being on Shopify will be that we are everywhere that commerce is happening, and we always aim to get there first. So in terms of exactly how these conversations are going to happen, what we're building right now are these deep connections to AI agents. So when a shopper asks, it's a Shopify merchant who appears and that is powered by our Catalog. The idea of this Catalog where buyers ask for products and the agent searches millions of items and displays interactive product cards directly in the chat, where the product is robust, it's in real time, it is accurate inventory, localized pricing, [ even if it is ] like smart product clustering, that's what we're bringing to these agentic tools.

And I think in terms of your question around who is going to win on the brand side or the retailer side, the one thing that I will say is this has been happening for years, but you're seeing it now more than ever, is that consumers are really voting with their wallets to buy from brands that they absolutely love. And we've always said that Shopify is the place where consumers go to buy things that they want, things that they have a connection to. More and more, if not entirely, those brands are on Shopify.

The reason that I spend time on these earnings calls and, frankly, all day long talking about all the brands coming on to Shopify is I love the fact that these brands are coming on. It's very personal and it's also -- there's a lot of pride for us at Shopify that the biggest companies on the planet are choosing us. But what I'm also trying to suggest is that consumers' favorite brands are on Shopify, and those consumers, they have a different connection with those brands than maybe they historically did where it was just some sort of staple item.

And so I think brands that have incredible product and incredible brand and incredible connection with the consumer, those are the ones that are going to win ultimately. And we're really fortunate that those are the brands that are on Shopify.

Carrie Gillard
Director of Investor Relations

Our next question comes from Todd Coupland at CIBC.

Thomas Ingham
CIBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I'm wondering if you can talk about your view of the state of the consumer by geography and post tariffs now that we've seen a little bit of data there.

Harley Finkelstein
President

Maybe I'll start with the consumer, and then, Jeff, you can talk a bit about tariffs. Look, consumer confidence for us is measured at checkout. That's the truth. That's what we look at. And on Shopify, shoppers keep buying, they keep returning and demand remains really resilient across channels and categories. So I can only comment on what we see at Shopify, but whether it's the GMV, but like I said earlier, consumers are more selective right now and they're buying from brands they love and those brands are on Shopify. And I think even our Q4 outlook suggests that.

But we're not complacent. I mean this is not a place where we rest on laurels ever. We always monitor these macro factors, whether it's consumer spending, it's household savings, tariffs, frankly, even FX trends and supply chains with a lot of our partners. But the strength of our merchant cohorts are pretty clear. I think quarter after quarter, they're growing faster than the broader market.

In terms of geo, I mean, obviously, Europe is definitely gaining traction for us. I mentioned that in my prepared remarks, which we expect to continue. But again, if you look at consumer [ confidence ] measure at checkout, you saw it through the GMV this quarter, $92 billion. We see that the consumers that care about brands that are buying from brands they love, they're buying them from Shopify stores.

Jeff Hoffmeister
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And Todd, on some of the tariff pieces, on my call -- sorry, on my prepared remarks, I mentioned that there's not been a whole lot of change what we've seen this quarter versus the prior quarters. There was a little bit of a downtick in what we're seeing in terms of merchants and in terms of how they're raising their prices. We've basically been tracking that since April when there was a bunch of tariff changes, obviously, in the U.S. It's ticked down a little bit versus what we had seen before.

Pretty much everything else has been consistent versus last quarter. When we look at the trade routes, when we look at the percentage that is inbound versus outbound in the U.S., when we look at what we're seeing on de minimis, we've not seen any significant impacts on our merchants, at least from what we can tell from the data we have. We obviously put a lot of primacy in our proprietary data. We don't have as much visibility admittedly into some of the P&Ls of our merchants, so we can see from a price perspective what they're doing. Some of them are obviously choosing to, as they think about some of these price levels, pass those on to consumers in some way. And I think others are basically choosing not to do that, and it's impacting some of their own P&Ls.

But you can see this in our GMV, our merchant base remains strong, they're adapting quickly. And we're trying to do everything we can to help them on cross-border. So from a tariff perspective, between the April announcements and then obviously the elimination of de minimis, things have been relatively constant from our vantage point.

Carrie Gillard
Director of Investor Relations

Our next question comes from Trevor Young at Barclays.

Trevor Young
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great. Can you expand upon Shopify campaigns? How do merchants get ramped onto campaigns? How do the economics work? And what do you foresee as the revenue opportunity from that initiative over the next few years?

Harley Finkelstein
President

Yes. I mean, look, I think customer acquisition remains one of the hardest problems that merchants face. We've been working on this for quite some time now. And the way we're sort of looking at it is solving this problem in kind of 2 primary ways. The first is on shop campaigns, which I'll get to in a second specific to your question. The second is on sort of discovery and merchandising enablement, which Shop app obviously plays a role in with helping merchants drive more traffic, increase lifetime value and then Shopify Collective plays a role there as well.

Specifically on campaigns though. I mean, what we're really trying to do is we want to run commerce-native performance ads across these high-intent services. And our strategy has been and continues to be to reinvest any gains we achieved through the ads business back into the growth. We want to ensure our advertising inventory and our scale continues to grow.

And the proof has been really great. I mean we've seen 9x year-on-year increase in budget commitments from merchants this quarter for campaigns. In fact, if you just look at Q3 2024 to Q3 2025, we've actually seen a 4x year-on-year growth in merchant adoption of campaigns. So it's going really well.

And on the product side, this thing keeps getting better and better. We introduced Gross Sales, which is this new default high-reach objective in campaigns. We just shipped an AI-powered ranking improvement, which is showing some really good early results in terms of performance gains.

But net-net, I mean, what we're trying to build with campaigns is the scaled, ROI-positive ad engine that really brings merchants more buyers and also unlocks more brand discovery to connect new consumers. So again, this is an area that we're going to continue to work on. We think that early signs have been good. But we -- whenever there's a merchant pain point, we always much prefer to solve it for them than have them solve it themselves. And I think customer acquisition is one of those that we're going to keep working on, and it's already going pretty well.

Carrie Gillard
Director of Investor Relations

And our last question will come from Mark Zgutowicz at Benchmark.

Mark Zgutowicz
The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division

Harley, on the last quarter's call, you mentioned more to come on advertising opportunities. And if we think about your merchant spending, roughly 20% of their GMV on advertising, is there a longer-term strategy in terms of a piece of that you want? Maybe if you could talk a little bit about that. And then specific to ChatGPT, I'm curious if there are ad rev share opportunities there with -- in the future with promoted or sponsored listings for you.

Harley Finkelstein
President

Yes. I mean I'm not going to talk about any particular economics of any particular deal. What I will say when it comes to how we make money from these channels is we've always been able to monetize when our merchants do better. So this idea that merchants sell more, Shopify makes more, we monetize through GMV, we monetize through Shopify Payments. That will always be the case across any new channel. And any specific individual deal that has additional economics, we're not -- we don't disclose.

To your first part of your question around sort of ads, as I said in the last question, it still remains one of the hardest problems merchants face. We think we can do a better job. We have a ton of data, we have a ton of scale to do this with. The goal here with -- when it comes to advertising for us is that we want to drive greater scale against this opportunity. The way that we do this is we were testing, we're measuring and we're reinvesting to drive really great outcomes for merchants in the future.

I still think it's still in early stages. I'll give you a little nod to the fact that you should tune into our next Shopify edition, if you're interested in ads because we're going to spend some time on that as well. But this idea of focusing both on campaigns and then also focusing on the discovery and the merchandising elements through the Shop App and Collective, you're already sort of seeing quite a few breadcrumbs that we're laying down here to show that this is an area that we think we can add even more value to.

And again, it's one more thing that we do. We want to make sure that the relationship that we have with the millions of stores who use Shopify is way more than simply being just some software provider. We are their partner in commerce. And as commerce gets bigger and more complicated and more interesting, that they can continue to rely on us to be their partner. It's the reason why the biggest brands come to us and it's the reason why they stay with us.

Maybe I think it was the last question, so maybe I'll just spend a quick second or 2 just on some closing remarks, as I've been doing the last couple of quarters here. I just want to kind of say this in case it's not clear, but I hope what is obvious now to all of you is that we are doing exactly what we said that we'd do quarter after quarter. We built AI agent tools last year, now we're partnering with everyone that matters. We built Sidekick 2 years ago, well before any of the hype around that. And in Q3, 75,000 -- excuse me, 750,000 shops used it for the first time. 8 million used it, in October alone, we saw 8 million conversations happen there.

So we built enterprise on-ramps into Shopify almost half a decade ago. And now the Estee Lauder Companies, David's Bridal, Aldo, Michael Kors are all choosing us. We're not guessing the future of commerce here. We're really building it.

And the thing that I'm most impressed with and most proud of at Shopify is that I think we're balancing 3 critical things simultaneously here. You're going to see us investing aggressively to capture these opportunities. You're seeing us maintain profitable margins, I think, that demonstrate our discipline. And you're also seeing us deliver durable results quarter after quarter. And that is compound execution. And I don't think there are many companies out there that can do all 3 at once at this scale, and we are doing that.

So with that, I just want to say thanks for joining the call. And on behalf of Jeff and Carrie and I and the entire Shopify team, we're back to building for our merchants. Thank you so much for joining.

Carrie Gillard
Director of Investor Relations

And that concludes our third quarter 2025 conference call.
