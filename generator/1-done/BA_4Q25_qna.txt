[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Wolfe Research.

Myles Walton
Wolfe Research, LLC

A lot of detail there, Jay, within the context of the cash flow. So maybe I'll start there.

Robert Ortberg
President, CEO & Director

Myles, I'm afraid we've lost you.

Myles Walton
Wolfe Research, LLC

Can you hear me now?

Jesus Malave
Executive VP of Finance & CFO

Yes, I can hear you now.

Robert Ortberg
President, CEO & Director

Please start over the question.

Myles Walton
Wolfe Research, LLC

Yes. Apologies. So Jay, a lot of color on the cash flow building blocks to get to that high single-digit [ex] that guy. Could you just clarify the excess advances in customer considerations, the quantum of those and then the duration by which they normalize? Is that '27, '28 or further out?

Jesus Malave
Executive VP of Finance & CFO

Okay. As I mentioned, Myles, again, the total overall quantum goes from low single digit to high single digits. So we know that in the total. I'm not going to give individual breakout on each specific impact, but I'll give you a little bit more of a directional color. What I can tell you is the excess advances coming in from '25 to '26 as well as the considerations at least in 2026, they're generally close to each other, so almost the same impacts.

The excess advances over time actually will burn down quicker than what we expect on the consideration. So that will take a little bit longer to burn down on the 737 and 787 considerations. Again, when you think about this and take a step back, it's pretty much what I said on the prepared remarks, burning this down all is about the production rates and getting us to the higher production rates over time.

One other thing on 777X, even though you didn't ask me, I colored that as well. And again, that will take us a few years. Key thing there is, while it is a higher cash burn this year, it will improve over time with it turning positive in 2029.

Similarly with BDS, that -- that's actually coming down and improving from '26 over '25, and that will burn down over time as well. So again, it's all predicated -- our improvement plans is predicated upon our delivery plans. We've got a very good line of sight, which is why I walked you through this detail. But as things potentially change, these could change as well. And so we'll give you more color.

2026 is a big, big year for us. As Kelly mentioned, we had to get through our certification programs. We also have rate ramp increases as well. As we get the learnings and get informed by those events, that will give us a little bit more ability to really zone in a specific quantification as well as the timing of these. But hopefully, this works for you for now, and then we'll give you more color in the future.

Your next question comes from the line of John Godyn from Citi.

John Godyn
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

I also wanted to follow up on free cash flow. The conversation, I think, is really focused on normalized free cash flow a few years out. The $10 billion number, Jay, that's not one that you created. And I just wanted to -- as you spend more and more time thinking about this, I wanted to just give you a chance to kind of revisit that. You mentioned a lot of moving parts at the end of the prepared remarks.

But needless to say, if high single digit is like an adjusted starting point at the end '26 with the benefit of substantially higher production rates that the FAA allows, it stands to reason that the normalized free cash flow a few years out could be much higher, many billions higher than $10 billion. I know there's a lot there, but I'd love your take.

Jesus Malave
Executive VP of Finance & CFO

Thanks, John. Well, let me just start, say first things first. And the first order of business is getting ourselves to this $10 billion, which I believe we are absolutely on the right track. You're right, John. I mentioned -- I think the term I actually used was very attainable in December, and I'm repeating that again today. I went through this in the fourth quarter. I'm very comfortable with our ability to achieve $10 billion.

Again, it's a little bit of a repeatable sequence of events, but we have to get through the certification programs, we have to ramp up on our BCA production rates, we need to see the improving performance at BDS related to our margin profile as well as burning off the prior charges and then continued performance at BGS.

Again, on an adjusted basis, when you look at BGS this past year, they delivered 6% organic growth as well as 18% plus margins. We expect that to continue as well and be a contributor to cash flow. So if you're asking me, can we be above 10%, I think the potential of our cash flow supports to be above 10%. But first things first, let's get to 10%, and we'll talk about how we go from there.

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein.

Douglas Harned
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

When you look at the production ramps that you're focused on, I'd like to understand a little bit more about where you see the bottlenecks when you're going to 47 to 52 on 737, when you're getting to 10 and then ultimately to 12 and 14, I mean what are the hardest breaks to get to? And what are the biggest challenges? And I wanted to highlight one because if I look at back in 2018, when the rate increase was going to 52, Spirit had some very significant issues getting there. And so perhaps you could also address what you may be doing to ensure you don't have those kinds of issues again with Spirit?

Robert Ortberg
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Doug, let me start and break that down. Let's start with the 737 MAX program. As you know, we've gone from rate 38 to 42 as we said. Just to give you a little bit of color, that's actually gone really well. The KPIs look really good. We achieved that effective rate in November and December on the 737 line. Now recognize that November and December heavy holiday months. So now we'll be coming into a more wholesome full months and we need to continue to see stability. But so far, so good.

And as I said, the good news is the KPI still look good. So no deterioration there. Supply chain on that ramp, not a big issue for us right now. And we projected that. As you know, we've got a lot of inventory there. And I actually don't think supply chain is going to be a big challenge for us in the next rate ramp from 42 to 47. But that's where we start to normalize with the supply base in terms of burning off the excess inventory. And as we've said, going from 47 then to 52, that will be where we'll have to see improved performance from the supply chain. And we've got time we're working that diligently with the supply chain.

Right now, nothing says we can't do that, but a lot of work yet ahead of us. And again, I think -- it will be a tougher rate ramp to go from 47 to 52 than say it was to go from 38 to 42 because of that inventory level.

You mentioned Spirit, so I'll address that right now. You're right. In that Spirit, we're going to need to continue to invest in the capacity growth from Spirit. I think this is one of the big thesis and underwrites why we made the acquisition so that we can guide that ramp and help them move forward. I think if they had continued in a distressed environment, I think that risk would have been significantly higher than our ability to go manage that. But that, like the rest of the supply chain moving to that rate, Spirit has some work to do, and we've got a plan to go accomplish that.

If I switch to 787, as you know, we don't have the large inventory levels there on 87. That is more normalized with the supply chain. And we're working to stabilize at this rate 8 now. And our plan, as we said, is to go to rate 10 here in the next year. There's no particular supply chain constraint that I see there. We still are dealing with seat issues, that's less of a constraint to our production output, but more of an issue with deliveries. And so particularly, for airlines that are taking a new seat configuration that requires a new certification baseline. Those have typically been tough to get through the cert programs, both with EASA and the FAA.

And so we're still working through that, but that's no change from what we said before. I think that's going to be with us for a little while going forward. So I think the top-level story here is that we've got these rate increases in front of us, the 42 to 47 will stabilize here at 42. We'll use the same process we used to move to 42 to move to 47. We'll have a rate review with the FAA and then we'll go ahead and increase that rate. And the same is true on 87 as we go to 10.

Now longer term, as you know, we've invested both in the expansion of another line on the 737 MAX up in Everett, and I commented on that in my prepared remarks. So capital is all in place. We're going through the process of training up the people and that's really important as we move past the 47 rate that we have that line up and running. And then likewise, to move past 10 a month rate on 87, we believe we need to have additional capacity in Charleston, and we've made a major capital investment and kicked that off our groundbreaking here last year.

So our plan is in place. We're working it. I think in general, we're going to see supply chain harmony has to happen in that 47 to 52 rate, we'll continue to work that with the suppliers.

Your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.

Sheila Kahyaoglu
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Maybe if you could just talk about the momentum and momentum is very clear. How do we think about BCA margins? Jay, you mentioned Spirit is about $1 billion, and the comment about delays not affecting pricing going forward potentially as much in the $10 billion future free cash flow state. So I guess, how do we think about 37 and 87 cash margins in the near term? How much they're depressed longer term as well? And then relative to history?

Jesus Malave
Executive VP of Finance & CFO

Thank you, Sheila. And you're right. Right now, 737, 787 cash margins are depressed, and that's reflected in our free cash flow. We do assume and expect and given what's in the backlog that those will improve over time to support these cash flow types of numbers that we're talking about.

The Spirit impact itself, correct in terms of the cash flow impact of $1 billion negative this year. And we've looked at that and we've played out their impact and their contribution to our cash margins on 737, 787 program and forecasted that out. And we don't believe over time, that, that's going to materially impact what we believe and what we need to deliver on these types of cash flows.

So over time, there Spirit's performance will get better, that will be reflecting the financials through just productivity, through synergies in higher quality and delivery performance, as Kelly mentioned. We do have what we would expect over that time period as well as a boost from pricing. And so we haven't really focused on that as much, but that will provide a boost to our margins in the out years as well. And so that is what gives us the confidence that what we've seen here at Spirit, what we're absorbing at Spirit, doesn't really alter what we're expecting in these out years.

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Baird.

Peter Arment
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Jay, just maybe sticking with BCA. The BCA team had a really strong delivery year in '25. I think you mentioned 447 MAXs and you had 88, 787 deliveries. And with the rate breaks that we're seeing this year, maybe you could just level set us on kind of 2026 delivery expectations for both the MAX and the 787 programs and also just maybe any cadence that we should expect first half versus second half?

Jesus Malave
Executive VP of Finance & CFO

Sure. Thanks, Peter. So let me start with the 737. Our expectation for deliveries on that program is around 500 aircraft. And if you look at it kind of if you compare this year to last year, last year in the 447 that we delivered, we delivered around 55 aircraft out of inventory. So our production rollouts are going to significantly improve. This year, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've only got one left carryover going in. So our production performance and rollouts is going to increase substantially.

When you do the math, as you indicated, Peter, in terms of just taking a look at the assumption for rate breaks, you might get into around kind of, call it, 530 aircraft or so. What we're going to be doing in this production build is building around 30 aircraft on the 737-10. Those will not be delivered in 2026. They'll be delivered in 2027 upon certification. And so that would bridge between higher expectation and 500.

As far as the 787, a little bit simpler there. We're expecting around anywhere between 90 to 100 aircraft, and that will be dependent upon really our production rollouts. Again, just like 737, we had about 20 aircraft that came out of inventory that we delivered in 2026 and so the production rollout system will be the primary source of our deliveries, again here in 2026. So a very similar type of approach there. Overall, we expect BCA delivers to be up -- deliveries to be up close to or approximately 10% all in. And so again, that will be driven, I mean, led by the 737 and 787 programs. I hope that gives you the clarity you need.

Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan.

Seth Seifman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Maybe if you could talk a little bit more about defense. We saw a charge there for the first time in 2025. But it sounds like it's something that can perhaps help in the future. Maybe you could talk a little bit about how KC-46 to the extent that you see it turning the quarter, how is it turning the corner?

And then moving beyond that, the state of BDS and maybe how you prepare for some of these production increases that the Defense Department is looking for? Should we think about a multiyear contract for Boeing on PAC-3 seekers? And how do we think about the investment associated with that?

Robert Ortberg
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Good question. So first of all, let me just say that the charge we took on the tanker in this quarter doesn't really reflect at all on any of the other BDS programs. It's a discrete charge against that particular program. And in fact, it's -- the predominance of the charge is increased cost on the actual 767 commercial airplane production as Jay outlined.

And look, we took a look at the program. It is taking us more resources to make the deliveries. We delivered 14 tankers in 2025, and we are planning to deliver 19 in 2026. And we made the conscious decision that we needed to keep resources at a higher level to assure that we make those deliveries on time. As you know, the Department of War is super focused on us, first of all, making investments to support growth and also ensuring that we're delivering on time. And so we took that decision, albeit a big gulp to have to take a charge here on the tanker program. I think it will pay off in dividends with us in terms of allowing us to make sure we meet deliveries -- the 19 deliveries next year.

The other thing I'll just lay out is, as you know, the Air Force has made a decision to go sole source for the follow-on tanker contracts. We will be pricing that in the fall time frame according to the current schedule. So we are laser-focused on making sure we understand the cost base of that airplane. Obviously, this has been a bad contract for the last decade, this existing contract. And as we enter into a new opportunity where we get to reprice, we want to make sure that we, as Jay has said, underwrite that contract to ensure it's a fair contract and we can make money on that.

As I look at the broader question about increasing in rate or increasing an investment from the executive order and the Department of War, look, we've invested ahead of contract on F-47. I think it was a key part of our win strategy, and I think the department clearly recognizes that we went out at risk and made significant investments. We have also invested in the PAC-3 capital to increase the PAC-3 production line. I suspect we will get to a multiyear similar to what you've seen elsewhere with the government on the PAC-3 contracts. So we're in discussions now with the Air Force on that.

So I don't see a big step-up in CapEx relative to that multiyear PAC-3 because, for the most part, we've made the major investments already going forward in terms of CapEx. The rest, finishing the F-4 7, investment is probably our major capital investment here going forward in our defense portfolio.

Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America.

Ronald Epstein
BofA Securities, Research Division

A broader, bigger picture question for you. We can just nail that on some of the financial details with Eric after the call. But -- so you've been at the company now for well over a year doing God's Work, running around, fixing things. But here's the question. It's an effective duopoly with you guys and Airbus. I mean there's some folks on the fringe, but it's really the 2 of you guys. And it seems like on a very fundamental level that -- it's just not a very profitable industry. It seems like everybody else is making money on planes from the guys doing seats, faucets, engines, aftermarket parts, even nowadays, even airlines.

But it just seems like building airplanes isn't that profitable. And you've been on both sides of this, right? So you're at an OE now and you were on the supply side. Can that change and like on a future airplane, can that change? Like what has to change to like really make this industry shine?

Robert Ortberg
President, CEO & Director

Well, look, I think as you point out, I have been on both sides of this. So I know how you can make really good margin in this aerospace market. And I see how you cannot make a very good margin in the aerospace market. And I think the fundamental is we have to get a handle on what risks we're taking and understand the risks. And I think building an airplane is not an easy task. There's significant risk. And we'll continue to take the risk.

The issue that I think we've got to improve upon is how we manage ourselves through those risks and how we enter into contracts associated with knowing that we've got these risks out there. So concurrency, how we price things, what damages we accept, how we do that, I think, are all opportunities for us to improve. And I think a new airplane program gives us that opportunity. For the most part, there's not much we can do about what we've got at hand other than fix our performance, and that's what we're doing day in, day out. I really can't change the structure of the aftermarket and OE construct. It kind of is what it is.

I think this is a big part of the discussion and our strategy going forward for next airplane is where is the value? Where is the value chain? What do we do? What do we partner to do? And how do we assure that we're participating? There's a lot of value in this commercial aerospace market. You're right, we should participate in that -- in the value.

So that's a lot of work for us to do strategically. I don't see any impediment to do it, but we've got to understand the risk we're taking when we take them and make sure we've got plans to manage those risks. And if they go unmitigated, then you end up with situations like we're in, where we don't -- we're not sharing in the profitability of the overall market. That would be my take.

Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Vertical Research.

Robert Stallard
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Kelly, again, a strategic sort of question for you. Given the recent geopolitical volatility, are you worried about a return of tariff risk at BCA this year? And similarly on the defense side of the business, a longer-term shift in Europe to more local procurement.

Robert Ortberg
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Rob, I wouldn't say worried is something I have to -- we have to continue to watch. As we saw last year, this is super dynamic, right? It could change tomorrow. But I think if you step back from all the dynamics day in, day out, look, I think the -- at least the U.S. administration fully understands the importance of commercial aerospace to the economy -- to the U.S. economy. They've been very supportive. And we've worked through what initially looked like some pretty hairy tariff environments to resulting in pretty good outcomes.

So I think we'll be able to continue to focus on that. And again, I think this administration is fully supportive of this industry. It's not going to do things that caused us a major harm.

Having said that, as we saw last year, we were shut down for a little while in deliveries into China. That got resolved and we got the deliveries done. We do have about the same number of deliveries this year into China as we had last year. So we got to watch these trade barriers. Certainly, we have a lot of deliveries into Europe. So watching how that whole negotiation plays out, to ensure that we don't get in a tit-for-tat environment on commercial airplanes. Something we're going to have to just continue to work. But again, I'll just say, the administration has been accessible to us, has listened to our concerns when we've had them. And I think we've ended up with pretty good outcome so far.

Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.

Noah Poponak
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Jay, I know you don't want to -- I know you're not quantifying the pieces of the free cash bridge you just gave back to normalized. But I guess I wanted to try to ask, is the total of those pieces greater or less than $7 billion because you have commented on most of those in the past. And if I take the midpoint of [$1 billion to $3 billion of $2 billion] and add all those back, it seems like more than high single. So I don't know if you're netting out some positives or if I'm just missing something? And then what is BCA cash if you exclude the abnormalities and you were just basically just 737 and 787 price cost, is that generating cash in your 2026? Or is that closer to breakeven?

Jesus Malave
Executive VP of Finance & CFO

So Noah, let me just go back to your first question here on these items. Again, you're talking in that range going from low single to high single, kind of, call it, $6 billion to $7 billion in the aggregate. Don't forget in my prepared remarks, what I talked about was the benefit of excess inventory coming down over time. So that is a mitigator.

The only thing I'd say is the DOJ payment is a onetime event that occurred here in -- is occurring here in 2026, and that just doesn't repeat. It's not something that draws down in any way. So that's the best way to look at it in the aggregate between that $6 billion and $7 billion.

As far as BCA cash, look, what I'll tell you there is that we continue to expect that, that's going to improve -- the cash margin is going to improve in our programs, as I said previously. And it's a key enabler to our cash flow getting to $10 billion in the -- and I think as it becomes necessary or we have the visibility, we'll give you more there. But I think I'm going to stop here giving you what the directionally what it needs to be.

And your final question today comes from the line of Gavin Parsons from UBS.

Gavin Parsons
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Jay, I think you're restricted from looking at all of BDS previously. So have you been able to get under the hood of all those programs at this point?

Jesus Malave
Executive VP of Finance & CFO

Yes. Let me just talk about -- I mean, just -- as you're right, I was restricted through the end of the year, and I started here in January, doing reviews with BDS. And I think I need to put some context in there because again, I think there's some expectation that I'm doing some kind of an outside the process, EAC kind of deep dives to kind of circumvents the processes that we have already in place. And I'm not doing that.

What I am doing is really reviews with our programs as well as my first reviews where we're just with the BDS business in the aggregate. And it's really focused on 3 things. One is there's just a strategic element to it. One is an operational element and then third is the financial element. And just kind of give you a little color about that is, as I look at program to program, it's trying to understand -- making sure I understand the capabilities being delivered, developed for our customer, understanding the relevance of that capability today and what that means in the future, just strategically.

Looking at our current backlog and our delivery profile and how that fits our customers' capability requirements and whether or not we're meeting that mark. Operationally, looking at program status, things that -- are we on track schedule-wise, things that don't necessarily translate into directly into our financial, but think about earned value type metrics. And just so understanding, get myself baselined on the programs, where they are strategically, where they are operationally and of course, a review of EACs, but more in the context of, again, baselining what needs to happen? What are our key assumptions in those? What are the risks? What are the opportunities? How do we realize the opportunities and how do we mitigate the risk.

So I'd call it a little bit higher level than some type of EAC deep dive. To the extent that something pops up in a review, then we'll follow up with that. And I would expect that to occur -- continue to occur throughout this quarter as well as the rest of the year. And that will basically convert and transition over to the normal reviews that we do, the team does with Kelly and the rest of the leadership team. So it's more of a holistic view. If there's anything on a specific EAC or anything like that, that will be handled through the regular EAC process and go up from there.

So just to give you a little bit of color in terms of how I'm approaching this. And so far, it's been a great experience. The team is doing a great job. As Kelly mentioned in his remarks, they're improving each and every day. And again, they're heavily focused on driving to the customer requirements and meeting their schedule and budget requirements. So a good start on my BDS intra indoctrination.
