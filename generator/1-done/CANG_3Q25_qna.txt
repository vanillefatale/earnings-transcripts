Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Emerson Zao with Goldman Sachs.

Emerson Zhao

I have 2 questions. Number one, given the current Bitcoin prices, will the company consider selling Bitcoin holdings to fund new business expansion or manage market risk or support operation needs?

And the second question is, you mentioned that equipment operates improved energy efficiency. But we see October operational hashrate, which was 46.6 exahash, which is still below the deployed hashrate of 50 exahash. So what are the main factors behind this gap? And when do you expect full utilization?

Yongyi Zhang
Chief Financial Officer

Thank you for your question. I think I would take the first one. This quarter, we continue to follow our mine and hold strategy, retaining all mined Bitcoin as part of our strategic reserve. We've seen a heightened volatility recently, driven by tight market liquidity and increased uncertainty around the U.S. rate cut parts. However, we believe the fundamental thesis for Bitcoin as core reserve assets remain intact under broader macro spectrum. We will take a flexible approach across that equity and other financing channels to support our development of our new initiatives. Our Bitcoin reserves also provide a meaningful liquidity buffer and optionality for structured financing if needed.

Peng Yu
CEO & Director

Thank you for your question. I'm going to answer the question regarding the operation efficiency. After completing the acquisition of 18 exahash in late June, we reached full scale operations at safe for the first time in July during the initial integration phase we experienced temporary downtime due to cross state machine relocations and ongoing power system commissioning at the newly acquired sites. This factor created a short-term pressure on our time.

Our operations team responded quickly and throw system-level optimization uptime has now stabilized about 90%, which is considered industry-leading and demonstrating the strength of our operational capabilities. It is important to note that external factors such as experience weather and great curtailment periodically affect minor availability. This is an industry-wide reality and achieving 100% uptime is not visible. Among comparable industry peers uptime about 90% is regarded as a strong performance benchmark.

Going forward, we will continue enhancing efficiency through upgrade to our intelligent operations and maternal system while replacing low efficiency, however, will improve plant.

Our next question comes from Pingyue Wu with Citic Securities.

Pingyue Wu
Citic Securities Co., Ltd., Research Division

This is Pingyue from Citic Securities. And I have 2 questions. The first question is related to the debt structure. And the company mentioned converting short-term debt into long-term debt. Can you elaborate on the financial benefit of this shift? And what is your current cost of debt?

And secondly, my question is related to CapEx. Some capital-intensive data center operators have undergone significant value reset. Some people are questioning whether AI CapEx is entering bubble in territory. Given that you are now entering into the AI infrastructure space, how do you view this risk?

Yongyi Zhang
Chief Financial Officer

Thank you for your questions. And I will take the first one. Through this optimization of our debt maturity profile, our liability now primarily composed of long-term borrowings. This better aligns our capital structure with our strategic strategy of building big oil reserves through self-mining, enhancing balance sheet stability and reducing financial risk. At present, we plan borrowing costs remain in the 7% to 8% annualized range at this level is expected to remain stable following the maturity structure adjustment.

Peng Yu
CEO & Director

Regarding the second question, I think it's true that the market is reassessing returns on AI investments, particularly for hyperscale data centers with high leverage heavy CapEx and long contract cycles, but the demand level, AI influence and industry-specific applications are still expanding rapidly the demand mix may evolve, but long-term compute demand is not appearing.

In turning later, gives us the benefit of observing market shifts and avoiding high leverage expansion at the end of the previous cycle, our advantage slicing a lighter asset and leverage structure and a more distributed edge-oriented operating footprint. We evaluate and monitor AI project investments, potential returns and cash flow profiles at every stage. This allows us to dynamically adjust course, optimize capital efficiency and preserve strategic feasibility at all times.

Our next question comes from [ Joey Chai ] with [ Wujen ] Securities.

Unknown Analyst

I have 2 questions as well. The first one, Bitcoin has pulled back sharply from its all-time high in October. How does this affect your operating pace for Q4 in 2026. With your current cash position in BTC Holdings, how long can you operate under extreme market conditions? And do you have a worst case plan? And the second one, the Georgia site is self-owned and this contradicts the asset-light model. Will future expansion favor on the sites or leased sites?

Yongyi Zhang
Chief Financial Officer

Well, thank you for your questions. Yes, we conduct frequent internal stress tests. And thanks to our asset-light models and operational flexibility we can dynamically adjust and even shut down high-cost sites on the extreme scenario to reallocate harsh power and control operating expenses. And we have the flexibility to adjust our BTC Holdings strategy as needed. We focus on long-term return per unit of harsh power as a long-term economics of Bitcoin rather than short-term market noise.

Peng Yu
CEO & Director

Regarding the Georgia side, it's important to clarify that. Today, acquisition is not a strategic bet, but rather an upgrade of our SLI model, we choose to acquire the site because it aligns with our long-term needs around securing low-cost power, gaining great stability and deepening our infrastructure operations capabilities.

Looking ahead, we will continue to follow a balanced model of lease first with selected selective strategic acquisitions. These things will remain our primary path for rapid expansion and geographic diversification we evaluate potential acquisitions against strict criteria, power cost, stability for AI grade data center upgrades and regulatory stability We believe only a portion of 3 sites is essential to maintaining long-term cost advantages and supporting our strategic transition.

On capital allocation, we prioritized efficiency over share scale. All cash flows will be direct to first to initiatives that strengthen our structure cost advantages such as acquiring sites to lower power costs or upgrading underperforming compute equipment. At the same time, we remain disciplined in managing our asset structure, evaluating and monitoring leverage and financial discipline through ranges, financial and operational metrics.

And our next question comes from Kevin Dede at H.C. Wainwright.

Unknown Analyst

This is [ Daniel Malin ] on for Kevin Dede. We're curious how Cango feels it's best to address the HPC market, whether that be through cloud compute or a power shell model. And if the recent pullback in Bitcoin could it all accelerate this? And how are you guys thinking about time lines with those 2 ventures?

Peng Yu
CEO & Director

Thank you for your question. In AI compute, Cango is taking a differentiated approach instead of building large centralized data center. We focus our black for distributed compute units in practice, this will integrate dispersed GPU resources into standardized compute pools and break them into smaller units tailored to the needs of small and midsized enterprises. This approach is enabled by 2 core advantages; our distributed operational expertise and our global energy footprint, allowing us to execute a unique SLI first strategy.

Operator

Thank you. That's all the questions we have time for today. And this concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.
