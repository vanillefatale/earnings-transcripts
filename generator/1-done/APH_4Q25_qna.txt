[Operator Instructions] We have a question from William Stein from Truist Securities.

William Stein
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the very strong results and outlook. First, I'd like to ask about the bookings, which was very strong. I think you highlighted a 1.31 book-to-bill. Adam, that I imagine must have in it some extended duration orders in the backlog. And I wonder whether that's entirely concentrated or mostly concentrated in IT datacom. And also, if you can talk about what gives rise to that level of orders. Is it based on sort of a need for them to place this in order to get in line from a sort of a lead time perspective? Or is this based perhaps on sort of minimum order requirement in order to meet CapEx requirements that you have? Any color on that would be really helpful.

R. Norwitt
President, CEO & Director

Well, thank you very much, Will. Look, no doubt, we are very encouraged by the bookings as we came out of the year in 2025. And I'll say a couple of things. I mentioned earlier that, in fact, our bookings were really broadly strong across all of our end markets with maybe, I think, only one exception, our book-to-bill was at or above 1 and in a few cases, significantly above 1. And -- but there was certainly the IT datacom market and specifically related to AI investments was a primary driver of this 1.31 book-to-bill and record orders for the company to achieve orders of more than $8 billion in the quarter was certainly a milestone for all of us.

Look, I think that, as I mentioned, and I think Craig alluded to, that we have seen customers open up their order window for -- in particular, related to significant plans that they have of investments related to AI. This is not because of kind of getting in line, so to speak. I mean I think our team has done a fabulous job of ramping up. I mean, as evidenced by the extraordinary growth that we achieved last year, 124% year-over-year growth for the full year in IT datacom. There's no doubt that our team has done an amazing job of ramping up to our customers' needs. But at the same time, and we've talked about this in the past, because of the technology involved in a lot of these next-generation products, really pushing the limits of these systems and pushing the limits of the products, these products do require, in certain cases, more automation, which fortunately, we do the vast majority of that in-house, which has been an amazing competitive advantage for Amphenol through this time period.

And so we've worked with customers because of these sometimes outsized investment requirements and their outsized plans that they provide to us to somehow share the risk of those investments. And we do that in a variety of ways. Those ways can include customers actually sharing some of the spending, contributing to the spending and otherwise, giving us commitments that are solid commitments that give us the comfort to make those investments and drive the ramp-ups that ultimately meet those customers' demands. And so I think it's more not -- and you used the word minimum order. I wouldn't call it minimum order, but rather it's giving us the comfort through their own commitments to Amphenol that we should then make the commitments in capital and using Amphenol's hard-earned cash and the time of our teams to make those investments. And I think it's a great sign. It's a sign, number one, of our customers' intentions and their plans, which are very robust. It's a sign number two of our customers' commitment and confidence in the Amphenol organization. And so no doubt about it. I think it's a positive, and we look forward to continuing to drive great success in that market in the future.

Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore ISI.

Amit Daryanani
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Adam, post the CCS deal, can you just talk about the breadth of your offerings when it comes to serving these AI infrastructure customers? You folks have done really well on a stand-alone basis, but there's this view, I think, out there that Amphenol is driven more by copper. And as we move more to optics and fiber, there's a risk here. So maybe hoping you can spend some time to help us appreciate the range of offerings you're going to have post CCS? And how do you see these offerings that you get from CCS really being complementary to what Amphenol has today?

R. Norwitt
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Well, thank you very much, Amit. Look, there's no doubt about it that we have worked for a long time, and it's kind of ironic. We just celebrated the 20th anniversary of another foundational acquisition for Amphenol, which was the acquisition of the Teradyne Connection Systems business 20 years ago, which really catapulted Amphenol into a leadership position in high-speed copper interconnect products. I will tell you that at that time, high speed meant 5 gigabits, maybe 10 on the outside. And over those 20 years, we've continued to double down on the excellent capabilities that TCS brought us, the people, most of whom are still with our team today, there to celebrate that same 20th anniversary. And that has put us in a real leadership position as our customers drive their systems to higher and higher speeds.

Now we have always been a player in fiber optics. I mean, going all the way back to the early foundations of what a fiber optic connector was half a century ago or more. But there's no question that with CCS, just like at the time with TCS 20 years ago, CCS vaults us into a position of breadth and depth in the technology around fiber optic interconnect that is a real expansion of our capabilities. And so when we go to customers and we talk about data center applications or when we go to communications networks customers and talk about their next-generation network planning, we can now have that conversation across the entirety of the interconnect spectrum. As they think about the various trade-offs that a customer goes through every time they think about their specific system architecture, do they want to use a high-speed copper interconnect here? What's the power situation? How do they bring power into their system, into the rack, into a data center, into a network? And then how do they use fiber optics, which have, of course, fabulous traits, in particular, around high-bandwidth, long-distance communications.

And customers are making these trade-offs every day. And now with the CCS acquisition, what I'm so excited about is the unique position it puts Amphenol in as a company to be able to go in and talk to that entire spectrum of interconnect. Our customers just want to get a signal from a place to a place. And it's up to us to work with them to figure out the best way to do that, whether they're getting a signal from a GPU to a GPU or from a central office to a home somewhere or anything in between. And I think now we were able to come to them with a total solution of leading interconnect products that ultimately allow us to be -- have a seat at the table as a partner with those customers for many, many years and many generations to come.

Our next question comes from Luke Junk from Baird.

Luke Junk
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Adam, maybe to bridge on the comments you just made. I'm just wondering if you could maybe speak to integration first steps at CommScope. And like you mentioned, the deal got closed a little sooner than you had expected. Just how important is that in terms of bringing this new fuller, broader portfolio to bear in data center, especially given how quickly this market is moving right now?

R. Norwitt
President, CEO & Director

Well, thanks very much, Luke. Look, I'll answer the second question. I mean, you get one of these deals done, you got to get a lot of approvals in a lot of different places. And I think our team did a great job of working with the various authorities to get those approvals a bit faster. And I'm really grateful also to the folks who sold us this company, and they've renamed our company now, and I wish them all the best. It was really a great experience, I think, for all sides. And we worked really well together to bring this deal to fruition quite a bit faster than we thought it was going to be at the time that we originally announced the deal.

I would say -- so the speed, I don't think the fact that we closed it early in the quarter versus the end of the quarter, that doesn't change our position in the marketplace. Obviously, as soon as we announced the deal, you can imagine that our customers around the world were -- wanted to talk to us about what that meant for the long term. And so we've been having those conversations for quite some time already.

In terms of the integration, I mean, that word integration is not a word in the Amphenol lexicon. There are two words we don't use, integration and synergy. And -- but what we do talk about is letting them evolve into the Amphenol family, letting them be who they were because it's a fabulous organization. I mean the leadership of the company is still the same leadership. The people are still the same people. We're not parachuting people in. We're not merging and morphing things into one or another, synergizing and restructuring. We're actually working with the team on day 1 to say what are the opportunities that now that you're part of Amphenol, you could hope to achieve that you maybe couldn't have done as part of your former company.

I was so happy on the first day of the acquisition that right after we announced it, I went to really one of the nerve centers of the company. As you know, the CommScope, we've talked about this. In many ways, it is a collection of extraordinary iconic businesses in its own right, the CommScope business that was founded nearly 50 years ago by Frank Drendel as a supplier into the broadband networks market, the Systemax business, which is an amazing iconic business selling into building connectivity and the ADC Communications, which was a long legacy leader in fiber optic interconnect. And so I was really happy to go to Shakopee, Minnesota, where -- which is really the nerve center of the fiber optics capability of this company and meet with these engineers and the product managers and the folks leading that business. And I can tell you, they're so excited to be part of Amphenol. And we broadcast a welcome around the world and just a kind of almost a universal excitement to be part of this company called Amphenol to become Amphenolians, as they all now know that word. And so the first steps is meet the people, get excited, find opportunities to go accelerate the business, and that's all well underway today.

Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.

Wamsi Mohan
BofA Securities, Research Division

Adam, I was hoping you could maybe parse the first quarter IT datacom guide of flattish organically, excluding CCS. Within that, should we be expecting the traditional sort of enterprise-centric market, double-digit decline and the AI workloads to grow? Is that the right way to think about it? And within the AI context, is that more programs for you, more units in existing programs? Any color you can share around sort of what you're hearing from your larger AI customers in terms of just trajectory given especially your comments about very strong orders?

R. Norwitt
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Well, thanks very much, Wamsi. Look, I mean, it's hard for me to give too much of a parse of what that flat organic means. I mean you're correct. Traditionally, the base IT datacom cycle would be down in the first quarter. So I think probably there's some of that here as well. But look, in terms of our ongoing growth in AI, I mean, I want to emphasize one thing, which is just the breadth of that business. We have an enormous position with a lot of different customers up and down the stack of AI from the folks who are making the investments, the big web-scale folks and otherwise, including like the cloud, the neo cloud, whatever you guys all call these folks, the equipment manufacturers all the way down to, of course, the significant companies who are designing the chips and the architecture around those chips.

I mean I will say that as we come out of 2025, that breadth is reflected in the fact that we didn't have any 10% customers in 2025. We have significant customers, but we have also a lot of breadth around that business. And so as our customers think about the forward potential of AI, I mean, I think there's a few factors. Number one is their investment plans are all going up. There's no doubt that there continues to be a very robust plan of continuing to drive accelerated computing at a very strong level. And there's upgrades of the technology embedded in those data centers, which requires a higher technology, more complex, higher content degree of interconnect. We're also very excited that not only are we participating as we have traditionally bringing the power in, power to the racks and the like, the data communication within racks, within adjacent racks, but also now with CommScope participating in the broader fiber optic opportunity associated with those data centers. And there's no doubt that, that also creates a strong opportunity for the company going forward.

Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan.

Samik Chatterjee
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Adam, I'm wondering when you mentioned the sort of customers opening up their order books a bit when it pertains to your IT datacom business, are you seeing anything similar for the CCS business? And the reason I ask is we saw one of the competitors in the space Corning announced agreement with Meta securing supply. So are you seeing hyperscalers or customers on that front come to you to sort of engage in those discussions to secure supply? And what that would mean for your investment sort of support for this business?

R. Norwitt
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Well, thank you very much, Samik. Yes. Look, no doubt, we had very strong orders. And I would tell you that the CommScope business, as we call it now, we're not calling it anymore CCS has also had very strong orders. And for sure, I mean, there have been plenty of announcements by really wonderful companies out there, and we're really proud to be considered in the same breadth of some of these amazing companies that have also been in the public eye of late. And there's no doubt that the CCS is participating. I mean we've talked about the fact that their exposure into the data center, the strong growth that they've seen in that area. I would also just point out, at the time we acquired and we announced the acquisition then of CCS, we talked about acquiring a company of roughly $3.6 billion in sales at a 26% EBITDA margin, and that implied a price of just over 11x that we paid for it. By the time we closed, we're now talking about a business of more than $4 billion in annualized sales. That is a great momentum, strong orders, positive books-to-bill and all of that. And obviously implies as well that on -- at least on a current year basis here in 2026, we -- this is a great deal for Amphenol and really the high single digits in terms of an EBITDA multiple. So I think it's a great company with great prospects. And yes, does see those same trends.

In terms of investments, I mean, look, we don't see any significant abnormal kind of things vis-a-vis investments with CCS. But I will say this, and that's something we've talked about in the past, it's a different thing for CCS to be a part of a company that for very obvious reasons, was somewhat balance sheet constrained. And now they're part of Amphenol, where we're more than willing to help them stimulate the virtuous cycle that so many of our companies are on by making prudent investments that allow great returns and allow them to capitalize upon the opportunities in the marketplace. And so it's not that we're just going to give them all blank checks here. But you can imagine that it's a different environment for CCS in terms of their ability to grow into the opportunities as part of Amphenol than maybe it would have been in the past.

Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia from BNP Paribas.

Andrew Buscaglia
BNP Paribas, Research Division

Maybe shifting away from the AI and IT datacom story for a minute. I think another kind of underlying trend this quarter or a positive thing we're seeing is the momentum in a lot of other areas in your markets are pretty beat up. And I'm thinking like industrial, automotive, mobile devices, specifically, just seem to start -- the markets seem to be turning a corner. Where do you say that's most pronounced? Maybe what surprised you in the quarter, if anything? And where do you see some of these sort of battered end markets going in 2026?

R. Norwitt
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Well, thanks very much, Andrew. I mean there's no doubt. I mean, we saw really broad-based strength as we -- through the year and as we finished the year. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're especially encouraged in -- if you take automotive and industrial as two pretty broad global markets that we saw growth organically in both of those markets across all of the territories that they operate in. And I would highlight there, in particular, Europe. I mean the world has been so down on Europe for so long. And I think we've started to see in our company, especially in the second half of the year, that our teams in Europe who have held their heads high through this whole kind of malaise, if you will, and have continued to pursue opportunities to gain market share to enable our customers who are doing really amazing things, driving now robust organic growth in Europe, in automotive and in industrial for the full year. And I would even say that in the fourth quarter, amazingly, our strongest organic growth in automotive was in Europe. So that's definitely a different thing than we've been talking about and that the world has been talking about for some time. And I think we're excited about our continued position there.

And mobile devices, it's a different thing. I wouldn't call that as much of a regional market, but there's just a lot of innovation. Look, I always start the year at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. And I think I even had the chance to run across a couple of you guys who are on the call here today in the lobbies of the Venetian or wherever. And I go to that show always because I find it so inspirational to see what folks are doing. And what I find so interesting is everybody is talking about AI and the build-out of the networks of AI and the capability. But what I find long term, maybe even more exciting or at least equally exciting is what's going to come from that. What's it going to mean that we're going to have this ubiquitous accelerated compute capability all the way to the edge of technology. And when you walk around CES, you see it. Now look, I don't know what is that all going to mean. I personally am not going to be front of the line to buy like an AI-enabled toilet. But will one day as a former fan of Star Wars as we come to the almost 50-year anniversary, will we each have our own C-3PO that will have great AI capabilities? Who knows? I mean these kind of things are possible. And I think the places like in automotive with autonomous driving, in industrial, where you see so many different things happening on the edge where things get smart, robotics and the like, and mobile devices, those 3 markets that you mentioned, I think each of those stand to have a fundamental step function in their capabilities and their potential because of what's happening today in the build-out of this AI network. And I think long term, that's something that I'm really excited about. And I think back on the other revolutions like the microprocessor, the Internet, the mobile Internet and the like. And each of those had later on a carry-on benefit to those markets, automotive, industrial, mobile devices and the like. And I'd be surprised if we don't see something like that in many years to come.

Our next question comes from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors.

Steven Fox
Fox Advisors LLC

I guess I just was curious, big picture, Adam, you've obviously just completed a really strong growth year and generate cash flows. But with the orders now that you're looking at, can you just sort of talk about sort of the management challenges? You mentioned adding more automation. And I'm wondering about like higher metals prices, supply chain constraints. How do you look at this in terms of new challenges, especially as your demand is broadening out?

R. Norwitt
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Well, thanks very much, Steve. Sorry, I didn't save my Star Wars reference for you. Look, the -- this is not an easy thing to do to grow a company by 38% organically. Let alone those operations within the company who have grown by so much more than that. I mean you can imagine we've got folks who have more than doubled the size of their individual operations. But what sets us apart and what has always been the core of why we are able to do hard things is that unique operating culture of Amphenol. The fact that we rely on what is now 145 or so general managers, 16 operating groups. The CommScope, we talked earlier about the "integration." Well, there's not an integration. The CommScope team is -- the person who ran it is now a Group General Manager of Amphenol, and he's running his team as he ran it before.

So the management challenges, and you list a couple of things, supply chain, the cost of metals, which are extraordinary, the geopolitics, whatever, shipping, I mean, there's so many things. And I think we don't fixate on one or another of those things. What I fixate on is making sure that if you're a general manager in Amphenol, you've got all the authority to deal with whatever comes your way. And that empowerment and enablement of people to go figure it out. And yes, if they need some help, we're here. We've got this amazing organization, driving collaboration, communication across the company. But at the end of the day, the buck stops on 145 desks.

And if that means doubling the size of your business, figuring out how to set up factories in 4 different countries, doing things with technology that have never been done before, ramping up automation machines that we've never built before, but now can build extraordinarily, probably one of the world's best automation companies that exist, they make it happen. They make it happen. And so I think when I think about growing the company as we have, doubling the size of Amphenol really in the last 4 years, for me, the biggest singular focus is how do we do that while still preserving that entrepreneurial culture. And I'm so proud that we've done it.

If you think about a big change in the company 4 years ago, which I'm not going to say is the thing that created that doubling, but it certainly enabled it. It was when we moved to 3 divisions with 3 division presidents, when we expanded the number of operating groups in the company, all with the goal of securing, strengthening and scaling that unique entrepreneurial culture of Amphenol. And I don't think it's a coincidence that we took that step 4 years ago. And now here we are 4 years hence, celebrating doubling the size of Amphenol. And so I do believe that the management challenges, which are countless on every day, thousands of challenges that our people face, they're equipped to deal with them no matter what they are. And that gives me not only a confidence for the future, but enthusiasm for the future because whatever comes along, we know for sure the world is not predictable. But what I can predict is that Amphenolians will be there and will make it happen regardless.

Our next question comes from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.

Mark Delaney
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I was hoping you could speak a bit more on the margin outlook. The company sustained a record high EBIT margin again in the fourth quarter at 27.5%. But there's a number of factors as you go into 2026. You have some big deals like CommScope, you also alluded to, but metals are up quite a bit, but then the company is growing quite fast. So any color you can share on how to think about incremental margins this year and some of the key puts and takes?

Craig Lampo
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Mark. Appreciate the question. Yes, I mean, I'll start off by just really quickly addressing metals. I mean, Adam just mentioned kind of a bit about it. But from a margin perspective, I mean, certainly, we're working hard. I mean, metals are certainly something that we have as part of our cost of sales. It's not a significant cost when you kind of take into account the significant value we create within the facility. But certainly, it certainly has an impact. I mean it's like any other cost that we work through and the general managers do a great job of working through kind of offsets to those cost increases through anything from design of products to things in the factory to working with vendors to a whole host of different things. So I wouldn't say that, that, at least as of now, we see having any significant impact on kind of our margin outlook as we're moving into '26 and certainly hasn't had any evident impact certainly with these record operating margins that we've seen here in the fourth quarter and for the full year.

As we move into the first quarter, I mean, the main puts and takes here, I mean, organically, we have a slight sequential decrease in our sales, which is normal seasonality that we typically see during the first quarter. And we're converting kind of in the mid-30s, even the lower mid-30s in regards to that organic change. And that's typical given our profitability levels and kind of where I would expect. So the company is really doing a great job managing a seasonal sequential decrease. And the bigger impact on our margins in the first quarter really is just the impact of CCS. We talked about CCS being in the high teens for the full year and from an operating margin basis, kind of where we expect. I would tell you in the first quarter, just because of the seasonality of their sales and the lower sales in the first quarter that their operating margins are just a bit under kind of that high teens rate. So they're having a bit over 100 basis point impact on our margins in the first quarter.

As we progress throughout the year, we're not guiding in '26, but certainly, we expect normal kind of operating margins. We expect that kind of 30% kind of targeted conversion margins that we target on incremental sales as we grow. And with CCS, again, we target that getting up to over time up to the company average. And certainly, that will be an adder over time to our operating margin potential. So I'm really happy with our operating margins that we've achieved in '25 and certainly very optimistic as to where we are in '26.

Our next question comes from Asiya Merchant from Citigroup.

Asiya Merchant
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Just given the strong order book momentum and the AI momentum that you guys also talked about, just -- Craig, if you could just talk about CapEx and how we should be thinking about investments into 2026 as a result of that? Sorry if I missed that earlier.

Craig Lampo
Executive VP & CFO

No, thanks for the question. No, we didn't talk about specifically earlier. No, from a capital perspective, and as we talked about in 2025, we were certainly spending at a bit higher level. But honestly, with the growth we have seen, we kind of ended the year just a bit over 4%, which is 3% to 4%, we say is our historic range. We ended the year just a bit over that 4%. And I would say, as we go into '26, and we continue to see certainly opportunities for growth. And certainly, we've had these strong orders here we talked about in the fourth quarter. We expect that capital spending to still be certainly at that upper end of that 4% range.

And certainly, we have quarters that certainly exceed that 4% for capital spending into '26. So I think that the fact that we're still spending kind of in our historic range and roughly there is really just a testament to the -- just the discipline of the organization, the ability to spend wisely and really support the growth, the significant growth that we're seeing still with pretty reasonable spending, I think. So -- and I think I would expect more of the same in '26. And as we continue to grow, I think that 3% to 4% range will continue to be that. And I think as we -- these growth rates are a little higher, I would say that we'll be probably towards the upper end of that 4% range, give or take, in the quarter.

Joseph Spak

Just a quick one for me relating to -- circling back to CommScope and that business. I know it's still early days in being the official owners, but any sense of how large their order book looks here going forward?

R. Norwitt
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks very much, Joe. I mean I think I mentioned earlier that CommScope's also had a nicely positive book-to-bill over the recent quarters. And so I think it has a positive order book from that perspective.

Our next question comes from Guy Hardwick from Barclays.

Guy Drummond Hardwick
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Just a quick one on the order book. Obviously, it's a fantastic result of $8.4 billion. Just how do we square that with the Q1 revenue guidance of $7 billion, which obviously, the Q4 order book didn't include CCS, but I assume Trexon. Is it the orders, the window that you talked about? And is that $8.4 billion really kind of a sustainable number over the next few quarters?

R. Norwitt
President, CEO & Director

Thanks very much, Guy. I mean, look, I think I talked about the fact that we have seen customers extend their order window. Craig mentioned that as well. And in addition, as we continue to ramp up for our customers, new programs, particularly related to AI, there is that kind of confidence that we like to get before making investments, that our customers can give us in a variety of ways, including through orders. I'm not going to guide to what our orders are going to be in a given quarter. I mean you can imagine our sales folks are out there trying to pursue every order possible. But these are really outstanding orders, and they will carry through longer than just here in the first quarter.

Our next question comes from Scott Graham from Seaport Research Partners.

Scott Graham
Seaport Research Partners

Congratulations on the print. My question is about defense. Obviously, the current administration's thinking is at some point, we need to push the budget up to $1.5 trillion. Is there any part of your defense sales that are maybe not subject to whether it's just an upgrade, next-gen technologies, the golden dome. I don't know how much -- how closely you've looked at some of the articles that have come out on this. But is there anything that you see that maybe doesn't give you maybe full dibs or most dibs on that? And then on the other side of it, are you concerned at all about the administration's sort of negative rhetoric around with NATO and what that might do to some of your international sales in defense?

R. Norwitt
President, CEO & Director

Thanks very much, Scott. Look, I think as the leader in defense interconnect, I wouldn't tell you that we take that for granted. But do we have dibs on this market? We got dibs on this market. I mean -- and we have that because of a broad array of technologies and deep investments that we have made. I mean the one thing that I think sets us apart, in particular, related here to -- we'll talk about U.S. and then we'll talk global, is that we have continued to double down, number one, on technology innovation; and number two, on scaling our capacity to enable the defense industry to continue to meet the levels that they need to. And so whether that means today's budget or higher budgets in the future, I can tell you that the breadth of our offering, coupled with the depth of our capacity and capability is something that puts us in a really strong position across really all programs. And you mentioned a few programs. Our folks are deep into every program that is involved.

I will also add to that. With the acquisition of Trexon, while only just under $300 million in sales, it really does expand the prominence of our value-add interconnect capabilities which is an enormous additional opportunity and additional growth potential for the company long term. We've always been a leader in the discrete connector solutions, a broad array of them. I mean you cannot imagine how broad that array is. But now being able to support the value-add products across programs, across applications, land, sea, air and everything in between, I think Trexon really rounds out our position and expands the potential of what we can do to support this growth.

Now relative to your question around NATO and international, our approach as a company has always been not to be a sort of U.S. flag in the front of our factory kind of an operation when we operate around the world. We operate 350 factories across more than 40 countries around the world, and we don't have expats period. We operate our company as a local company. So when we're in France, we're a local French company. When we're in the U.K., we're a local U.K. company, in Denmark, in Germany, in Italy or wherever that may be. And that focus on being a local provider in the defense market. And our defense position in Europe is very, very strong. We've had really outperformance in Europe here for a number of years in terms of the strength of our business.

I'm never going to say that you're insulated from anything. But the way that we've structured our company, the culture around our company, how we interact with our customers is as a local partner in those places. And we do that in all of our businesses. That's just how we run the company. But I will tell you that in a geopolitically interesting world that we are in today, the way that we've always operated is a pretty good way to operate in today's world. And I think that will, in many ways, protect us from any politics that could inject themselves into this world. Our customers at the end of the day, want the best product, and they want it at the time that they need it. And if we can focus on continuing to do that and do it locally, I think our defense business has a great future.

Our last question comes from Joe Giordano from TD Cowen.

Joseph Giordano
TD Cowen, Research Division

Adam, you mentioned CES, and I think one of the things coming out of there was an ultimate move at some point towards like 800-volt DC power for data centers, and there's major implications on what that means for copper and what that means for the ability to do things at different dimension and different diameters. Just curious, as your portfolio broadens out and you have these fiber capabilities, what does like the -- if you think through the potential positives and negatives for such a dynamic, like how do you think that nets out for you guys?

R. Norwitt
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Look, I think what we care about, Joe, is that there's more of everything. And so as folks make changes, they go to different voltages, they go to different speeds of transmission, they go to more nodes, they go to more tokens, they go to more density, whatever it is. The ultimate, what comes out of that is more complexity. And so for us, whether it's one type or another, I talked earlier about the fact that we today, especially with the CommScope acquisition, have the broadest offering in the industry and the broadest ability to enable our customers really as they face these really challenging technological trade-offs. And so I think we're in a really great position to be able to do that and even stronger than we were before pre the CommScope acquisition. And whether it's different voltages or different speeds or different densities or all the various things that our customers are looking at, I think we're going to have a great seat at the table working with them to enable these exciting next-generation systems.

Thank you. We currently have no further questions. So I'll hand it back to Mr. Norwitt for closing remarks.

R. Norwitt
President, CEO & Director

Well, thank you very much. And again, I'd like to offer my gratitude to everybody here for taking the time with us today, and we look forward to seeing you in 90 days. And I hope you all, at least those of you who are not too far from us here in Connecticut, I hope you're able to stay warm. Thanks.
