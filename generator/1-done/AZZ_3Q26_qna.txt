Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird.

Ghansham Panjabi
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I guess, first off, on the Metal Coatings segment and also Precoat. Can you just give us a sense as to how your order backlogs have shaped up in context of some of the complications of the operating backdrop with the government shutdown and so on and so forth?

And just specific to the government shutdown, did it have any material impact on you in either of the two segments?

Thomas Ferguson
President, CEO & Director

I think as we've discussed typically on the Metal Coatings side, we really don't have much backlog. We've got -- but we do have a good forward look from our sales organization in terms of what our customers are -- what their outlooks are. So we feel really good at this point as we look at finishing the year. That's why unless weather gets really, really ugly as it did last year, we think Metal Coatings has the momentum and opportunities to have a really good finish to the year.

So feeling really good about that, and it's both as we've mentioned, the big projects, lot of opportunities, whether it's data centers, whether it's solar plants, transmission distribution, a lot of the pulp business and towers. It's just all really active, particularly in a lot of the areas that we've got good capacity.

On the Precoat side, much more of a mixed bag. I think -- didn't feel anything from the government shutdown to speak of on either side just to get that out there. But on Precoat, yes, they're more challenged with residential, commercial construction. They are getting -- benefiting from some of the data centers, a lot of painted metals on those. But -- and then in terms of roofing, it's more than conversions as houses are putting new roofs on. They're more and more of them are moved into metal, which is good for us, but it's not enough to offset the market -- call it the market headwinds. So -- and they don't really have backlog either, but they do have a lot of bare metal, and the bare metal is lower than at this time last year. So they're chasing stuff that's going to be quicker turn to maintain their sales levels.

Ghansham Panjabi
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Got it. And then specific to Precoat, Tom. I mean, obviously, a lot of distortions in order patterns last year with tariffs and the adjustments in imports and so on and so forth. Is the underlying operating environment worsening as we head into fiscal year -- into calendar year '26? Or is it just at a low point and there's no recovery on a consolidated basis given the ups and downs you -- across the business as you called out?

Thomas Ferguson
President, CEO & Director

No. I think you got a couple of things going on, some of which is in our control, some of which isn't. But I think we believe the markets have pretty much bottomed and stabilizing. And so we're seeing opportunities. And of course, we're going after more. We're winning some market share that's out there to offset the market softness.

But -- and then we've got the Washington plant ramping up, and that is one of the areas where we are seeing opportunities in the container. And as we continue to talk about plastics converting to aluminum, that's just -- we probably couldn't have opened up new capacity for the container business at any better time.

So we get pretty excited looking at next year and having a full year of run rate production at the new Washington site. Not to mention we've made some investments and are going to continue making investments at the St. Louis container site. So that's where we are excited, and we're chasing all of that we can find and have a good partner on Wash, MO and then other opportunities with other customers there. So that's where our focus is and then doing everything we can to convince customers to go with us instead of the competition.

Ghansham Panjabi
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Just one final one on -- I know you'll give fiscal year '27 guidance formally in a few weeks. But any sneak preview you can share with us as it relates to the variances that we should keep in mind as we finalize our estimates for next year?

Thomas Ferguson
President, CEO & Director

No, I think -- I think as I alluded to, Metal Coatings, we look at them finishing strong for the balance of this fiscal year. And even though they don't have backlog, they're stacking up some pretty good opportunities as we kick off going into next year. So we're feeling real good about that. Obviously, we've got a budget to get approved by our Board. So we'll do that in about 3 -- well, 2 weeks at this point, and then communicate as soon as we can put something together and get new guidance out.

But yes, feeling really good. I like where we're positioned. I like what our teams are doing. I like the leadership teams we've got in place. And I like what they're focusing on. So I'm pretty enthusiastic.

The next question comes from Nick Giles with B. Riley Securities.

Nick Giles
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the strong results. It's especially nice to see both the buybacks and the debt reduction, but I wanted to go back to M&A. And I was just curious if you could give us some additional color around what kind of opportunities you're seeing out there today? Is it Metal Coatings versus Precoat? Single site or multisite?

Thomas Ferguson
President, CEO & Director

Yes, that's a great question. I think the M&A pipeline is very active. It's predominantly bolt-ons onesie-twosies, which is kind of -- I'd like to say it's in our sweet spot. We acquired Canton and just ramped it right up. It's our typical integration playbook, and bring it right up to our fleet margin levels and go grow it. So those are the kind of things we've got in the pipeline.

I don't see us getting anything closed by the end of this fiscal year. It's just too many things going on and not that we're not focused on it and got some good -- the teams are active. But I'll be really shocked if I'm sitting here on this call at this time next year without a couple of wins on the board in talking about those onesie-twosie bolt-ons, which just -- we'd like to get a couple of them in the camp, or in the family so to speak.

Nick Giles
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

Got it. Well, Tom, that's good to hear. Maybe switching gears. You talked about plastics to aluminum and Washington was extremely well-timed on that front. But aluminum prices have reached all-time highs in the U.S. And I know you don't directly feel the impact of that. You have the tolling model. But your customers might feel that impact. So I was curious if you've seen any changes in demand on that basis? Or if you feel the Precoat business has a sensitivity to aluminum prices?

David Nark
Chief Marketing, Communications & Investor Relations Officer

Yes. Thanks, Nick. This is Dave. I'll take that one. We don't think that there's going to be much sensitivity to the aluminum just because when you look at the container market, in particular, there has been the secular shift to aluminum driven largely by people's more reluctance to drink things out of plastics, in particular, and the concern around microplastics.

When you look at in the quarter, in particular, I think it's underpinned by the results of the segment. Our Consumer segment in particular, was up 11%. And when you take a look at the disaggregated sales. So we feel really good about what we're seeing. Wash, MO is ramping nicely, as Tom mentioned. We've got a great partner there and a lot of long-term prospects that continue to come our way.

The next question comes from Eric Boyes with Evercore.

Eric Boyes
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Maybe first, how impactful to Precoat segment margins might the Washington, Missouri ramp, the 75% exit rate in fiscal 4Q be? And when might we hear about remaining capacity allocation there?

Jason Crawford
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Eric, it's Jason here. I can take that one up. Certainly, as we've previously communicated the margins that we expect from the Washington facility just based on the math of the equation of that product that we're selling are going to be complementary. So it is going to add a lot but tailwind to the margins that we see at Precoat.

In terms of the additional capacity, we're solely focused on our partner at the moment, and ramping up capacity for that partner is coming through the cycle. And we're very pleased with where we're at, but we still got a lot of work to do and certainly a lot of work to achieve here in Q4. So it's really going to be into the early part to the mid part of next year before we really start to focus on bringing additional customers to that facility.

Eric Boyes
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. Appreciate that. And then maybe second, and Dave, I think you alluded to it in the prepared remarks, but can you help us with how we should think about kind of quantifying the benefit of the favorable weather comp in fiscal 4Q?

David Nark
Chief Marketing, Communications & Investor Relations Officer

Yes. As we mentioned, on a high level, when you look at last year, it was unseasonably cold and wet. We had mentioned last year, I think that we lost around 200 days of production collectively in the quarter. So I don't have the specifics in front of me right now, but we do believe that we're seeing better weather so far in the fourth quarter. Today, in Texas, it's going to be 80 degrees. So a far cry better than it was last year at this time. But we can follow up maybe after the call, and I can see if I can get you more detail.

The next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson, Davis.

Adam Thalhimer
Thompson, Davis & Company, Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the record sales quarter. Can you update us on pricing in the Metal Coatings segment? I'm curious also how price might be impacting margins in that segment?

Thomas Ferguson
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We talked a lot about -- we try not to talk directly about pricing, since we do have some competitors on these calls. But when we're chasing large projects and when we talk about transmission, distribution, and solar, and data centers, they tend to be bigger projects, and so it just attracts more competition. So it will -- that's when we're talking about the mix because you're going to have -- not significantly, but you're going to have marginally lower margins on those big projects. And so they formed a bigger piece of our business. And we had opened up to that because we had decided that we were pushing the top end of our margins. And so we've kind of opened up the opportunities.

Let's chase some -- hate to call it chasing the volume. But let's be more open to taking some of that -- those opportunities. And I think it's been good for us because we've got capacity. That's going to help us the balance of this quarter. It definitely helped us in the third quarter. But we're not getting out of control. It's -- we got a tightly controlled process on how we price projects.

A couple of things others that hasn't been talked about, but we do have zinc continuing to go up in our kettles. We tend to push price as those costs go up. And we price it 41 plants on every given day. So I think the teams have demonstrated great discipline and yet going after opportunities with customers to build sustainable momentum. And -- so we're pretty excited at this point about what that team is doing.

Adam Thalhimer
Thompson, Davis & Company, Inc., Research Division

And -- either Tom or David could address this. But I am curious, you guys aren't the only ones talking about the data center is getting bigger in 2026 versus 2025. Just curious if you could flesh that out a little bit for us, and why you're focused more on it today?

David Nark
Chief Marketing, Communications & Investor Relations Officer

Yes. I think as you look at the data centers and in my remarks, I was talking about, we're really excited about the number of opportunities within a data center that we touch. So it goes just beyond structural steel that's used for building foundations, and the structure envelope of the building, and then the related power coming into it.

We do believe that Precoat will see some opportunities as those projects move further along. We've got customers on the Precoat side that make insulated wall panels for instance. And then there's a lot of coat specific work that's driving the need for increased metal and coated metal, whether it's galvanized or prepainted. So that's why we're bullish on the segment. It's a big segment. It's a growing segment and our share within it is expanding as well.

Adam Thalhimer
Thompson, Davis & Company, Inc., Research Division

Good. And last one for me. David, you brought up the metal roofing opportunity. Do you have any idea today what the share of metal roofing is for new construction and repair and remodel versus asphalt?

David Nark
Chief Marketing, Communications & Investor Relations Officer

Yes, we do have some data on that. When you look at sort of the breakout in residential between new construction and replacement, it's just shy of 5% of the new construction market, is now embracing metal roofing. It's gone up about a point -- a full point since 5 years ago. And so we think that trend is going to continue.

And then on the replacement side, it's a larger impact there. It's about 14% of the replacement market today. And growing at a faster rate, driven by a few things. One of them is building coats. It is more resistant to storm damage over time than asphalt shingle and also HOAs, which have historically been a little reluctant to embrace different types of roofing material other than asphalt are now loosening up their standards and embracing that as well. So we're very excited about it.

The next question comes from Daniel Rizzo with Jefferies.

Daniel Rizzo
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Just to follow up on that last comment. Is there a particular region in a country where metal reroofing is more prevalent? You mentioned HOAs, I don't know when I think HOAs, I think of where my parents live, which is a kind of retirement places in Florida and Arizona. Is there any regional mix that's relevant?

David Nark
Chief Marketing, Communications & Investor Relations Officer

Absolutely, Daniel. Yes, we're seeing a stronger concentration of that through the south in the areas that you mentioned. So Florida, in particular, as well as here in Texas, and all the way over to Southern California and Arizona are all markets that generally have a higher concentration of metal roof than in the northern climates.

Daniel Rizzo
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And I may have asked this before, but -- sorry, go ahead, I'm sorry, did you say something?

David Nark
Chief Marketing, Communications & Investor Relations Officer

No, I was just going to say yes, they do well where we got more of a corrosive environment, or you've got a lot of sun. So they tend to hold up better.

Daniel Rizzo
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. Okay. No, that makes sense. And then for the just kind of traditional non-resi construction, and maybe I've asked this before, but what's the lag between when you start to see some easing in credit towards -- a resi starting to rebuild and it kind of translates to demand for you guys. Is it immediate? Or is it like a 6-month lag? Or how should we think about it?

David Nark
Chief Marketing, Communications & Investor Relations Officer

Yes. When you look at it and again kind of taking a look at just some of our sales data, we have seen -- in my prepared remarks, I talked about subdued construction on the non-resi side, and then the residential being down a little more significantly.

So I think that as you move forward through the end of this year and into next year, the fact that there's been some rate movement already should be a positive for the market, and we should start to see the benefit of that sometime here and as we enter into calendar 2026 and our FY 2027.

Thomas Ferguson
President, CEO & Director

And I'd add on the residential side, it's more tracking to mortgage rates. But it's going to -- on a lot of these capital projects, it's a 6- to 9-month lag time in general. So -- and then -- but it's looking at the forward curve. So we're hearing more optimism out there, I guess, I'd leave it at that.

The next question comes from Mark Reichman with NOBLE Capital Markets.

Mark La Reichman
NOBLE Capital Markets, Inc., Research Division

Just focusing on the Metal Coatings business for a minute. So the second quarter, the sales growth was 10.8% relative to the prior year quarter, and 15.7% third quarter year-over-year. And we did see the gross margin go down a little bit, 30% in the second quarter versus -- what was it, 30.9% and 29.8% versus 30.9%. You mentioned chasing these bigger projects, but could you maybe get a little more specific? Are there specific large contracts that kind of drove the big sales increase, and might you expect in 2027, maybe a little more moderation in the sales growth, but maybe a tick up in the margin? Or do you think these big projects are just going to continue?

Thomas Ferguson
President, CEO & Director

No, I think there's a couple of things here. So if you take typical transmission distribution, big poles, towers, it's -- it depends on where it hits -- which plants the project activities act. Some of our plants are built for big poles when projects come in different sections of the -- so this is a very temporary kind of thing. And we've invested a lot in our capabilities and capacities. So yes, as we get into next year, I expect that you'll see those margins hopefully improve as we've got some operational improvement activities.

We've invested in kettle capacity. We've invested in specific things that will help us run some of these kinds of projects, or the bigger projects better. And then we've added more trucking so that we can move things in between our customers and our plants. And pivot things to the plants that are going to be more capable of running certain projects. So a lot of things that we've been doing this year to -- which is one of the reasons we did open it up, and we want to want to continue with that momentum going into next year.

So yes, I would not expect to see double-digit growth quarter-over-quarter going in as we get into next year. I expect growth, and also expect us to be able to handle it with the margin profile, that kind of where we're at plus.

Mark La Reichman
NOBLE Capital Markets, Inc., Research Division

Then so you've done a great job reducing debt and repurchasing shares. Just on the dividend policy, have you kind of announced at a precedent with the increase in the first quarter dividend? I mean, is that kind of what investors kind of expect is maybe one increase per year?

Jason Crawford
Chief Financial Officer

It's certainly, obviously, with the realignment of our debt in the AVAIL transaction in the summer. It gives us the luxury to readdress that and whether it be an annual basis or such like. It's certainly something that's on our radar. It's certainly something that we continue to consider and continue to take a look at. So given that profile, then it's certainly something that we will look at come up for this next cycle.

Thomas Ferguson
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And we are committed to being more regimented about looking at it consistently each year and -- and as we -- this is the time where we are putting the budget together, the plans together and talking about these things with our Board. So the timing is good, as Jason said, but we're committed to evaluating this annually and not having to go several years like it did this last time before we have an increase.

The next question comes from Gerry Sweeney with ROTH Capital.

Gerard Sweeney
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

Most of my questions have been answered, but I just had one quick question on Precoat. You implied that you think the segment has bottomed, but we also talked about some prepayment imports that are being at surplus. Are you able to bracket out how much that surplus was a headwind for the segment, and what we should be thinking about that on a go-forward basis?

Thomas Ferguson
President, CEO & Director

Yes, certainly. The thought process around about the prepainted metal imports is really correlating the data that we can see internally. So we can see internally the [ beer ] imports coming in and get a feeling for that and then translate it back into what prepainted import material is out there in the pipeline. So we've seen that filter through our system and filter through our customer systems to the point where less prepainted metal imports historically, up to this point in time, have not necessarily had any impact on our business. And our anticipation going forward is we start to see some of that benefit filter through.

If you think about that prepainted metal import market, it's around about 10% of the U.S. market is fulfilled through that supply chain. It's down around about 35% this year, but it's gaining momentum in terms of how much it's down, obviously, it's down more as you get to the third quarter versus the first quarter.

So it creates that market opportunity. And really, if you look at that prepainted metal import market, and who can serve that market, then there's only a couple of players that can really serve that market. And obviously, AZZ Precoat is one of the names at the top of that list. So it creates a nice opportunity for us as we start to look at our opportunities for next year.

This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Ferguson, CEO, for any closing remarks.

Thomas Ferguson
