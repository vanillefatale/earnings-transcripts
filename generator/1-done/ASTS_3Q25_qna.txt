Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[ Kevin ] from Vancouver asks, what is the difference in processing capacity between Block 2 FPGA satellites and Block 2 ASICs?

Abel Avellan
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Kevin, that's a great question. Listen, we have been improving, on a ten-fold steps, our processing capacity for the satellites. We started with 100 megahertz on BlueWalker 3, which, by the way, is still working and functioning, then to upgrade it to 1 gigahertz, which is the current -- so a tenfold increase with the current satellite or current orbit in operations. And then the one that we're starting to launch immediately here have another increased factor of 10 gigahertz -- going up to 10 gigahertz for 9 gigahertz so another 10x factors.

When you combine the processing capacity that we have on the satellites with the AI engine that we're developing to basically managing very efficiently the spectrum allocation of both power and bandwidth, this is a very -- this is the way that we do the -- through broadband connectivity from the space. And that -- for that, we developed our own chip. We call it the AST5000 that had a processing capacity to 10 gigahertz with enhanced features to take the most of the 10 gigahertz using our AI engines.

Operator

[ Alvin ] from Massachusetts asks, as a forward-looking investor, I would like to know if the company is weighing the benefits of AI for its spectrum management.

Abel Avellan
Founder, Chairman & CEO

We are more than weighing the benefit. We're working on it. We are implementing our AI engine for managing and administrating the spectrum. Each satellite had a capacity of 10 gigahertz processing bandwidth, but we feel that, effectively, we multiply that by several factors by effectively managing the allocation of spectrum and resources dynamically across the network using AI. And that's something that we've been working for a while. Thus, the system and the satellite have already been designed to have all the hooks and all the management capability, trading maximum benefit of AI on spectrum management.

When you think about that, in average, terrestrial operators have per market in countries like United States, maybe around 250 megahertz to deploy spectrum between our own spectrum and spectrum provided by the operators, we -- yes, in the United States alone, we have access to around 80 megahertz. We will have access to around 80 megahertz of spectrum, 50 to be our own. And then you add an AI -- our AI engine to basically multiply that spectrum and make them much more efficient. This is a very significant new leg of the telco stack. So we see a world where you have WiFi, terrestrial, and now with the amount of capacity and spectrum that we can manage with our satellites and our AI engine to basically effectively use that spectrum. We believe that the usage of satellite become more and more and more relevant as we add satellites and then we add spectrum to the system.

Operator

[ Kevin ] from Oregon asks, with the next series of launches starting possibly next month at Cape Canaveral, I have been wondering if or how AST SpaceMobile will structure a future launch event for retail shareholders.

Scott Wisniewski
President & Chief Strategy Officer

Thanks, Kevin, for the question. As you can tell from the topics on this call, we're very, very much in a commercial mindset at this point and moving towards service delivery. But nonetheless, the launch campaign is very exciting, and we're very excited as well. We just shipped BlueBird 6. We're getting ready to ship BlueBird 7 and the rest of the BlueBirds are starting to come out of the factory. So we're very excited about the launch campaign. It's going to be a fantastic stretch of launches. And just like with our last launch where we had about 1,000 retail investors, we plan to invite as many as we can to the launch, and it's -- in each of the launches. So it's going to be a great campaign. We're super thrilled and 5 launches before the end of Q1 2026 and our 45 to 60 satellites during 2026. There's going to be a lot of opportunities for retail to come see, and we hope everybody comes along to participate on this journey with us.

Operator

[ Rupert ] from Zurich asks, despite confirmed and fully funded for a full constellation through balance sheet cash and future revenue, why was additional capital raised.

Andrew Johnson
Executive VP, CFO, Chief Legal Officer & Director

I'll take that. This is Andy. Rupert, thank you for the question. It's clear that 2025 has been a fantastic opportunity for AST to access the capital markets. It's been a great climate for that. And as you point out, we recently completed our third convertible note deal of the year, the first in January, the second in July and the third one just recently last month. This was an incredible transaction for us and strengthening the balance sheet. As a reminder, we were able to raise net proceeds of a little over $1 billion at a 2% coupon with a 10-year term, a convertible note deal that hasn't been done in many, many years. So we're very happy with that result. The opportunity was there.

And importantly, you point out, Rupert, that it is true, and we talked about it at the last earnings call, that we were previously fully funded for a constellation of 45 to 60 satellites. What this additional financing does is it provides us the ability to move faster with more flexibility on the balance sheet to go beyond those initial markets of the U.S., Europe, Japan and others that we talked about at 45 to 60 and to look worldwide in our coverage at a constellation of now being fully funded at 100-plus satellites.

So consistent with our stc announcement, we are looking and working hard on commercial opportunities in other strategic markets across the world, and our balance sheet is now fortified to provide a runway to manufacture and launch satellites to support that worldwide constellation base. Thank you.

Scott Wisniewski
President & Chief Strategy Officer

And with that, I'd like to thank our shareholders for submitting those questions. Operator, let's open the call to analyst questions now.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Funk with Bank of America.

Michael Funk
BofA Securities, Research Division

Congratulations on the funding activity during the quarter and the fully funded status. So I wanted to tie that back to the comments on the prepayments and the $1 billion contract to date. So what is your appetite or thoughts on future prepayment deals with customers, the commercial financial benefits to signing these now that you are fully funded. And then maybe part B to the question, if I could, any more broad detail around those prepayment contracts, whether they are for capacity subscribers. Any details on the broad terms would be helpful.

Scott Wisniewski
President & Chief Strategy Officer

Michael, it's Scott here. So -- can you hear me okay?

Michael Funk
BofA Securities, Research Division

I can.

Scott Wisniewski
President & Chief Strategy Officer

Great. So our strategy for about 2 years now has been to pursue our very long funnel of agreements, right? We have 50-plus agreements with operators globally and we have nearly 3 billion subscribers. So the strategy has been started with our best partners who are most aligned, build out those relationships, build out those agreements and bring in prepayments and long-term capital -- long-term revenue commitments.

And so that strategy is unchanged. I think clearly, we have demonstrated access to the capital markets, but signing up these agreements with prepayments and commitments is still very much our strategy, and we'll balance all those factors appropriately. The way to think about them is relatively simple. Prepayments are for commercial services in the near term and the commitments can be near term, medium term, long term. And we balance each of those on each relationship and each situation as appropriate. But the strategy is really unchanged. We think it's playing out well, and we're going to continue it.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Mike Crawford with B. Riley Securities.

Michael Crawford
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

When you start manufacturing L-band satellites, do you intend to put L-band and S-band on the same satellites? And also will you await formal FCC approval before starting to make those?

Abel Avellan
Founder, Chairman & CEO

We plan to have a -- well, first of all, when we launch these satellites, they have all the 3GPP frequencies, either in the low band or the mid-band, including all the MSS Band, the L and the S that we had acquired. Our plan is to interleave them between the low band and the mid-band. Now we're fully funded for doing that. And our plan is to start launching mid-band satellites by the end of next year. We want that to be in line with the road map that we have for -- in the U.S., Europe and Japan and now Saudi Arabia. And as we said, we're going to use this capital to basically deploy more globally in both operator spectrum and our own spectrum and be able to combine in the network, both in order to facilitate 120 megabit per second basically everywhere that we deploy both our bands and the operator bands.

Michael Crawford
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And just a follow-up to that is your Saudi Telecom agreement, you anticipate to launch commercial services in the fourth quarter '26. So -- but I don't think you specified over what spectrum. And then the other part to that is if there were -- if I heard that there's additional service revenue commitments on top of the $175 million prepaid.

Abel Avellan
Founder, Chairman & CEO

I will have Scott to explain the -- how the agreement with stc works. But we are always starting with operator spectrum available in every device. So we focus on using spectrum that is 3GPP that is already on devices and how we're starting with stc and all our partners here in the U.S., in Europe, in Japan, will be no different in the Middle East region, led by Saudi Arabia.

Scott Wisniewski
President & Chief Strategy Officer

And on the commitment, so we put forward this new disclosure, Mike, this quarter of over $1 billion of commitments. And those are not soft commitments. Those are designed to be very valuable to us and very indicative of future expectations and very valuable, both in the debt context and also as guidance to the equity market.

So when we say we have over $1 billion of revenue commitments, those are very hard commitments. And so we purposely put that out and we're not going to identify that with individual customers or individual contracts. But I would point you to the stc press release. We did mention that there was a prepayment and then also a long-term revenue commitment. So we're not going to map that to individual contracts going forward, but it is our strategy, and we'll provide updates from time to time as appropriate. But very importantly, we're now over $1 billion in total, which is a good outcome for us in line with our strategy, and we think consistent with the customer excitement about us and the customer excitement about putting this product into their customer hands.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank.

Bryan Kraft
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I had a few if I could. First, I know that you reiterated your launch timing guidance in terms of the number of launches you're targeting by the end of 1Q and the end of next year. It seems like the launch time line now has become a bit more compressed with some delays at the front end of the summer and into the fall. Just with that in mind, I wanted to ask you about your confidence in achieving the 5 launches by the end of 1Q and the 60 satellites by the end of next year. Is there any more risk now in that time line from your perspective?

And then separately, I wanted to ask you about the EU satellite constellation announcement. Are these satellites incremental to the plan? Or are they part of the existing 60 satellites by the end of next year. And if they are incremental, can you talk about the timing for launching them and what the CapEx and funding implications are?

And then lastly, related to that, there's been some talk in the market about AST winning part of the IRIS2 mandate in Europe. Is that something that is happening? Is that real? Or is that just noise in the market?

Abel Avellan
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Okay. Bryan, I would try to dissect the question in 3 parts. Let me start with the launch, and I want to start with where are we with manufacturing. So by early 2026, Q1, first part of Q2, we will have 40 satellites built. So we are at 19, satellites, 19 at the moment, and we are at a pace of 6 satellites a month starting in December. And that match very well with the launches that we had already financially committed and we are in the manifest of our partners -- our launch partners to take them starting the 1 in India, mid-December and then following the launches from the Cape to add up to the 5 launches by the end of Q1.

So we feel very confident on our launch campaign. This is been the culmination of our road map where we now have the ability to start launching by Q1, also our 10 gigahertz satellites that we plan to take the maximum out of them in the way that we manage that 10 gigahertz processing bandwidth per satellite. So we feel very comfortable there.

As it relates to your question in Europe, I mean, we are an American company that operates globally. And as such, we we're that market by market. Our go to market is exclusively through the partners and telcos that we operate with, I mean, including European markets. As you see the reception of what we're doing in Europe, jointly with Vodafone have been incredible. Twenty one of the 25 top operators in Europe have basically committed or expected to be part of the network and the constellation that we are building as part of our constellation, but with certain features for European MNOs.

And then that's really -- that add up to the 50-plus agreement that we had globally, reaching us over 3 billion subscribers that we can reach through the agreement that we have globally.

Bryan Kraft
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

So Abel, just to clarify then, so you're saying that the satellites for this constellation are part of the existing plan. They're not incremental. Is that correct?

Abel Avellan
Founder, Chairman & CEO

That's correct.

Bryan Kraft
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And then can you comment at all on the -- just the talk about IRIS Squared and whether AST might be part of that. It seems like you could be well positioned for it given this announcement today or over the weekend.

Scott Wisniewski
President & Chief Strategy Officer

Yes, we don't want to comment on new contract awards or anything like that. But given that we are already building a constellation with multiple capabilities, we think we're very well positioned for any country or any customer that's looking to get this capability, right? The incremental ability for us and the marginal economics for us to build out additional capabilities in orbit is very high, given our tech, given our manufacturing, given our existing ecosystem we've created. So I think we're very well positioned for opportunities like that. But Bryan, we don't -- we're not going to comment on any new contracts right now.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Colin Canfield with Cantor Fitzgerald.

Colin Canfield
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

I appreciate the sensitivity in terms of kind of IRIS commentary, but maybe just talking about kind of your supply chain versus the European supply chain. I think when investors kind of saw the 2030 targets around IRIS and some of the recent headlines in terms of kind of antitrust and mergers between kind of the, let's say, the existing supply chain folks for that domain, it's pretty obvious that's sort of like back and forth is going to limit their capabilities. So maybe without mentioning IRIS, if you could maybe talk about kind of how you think about your aperture for additional bands and leveraging the economies of scale that you have to do more than just S, L and C-Band.

Abel Avellan
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean -- well, first of all, our platform, it is designed to basically capture over 1,000 megahertz of spectrum that can be tuned across all 3GPP bands in the low band and the mid-band. So we basically design our network where we can take any band in any country as long as 3GPP, as long it's in devices, we can tune into it. So -- and our incremental cost for that is practically 0 because that is all software defined.

In term of, we will manufacture on how -- who we are. We are an American company. We manufacture in the United States. We are based in Midland, Texas, and -- but we operate globally. So -- and we're in the business of partnering with the MNOs, which are local, are in the local jurisdictions. We partner with them. They provide the spectrum. Sometimes we bring our own spectrum and complement that in order to deliver the best experience possible in the future for the end user device that basically, no matter what phones they're using and they get 120 megabit per second from space.

So that's really who we are. That's our strategy. We're Americans. We're based here. We announced we had over 1,800 people working on our system. But yes, we -- obviously, we're going to look very aggressively all around the globe. To add spectrum that is in local jurisdictions that is managed by local regulators and partner with local MNOs to offer the best of our services to each of the customers.

So -- but I wanted to make it clear, we're -- our focus is -- we're an American company that operates in America.

Colin Canfield
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

Got it. Got it. And as we think about kind of the sizing of the war chest that AST has put together, that tracks kind of roughly in terms of cash on hand to some of the legacy satellite communications debt levels, how do you think about kind of going out, acquiring either future spectrum or even something that might kind of get you closer to free cash flow positive sooner? And how do you think about kind of that potential takeout versus investing organically and essentially kind of taking business away to your own investment in IP?

Abel Avellan
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean, at the core of our strategy is partnering with the MNOs. The MNOs in the United States, we had access to around 80 megahertz of spectrum, call it 50 of our own and another 30 in combination of low band and mid-band spectrum available for us. So that, we believe, is a significant amount, especially when you start applying AI techniques to maximize it and make it more efficient. If you take into consideration roughly by market and roughly each market in the United States have around 250 megahertz of terrestrial deployed spectrum and we have access to around 80 for satellite, you can see that that's a very significant portion.

So we feel that we are very equipped to globally compete. So that's why we acquired the 50 megahertz in the United States. We have a priority right for another 60 in the United States. We're partnering with the global MNO ecosystem in Europe for Europe. So our focus is launching -- building satellites, which we are now at a rate that we feel proud and meet our business needs, which is around 6 per month of the largest satellites ever launched into LEO. We're doing that. We're breaking a world record every time that we take a satellite out of the factory, is the largest ever launched. So that's our primary focus, manufacturing. Second to that is launching them. And third to them is bring this service globally with a combination of local spectrum from the MNO and our own to basically offer the broadband experience as close as possible to terrestrial by using space.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schoell with UBS.

Christopher Schoell
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I just want to follow up on the funding progress. I recognize that you are saying you're fully funded, I believe, for 90 satellites in your queue. But will you continue to be opportunistic? And how should we think about additional capital raises as we go into 2026?

And then thank you for the color on the 4Q OpEx and CapEx. Just given the ramp in Block 2 production into '26, should we view 4Q as a good run rate when modeling out next year? Or will the timing of the launch payments cause spending to fluctuate?

Scott Wisniewski
President & Chief Strategy Officer

Chris, I'll take the first part and then Andy can take the second part. So in terms of fund flows, I guess, is the best way to think about it, I would look to the model on the commercial side and the comments we've made earlier in the call, where we're laser-focused on bringing in commercial prepayments, commercial commitments and ultimately, commercial revenue as soon as possible. We've reiterated our expectations on revenue in Q4. And going into 2026, we certainly expect continued growth. So we are very, very focused on the commercial side, which is why you saw the big announcements in the last month or so and the new disclosure on commitments for this call. And so that's definitely our focus.

We thought the moment was right to continue to build the cash balance and accelerate the time lines and run towards the growth opportunity, but in terms of our focus and our energy and where we're going to spend our time, it's 100% with customers. And the prepayments and commitment strategy is the right one. And on launch?

Andrew Johnson
Executive VP, CFO, Chief Legal Officer & Director

Yes. I would just add that, as Scott said, the focus is commercial. I mean we're always going to be opportunistic and open-minded about good capital markets, of course. But given where we are now, we have the flexibility to perhaps pull launch forward as opportunity allows. And we'll be prudent about that, continue to kind of weigh opportunities on the equity side. We also look at attractive things on the debt side. We believe that market will open up a little bit as we progress. So it's -- our priority is the commercial aspects of the business now, and we'll continue to give good thought. But I spend my time thinking about how to prudently deploy that capital that we've now raised on the balance sheet.

Christopher Schoell
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Great. And I can just follow up on the 4Q OpEx and CapEx, is that a good run rate when we start thinking about next year? Or can that be a little volatile?

Andrew Johnson
Executive VP, CFO, Chief Legal Officer & Director

Will be a little volatile. I think on OpEx, it's pretty darn close because we've been growing so dynamically as the years progressed. And we're at a stage now, as Abel and I've said it, close to 1,800 employees and workforce. And that OpEx feels pretty good and consistent.

On the CapEx side, it's going to ebb and flow. We've been roughly in that close range the last couple quarters. But as we get closer to launch and clearly '26 is closer to consistent cadence over every 30, 45 days, we'll have some spikes and some lulls and when launch payments are due. I think what our plan is on that, though, is we've told you how we feel in Q4, and we're halfway through that quarter. So we have good visibility, and then we'll come out after the year and give you an outlook on '26 holistically, both on OpEx and CapEx when we talk again toward the end of February, early March.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Louie DiPalma with William Blair.

Louie Dipalma
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Well, Scott and Andy, congrats on the Verizon and stc definitive contracts.

Scott Wisniewski
President & Chief Strategy Officer

Thanks a lot. Really appreciate it.

Louie Dipalma
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Do you think that the number that Andy cited having 25 satellites in orbit is a good estimate for the number to support beta trials in North America in 2026?

Scott Wisniewski
President & Chief Strategy Officer

Yes. No, that's right, Louie. Each operator thinks about these things a little bit differently. But yes, we think that that's a fair proxy, plus or minus.

Louie Dipalma
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Great. And also thanks for the color on the $1 billion in contracted revenue commitments. Is that for the 3 definitive commercial agreements? And are you able to disclose the average duration of the revenue commitments? I think the stc deal was for 10 years. Is it appropriate to assume that the others were of similar duration?

Scott Wisniewski
President & Chief Strategy Officer

So we're not going to give up an average duration, but I would say, it does vary. When you look at the contracts we've signed, they've been as long as 5, 6, 10 years, right? So each of the contracts is a little different. And the revenue commitment number that we disclosed, it is primarily with the definitive agreements, but there is some others in other binding agreements as well. So that's how to think about it.

It's going to vary, but it's a decent mix of short term, medium term and long term and structured well for the company.

Louie Dipalma
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

And in the past, you've discussed how your satellite processing tech can like recombine the disparate spectrum holdings from AT&T and Verizon to create a cohesive near nationwide footprint for approximately 5 megahertz. How is that technology working in trials?

Abel Avellan
Founder, Chairman & CEO

No, it is working very well. We are planning to be ready for nationwide service early in the year on an intermittent basis. The level of intermittency will reduce drastically, as we keep adding satellites. But you are correct. Our satellites have enough flexibility that we were able to take a spectrum from AT&T, spectrum from Verizon, combine it up and make a nationwide service or near nationwide service. That is -- that will be combined with our 50 megahertz. And our technology has the ability to pick and choose terrestrial spectrum, combining with satellite spectrum and offer that as a package to the end user.

Louie Dipalma
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Excellent. So your technology can combine the mobile satellite spectrum in addition to the AT&T and Verizon spectrum?

Scott Wisniewski
President & Chief Strategy Officer

Correct.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Greg Pendy with Clear Street.

Greg Pendy

Just a real quick one. Given the MNO momentum that you've seen with stc and Verizon, I guess your 50 MNOs represent roughly 3 billion subs. If I'm not mistaken, the market or the TAM is probably $5.6 billion. Just can you talk about, given your partnership model, about how many large MNO opportunities are left out there in the market.

Scott Wisniewski
President & Chief Strategy Officer

Sure. So we -- the interesting thing about how we've approached the market and how we built the company is that we're very favorable to MNOs. We've structured our technology, our network, our go-to-market strategy, even our cap stack, right, even the investors, it's very favorable intentionally towards our customer, the operator.

So as we've built the ecosystem over the last 5 to 10 years, it's really been around who's most aligned, who can -- who's most forward thinking. And as we get closer to service, there's less forward thinking, and it's more that everybody feels that they need this capability.

So we have this fascinating dynamic where we're not really constrained by historical relationships or operators that want to work with us. We find pretty much nearly all the operators in the world, if not all, want to work with us and want to learn more and want to participate. So we're going to continue to harvest that base for good contracts for the company for the initial markets that we deploy and then grow that base into the medium tail and the long tail as we grow.

So I think in terms of big, big MNO opportunities, it's -- we've chosen not to do business in China or Russia but -- and other smaller restricted countries. But other than that, most operators are good candidates and have some level of dialogue with us, and we're going to continue to pursue those opportunities.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Quilty with Quilty Space.

Christopher Quilty
Quilty Space Inc., Research Division

Maybe a more nuanced question than Louie about the $1 billion commitments. Is that all commercial? Or is that a combination of commercial and government?

Scott Wisniewski
President & Chief Strategy Officer

That's all commercial.

Christopher Quilty
Quilty Space Inc., Research Division

Great. And maybe to follow on, I mean you're capitalized now for 100 satellites. Again, I'm assuming that's all for the commercial side, obviously, Secretary of Department of War, Hegseth speech, Friday indicating that contractors are going to have to commit their own capital to getting things done. Or is it fair to assume that most of the programs you're working on will be more in the sort of Star -- SpaceX Starshield model of vendor built and operated government-owned?

Abel Avellan
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean, we have been a big proponent for a long time for the government for the dual-use COMSAT. Basically, we believe that to maintain competitiveness for United States, the ability to combine commercial usage with government usage is paramount. And so we basically -- our funnel with the government, which is very substantial, it calls for that model. So we don't discard there will be occasions that there will manufacture certain assets tailor made to the government, but we're prioritizing the dual use in every opportunity that we have.

Christopher Quilty
Quilty Space Inc., Research Division

Great. And final question, just on the launch. When will you give us some visibility on specific launch vehicles as we approach the launch dates. Obviously, the heavy lift market is extremely constrained and I watched in the last week, both Blue Origin and ULA delay and delay. SpaceX is really the only operator out there that's launching on a regular cadence. It's a tight market at current time. And are you expecting other launch vehicles to become available?

Abel Avellan
Founder, Chairman & CEO

We're expecting other launch vehicles to become available, but our current existing and immediate launch campaign, it is using the regular suspects, SpaceX, New Glenn, [ Heathrow ] and there are new capacity coming up from other operations like NHI that are available to us. But the immediate launches are around American launches here in the U.S.

Christopher Quilty
Quilty Space Inc., Research Division

Got you. And are you still aiming for the same sort of 3 to 4 BlueBirds per Falcon 9, I think, 8 for New Glenn? And are there things that you're doing or can do in order to increase the number of satellites per launch vehicle either in mass or dispenser design or other tricks?

Abel Avellan
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Yes. No, that is correct. I mean we basically can go at the double of the speed in terms of number of satellites per launch with the New Glenn platform that we can with the SpaceX platform. But yes, it's at full capacities, 8 in New Glenn and around 3 in the Falcon 9.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Searle with ROTH Capital Partners.

Scott Searle
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

Maybe just a couple of quick follow-ups and clarifications. Now that you're funded up to 100 satellites and the initial phase of the constellation of 45 to 60 gets you to commercialization in the key developed markets, should we expect that you're just going to continue to roll through to build up to the 90 to 100-plus satellites in terms of, I'll call it, Phase 2 constellation as we go into 2027?

Or are there some other milestones to be thinking about in terms of customer contracts or otherwise that will be a precursor to that happening? And also as part of that, from a spectrum standpoint, you had a very astute buy of the Ligado spectrum in North America. I know you have access in international markets, but there are some other costs that come along with that. I wonder if you could just frame for us kind of how you're conceptually thinking about incremental spectrum costs going forward, particularly in international markets.

Abel Avellan
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean, the architecture basically designed to basically mix and match our own spectrum with operator spectrum and tune all across the low band and mid-band spectrum. So basically, our cost of incremental spectrum is marginal. It doesn't cause us more on the platform to activate additional spectrum. So that would make it very attractive. We can partner with the 700 in certain jurisdictions. And in another one, we are in the mid-band, in combination with their own spectrum. So we -- our incremental cost for additional spectrum is marginal to none as long as it's 3GPP spectrum and it's as long as it's in devices.

And our strategy is always starting broadband services with a spectrum that is available in devices.

Scott Searle
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

Great. And just a clarification in terms of your continued launch cadence, if you will, once we get to 60 satellites or are the milestones that you're thinking about or any sort of color you could add in terms of the continued expansion of the global constellation.

Scott Wisniewski
President & Chief Strategy Officer

Sure. So our strategy on satellite deployment hasn't really changed either, right? Our strategy has been, as we have capital access and as we see positive NPV growth, we're going to commit to it. And so that was the driver behind how we announced and have thought about the 45 to 60 satellite target that we put in place a year or so ago. And with further access to capital and, frankly, further traction faster and more attractively on the operator side and potentially the government side as well, we've recalibrated those expectations, and that's part of what's behind the capital we've raised.

So where do we go from here? How do we continue to build those out? We pride ourselves on being very nimble. Remember, we're vertically integrated. We can put incremental improvements into our constellation as we go, like with the ASIC to come in Q1. And so we're going to continue to move that way. We are not making multiyear planning decisions. We're pivoting and moving quickly. And as we see things move and we see opportunities, we're going to pivot quickly.

But for us, at this point, we see nothing but opportunity. We see nothing but growth. So we're racing towards more satellites fast. And so that's how we're thinking about it, Scott, is -- there's no real holdup on us for continuing to build, but we're going to evaluate growth opportunities on a rolling basis, and that's what you've seen us do the last couple of years.

And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I'll now turn the call back over to Scott Wisniewski for closing remarks.
