Our first question comes from the line of Laurent Vasilescu of BNP Paribas.

Laurent Vasilescu
BNP Paribas Exane, Research Division

I wanted to ask about your European momentum. We had a major U.S. brand caution about the European marketplace the other week again around increased promotionality. Curious to hear what you're seeing in this important marketplace? How do you -- how are your European prebooks look for next spring?

And then Harmit, just on the 4Q guide, the gross margin down 100 basis points. Can you maybe just unpack that a little bit more, what's the 53rd week impact on the GM? And what are the positive offsets?

Harmit Singh
Executive VP & Chief Financial & Growth Officer

Sure. Laurent, thanks for calling in. So Europe was up 3% for the quarter. You heard in my prepared remarks about the weather impact. But as soon as the weather cooled, we saw Europe accelerate to double-digit growth, especially as we exited the quarter.

There was some shifting in July and August, but September remains strong. We have seen growth in the quarter across both channels. DTC was up 4%, wholesale was up 2%. Some key markets really performed. U.K. was up high mid-teen and high single-digit growth in Germany and Italy.

If you think across Men and Women, Women continues to be strong in Europe. And the consumer is gravitating towards a broader assortment, looser fits, 501, tops, which is our fastest-growing category. So our view is, unlike the other major brands that you mentioned, we expect to end the year up mid-single digit. And this has accelerated substantially relative to a year ago. September is off to a good start. Our prebook for spring is up mid-single digits. Having said all that, our operating margins were also up 80 basis points. So I think that's our perspective of Europe. A big shout-out to the team on the ground that is working its way through it.

On your question, I can broadly talk Q4 guidance and then I'll talk gross margins in a minute. But on Q4, we expect the momentum of our business to continue, and our view is that fundamentally, the underlying trends remain strong. Our Q4 guidance overall is impacted by 3 things: the year we're lapping, which includes a 53rd week, which helped Q4 last year by 4 points in revenue and 20 basis points in gross margin.

We do have an incremental headwind on tariff. It's impacting gross margin first, unmitigated by 130 basis points and mitigated by about 50 basis -- sorry, by 8 about 0 basis points and EPS by $0.03. Had it not been for tariffs, our gross margins in quarter 4 would have been up. I mean, it's pretty factual.

And then we're just taking a conservative approach to the quarter given the complex macros, there's tariffs and maybe potential impact on demand. We are not seeing it as we closed out September and the continued transformation of our distribution center. The way to think about it, folks is our -- we're replacing our full year top line guidance to 6% organic. And if you think of the last 3 years, '23 organic growth was flat, '24 was about -- close to 3% and this year, 6%. So as I said in the prepared remarks, we're solidly on track to be a mid-single-digit growth company.

And EBIT margin should end the year in the mid 11% in 2026 or close to 9%. So we've steadily improved that higher gross margin efforts on SG&A and flow-through onto EBIT margin.

BNP Paribas Exane, Research Division

That's great to hear. Best of luck with the holiday season.

Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.

Matthew Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So Michelle, could you elaborate on the momentum that you cited entering the season? Maybe what are you seeing in the denim category or from the consumer broadly?

And then Harmit, so have you seen any material change in demand trends in September or October globally? Or is it just prudent planning for the remainder of the quarter that's driving the moderation that's embedded in your fourth quarter organic revenue guidance?

Harmit Singh
Executive VP & Chief Financial & Growth Officer

I'll answer your second first because I'm sure it's top of mind for folks. No, it's just being -- the prudent guidance is just being conservatism on the macros. We are not seeing any underlying change in trends, as I reflected. I think we're really well set for holidays, and Michelle can give you a perspective on the category and the consumer.

Michelle Gass
CEO, President & Director

Sure. So Matt, thanks for the question. First, let me talk about the category. We're really excited. I mean the denim category is accelerating both here in the U.S. and globally. And as the definitive market leader, we are very well positioned to take advantage of that.

And of course, as the leader, we help fuel the growth, and we're seeing that happen. Just to remind everyone, we are the market share leader across men's and women's globally, and we continue to maintain our #1 share position in the U.S. as well as for both men and women. I'd say most recently, we're really thrilled to see that we're gaining share in used, premium and with our signature business. So when we think about our business from a segmentation standpoint, doing really well with Red Tab.

And for those consumers who are more value-oriented, we saw our signature business up double digits this quarter. What's driving that for our business in terms of market share gains and again, as the leader, helping to fuel the momentum in the category overall, I mean it starts with product.

We're bringing a lot of newness and innovation into our business through fits, fabrics, silhouettes, a lot of that's still happening with baggy, but we're really seeing strength across the board. And importantly, not only is it continuing to be the leader in denim bottoms, but we're really expanding our addressable market as we think about going from denim bottoms to head-to-toe denim lifestyle, and we're seeing that momentum in categories like tops.

So when you take a step back, I mean, historically, we've been around many decades. We really built this business on denim, but we're building our future on denim lifestyle. So we feel good about the category, our position.

Now more broadly, to your question on the consumer, I think kind of building on Harmit's comments and mine, our consumer continues to be resilient, and we're seeing that around the globe. I mean it starts with the business, our fourth consecutive quarter of high single-digit organic growth globally. And I think it's important to make note that this -- for the quarter, this business was driven largely through unit growth, right?

So it's unit growth that's really fueling that momentum. And we saw broad-based strength across geographies, across categories at both men's and women's, tops and bottoms and both DTC and wholesale. So consumers responding. Our strategies are working. I mentioned the denim category accelerating, I mentioned really kind of being relevant across these various consumer cohorts and we guess that we're operating in a complex environment here in the U.S. We're staying close to it.

But when you think about the Levi's brand, in times of uncertainty, consumers turns to brands that they know and trust and Levi's is certainly one of those brands. So we're optimistic as we enter the fourth quarter. We expect the health and the momentum of our business to continue. We've been planning for holiday all year, and I would say we have our most robust lifestyle assortment we've ever brought to the consumer. We've lost a seasonally relevant product across really all categories.

And again, we continue to make progress on the head-to-toe, so you'll see lots of the fashion bottoms as well as tops and outerwear, third pieces. And I think products that really go sort of from day to night at work to evening events, especially during the holiday season, but there's a lot of newness and that will also be fueled by tremendous marketing.

We've had a great year of marketing with Beyonce, we've got Shaboozey right now, and you can expect us to continue to connect in a relevant way during the holiday season.

Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo.

Irwin Boruchow
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Let me add my congratulations. Maybe Harmit, just to focus on margins specifically. Can you comment on 2 things: one, within the SG&A cost line, you talked a little bit about it earlier, but the distribution line is running around 7% of sales right now. I know can you remind us the moving pieces on the warehousing and DCs you have going on? A year ago, it was around. I think historically, it's been 5%.

How quickly does that margin start to benefit you guys as you go into next year? And then to that point, are you comfortable beginning to lay out a time line on the return to 15% margin you guys kind of put back on the table several quarters ago as the momentum picked up?

Harmit Singh
Executive VP & Chief Financial & Growth Officer

So let me -- Ike, I'll start with gross margin, I'll give you some color about what happened in Q3, so people and yourself understand. Then I'll go quickly into SG&A and distribution.

So think of gross margin in quarter 3, up 110 basis points higher than what we had expected when we talked about this a quarter ago, 3 basic factors. One is the structural mix, which is higher women's, DTC and international that we think continues for a long, long time.

The second is we have taken moderate pricing, and we're driving higher full-price sales. And the third is the FX benefit, which we had called out about 50 basis points. This more than offset about 80 basis points of headwind from the tariffs. And so that's why, a, we were ahead of last year. And over delivery was FX and difficult to predict. We haven't predicted FX for quarter 4 as an example, and full price is something we're focused on. It's difficult to forecast that. So those are -- that gross margin.

Then you think about SG&A. Our SG&A for the quarter was below 50%. If you think the first half of the year, it was higher than 50% of revenue, higher than -- so the run rate was lower than the first half of the year, which was higher. The way we think of SG&A, I mean, there are 2 ways to look at it: a, gross profit dollars growing at a faster pace than SG&A dollars. So if you thin of year-to-date, our gross profit dollars are up $220 million and SG&A is up $126 million, so clearly driving high flow-through.

If you look at it just as a revenue to SG&A, SG&A up 6% and revenue up 8%, so clear leverage. As we think we end the year, if 6% is the revenue guidance organically, SG&A is probably in the mid-single digits, so there's clear leverage on that.

And this quarter, our SG&A being up relative to a year ago. There's performance comp, which is a big piece. We're having a good year. Distribution costs, which I'll come to in a minute, so I'll answer your question. We opened on a gross basis, 40 new stores. I mean -- and that's really the trifecta factor in DTC that is driving the results. Market expenses -- marketing expenses moved a little between Q4 and Q3, especially as we launched the Shaboozey campaign and some foreign exchange headwinds.

To your question, Ike, about distribution. Overall, as you know, we're remapping our distribution network to more of a hybrid network built for omnichannel from a manual network that is built for wholesale. So there are clear benefits that we will see over time. In the short term and transformations obviously have a short-term impact. Over the short term, in the U.S., we've been running panel DCs as we ramp up the new DC that's run by a third party.

So if you think of distribution costs, about 7%, and they've increased from a year ago. I would say about half of that is a reclass in distribution expenses from selling to distribution for e-commerce. And the other half is equally split between volume, which is driving more distribution expenses and the cost of parallel running. Our expectation is that parallel running of DCs -- because the good news is our demand is pretty robust. So as we make this transformation, we have to do in a way that we not only fulfill the demand for our customers and the consumers, but also ramp up and close this DC.

So our view is -- and it's our art and science, so we're working through that. But I think by the end of quarter 1, '26 is when we probably ramp down the parallel running of the DC, so early '26. And when we report results for quarter 4 in early 2026, we'll give you a perspective on distributed expenses. But over time, long term, we should reduce cost per unit and the cost of running parallel DCs. Does that help, Ike, answer your question?

Irwin Boruchow
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Yes. And I'm just curious, time line on the 15%, if there's anything you can share?

Harmit Singh
Executive VP & Chief Financial & Growth Officer

Yes. I think you're asking for a quick preview to Investor Day or a preview on that. But I think the way to think about that, Ike, is our EBIT margin should end the year about in the mid-11s, right? And they've grown nicely over the last couple of years. I think the basic building blocks are the following: the gross margin expansion continues. I mean, our view is that the structural piece continues. And if you take probably a 5-year period, you can say that's 200 basis points that should help EBIT.

The SG&A leverage, as we get to mid-single-digit growth company, I think the SG&A leverage is about 200 basis points. And we may ramp up advertising a little bit given the wonderful programs, our Chief Marketing Officer, and the teams are invoking. I think that helps drive the band, make the brand stronger and importantly, drive revenue. I think that's probably a 50-odd basis points of headwind, and that will come with revenue. So I think that's your building block. So you think of gross margin expansion, SG&A leverage and a little bit of reinvestment in advertising gets you to the 15%.

Our next question comes from the line of Paul Kearney of Barclays.

Paul Kearney
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Within the wholesale business growth, can you speak to how much was driven by maybe new points of distribution or expanded assortment versus like-for-like on stronger sell-throughs? And how would you categorize inventory levels within the retail channels heading into holidays?

Michelle Gass
CEO, President & Director

Sure, Paul. Thanks for the question. So as we said in our earlier remarks, we're quite pleased with the continued growth that we're seeing in the channel. This is now 4 consecutive quarters with this quarter up 5%. We do expect the year to be slightly positive in the wholesale channel for the entire year, which was actually up from our prior expectation, which we had said previously flat to slightly up.

We saw positive growth in this channel across all segments. We saw particular strength in U.S. wholesale. We saw it in Asia, Latin America and in the signature business, which is more for that value consumer. The growth is largely being driven with existing accounts as their consumers are responding to our fashion fits; women's, women's especially is outperforming; and lifestyle. So while we -- yes, we are bringing in some new accounts like Western Wear, we've got new distribution in Cavender's, we're expanding in Boot Barn. The growth is largely coming from our execution with our existing partners.

Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen of TD Securities.

Oliver Chen
TD Cowen, Research Division

Regarding Americas, the low single-digit growth, is your expectation that, that continues in Q4? And on the wholesale side, it's been a little more challenging channel, but do you think it will remain sustainably positive? Or will that be potentially volatile?

Second, there's a lot of great initiatives and partnerships, but part of the thesis is also like amplify to simplify with inventory management and SKU rationalization. So how do we reconcile those 2 in terms of where you are in that journey?

Michelle Gass
CEO, President & Director

Sure. Thanks, Oliver, for the question. As it relates to the Americas or I can speak to the biggest part of the business, which is the U.S. We're really proud about how the team has been executing in that market. This is our fifth consecutive quarter of growth. And I think as you all know, it's our largest, most mature, most competitive market. And both channels, DTC was up 6%, wholesale up 2%, and we continue to see long-term growth opportunities in both those channels.

So as I think about the DTC business here in the U.S., we have the potential to even double our store count and further accelerate e-commerce on the back of the momentum we have. And on wholesale, which I was just talking about more broadly, global wholesale, but wholesale in the U.S. remains strong. And our key partners are responding and their consumers are responding to our expanded product pipeline across men's, especially women's, where we continue to be under-indexed, in particular in the wholesale channel and then that head-to-toe lifestyle.

As we look forward, I'll just say that we -- as we look to Q4 in the U.S. and in the Americas, we expect the business to remain healthy against executing the same strategies we've been talking about, leaning into DTC, driving units per transaction, driving conversion, driving greater full price sell-through. As I was mentioning earlier, though, a lot of our growth is coming off of units. So while we are seeing that enhanced AUR, we're also driving a lot of volume growth.

And -- but I will say as it relates to U.S. wholesale, while we expect continued positive growth in DTC for the fourth quarter, we do expect in U.S. wholesale to be down given that we're lapping a very strong quarter last year, and we had that 53rd week. So as we lap last quarter's fourth quarter strong results, the 53rd week and just frankly, to be continuing to be prudent as we think about this channel given the complex macro environment we're operating in, in the U.S.

So Oliver, does that fully answer? And then you had part 2 of the question, let me answer that, and then I'll come back and make sure I've fully answered. But then part 2, I'm glad you asked the question about SKU rationalization because we continue to make really good progress there. So while we talk about expanded assortment, lifestyle, we are also, at the same time, reducing SKUs. And we've decreased our SKUs by about 15% compared to last year, and this has been an ongoing journey over the last 18 months or so. So we're continuing to raise the bar there.

And what's really enabling us to do that is through a tighter, globally common or globally directed assortment. So just for perspective, if we think about the season we're in right now, the second half of 2025, 40% of our SKUs are globally common. That's up from a couple of years ago where it was under 10%. So that allows us to make sure, again, that we can get the breadth and the lifestyle where we're getting significantly higher productivity per SKU. And that metric just for fun is up 20% on a SKU productivity.

So it really speaks to how the team is leaning in with a much stronger merchant mentality and operating like a retailer. And that's helping us drive those tailwinds that we're seeing in the business overall and especially in DTC.

Oliver Chen
TD Cowen, Research Division

Yes. That's really helpful. This is quick. I think, Harmit, are there any gross margin comparisons we should be aware of as we anniversary them this year and think about next year?

Harmit Singh
Executive VP & Chief Financial & Growth Officer

So last year was 53rd week. This year, I think the only piece will be -- we probably see tariff impact in the second half of this year, next year in the first half. The way we think about gross margin, and I think you're asking for a high-level framework for '26. And it's a good question. Let me just talk about it because as we build our plans for next year, the tailwinds that we think probably help gross margin accretion.

One is we're looking at pricing opportunities, again, targeted, not only in the U.S. but globally, given that 60% of the business is global, is outside the U.S. The structural improvements of DTC, international, women's continues. We continue to focus on full price selling, and it's not anywhere close to 100%. So there's clearly opportunity there.

The other piece is as you think about product cost, Michelle talked about the simplification of SKUs. We're looking at a shorter go-to-market calendar and cotton commodity is at a better spot today than it was a year ago. We've broadly locked in product costing for the first half. We are in the process -- by the time we report and guide '26, we'll probably have locked in the second half. So stay tuned, and the headwind is largely tariffs.

And so you've seen some impact in the second half of this year. We have offset the first -- the quarter 3. We're working to try and do what we can for quarter 4, but I've guided you the appropriate numbers. And so those are the tailwinds and the headwinds as you think about gross margin.

Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group.

Dana Telsey
Telsey Advisory Group LLC

As you think about the lifestyle offering, Michelle, with tops and with bottoms and jackets, outfits, what did you see in the growth rates of the different categories? And given the marketing that you've been doing in the collaborations, how do you think of the AUR opportunities going forward?

Michelle Gass
CEO, President & Director

Great. Thanks, Dana, for the question. We're really pleased with the progress and the acceleration in our tops business overall. And I'd like to say, while we're pleased, we're not satisfied, and there's a ton of upside because tops represents just currently 22% of our business. But as we shared earlier, our tops grew 9% overall for the quarter, 10% year-to-date, and we're really seeing the strength across channels and genders.

So if you double-click underneath that, men's up 10%, and we're really seeing popularity in things like Western tops, button downs, polos, wovens. As we think about our top strategy and denim lifestyle, we do start closer to our core. So really injecting life into like the Western Shirt, which is being advertised in our campaign right now with Shaboozey. But wovens. So wovens, things like our authentic button downs, that business for men's up 20%.

Similarly, women's tops up 8%, seeing it across both channels. Denim tops, I'll start there, up 12%. Wovens, including things like blouses, fashion, button downs up 37%. And then the category we're really expanding in to expand her closet, dresses and jump suits up nearly 20%. I think importantly, as we drive all this newness and excitement in head-to-toe dressing, we're seeing both growth in newness and in our core, which is really important to continue to support both.

Kind of back to the opportunity though, if you think about our business today, again, while we're making progress, there's so much upside. Our ratio of bottoms to tops is 3:1. Now that's up significantly from years ago where it was 7:1 or 5:1. But our goal is to get to 1:1, and I'm very confident we will. And as we drive tops, it's a UPT driver, it can be a traffic driver, and it really kind of completes this mission we're on to have Levi's stand for head-to-toe denim lifestyle. So hopefully, that addresses your question, Dana?

Our next question comes from the line of Aditya Kulkarni of UBS.

Jay Sole
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I think this is Jay Sole. Hopefully, you can hear me. But my question is that it sounds like you took some pricing in Q3. Harmit, I think you said one of the gross margin drivers in Q3 was pricing. Was that in response to tariff? And in Q4 -- sorry, before that, the consumer, it sounds like responded well to those price increases. Did you see any resistance? And then Q4, do you plan on accelerating the price increases? And therefore, do you expect the consumer to react differently if you increase prices in fourth quarter?

Harmit Singh
Executive VP & Chief Financial & Growth Officer

So Jay, we did. We took a little bit of pricing in Q3. It was not an MSRP because the goods are already been ticketed. This was in the sell-in to our customers, in the U.S. I'm talking about. And we do it thoughtfully. We have really great momentum, as we mentioned, driven by demand. But to answer your question, no impact on demand. We're not seeing any impact on demand either from the customer or the consumer.

The other piece that's really working for us is our new products. Because -- and so as we think longer term, pricing through innovation is one lever. We are also taking a hard look at our promotion and minimizing this as we focus on higher full price selling, will also be something that probably continues into '26. The way we're thinking about pricing, it's more important to think about what's the price value equation for our products relative to the marketplace, and that's an important consideration set.

The other piece that's important, Jay, is the segmentation of our products. So if you think of the value consumer in the U.S., we offer signature product. It's a great price point, it's offered through Walmart, and it had a great quarter. It was up double digits. We've just also introduced Blue Tab, which is our premium product. It's premium positioned. It's 1.5x to 2x the price of Red Tab product and offers real value even when you benchmark that. It's a limited offer. We hope to scale it is doing really well.

So that's how one is thinking through it. And there's a little bit of pricing in other parts of the world, but it's not something that we've done globally. So when we talk about '26 and guide '26, we'll give you a perspective on the pricing actions we have taken or our teams have taken around the world.

Our next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez of Citi.

Tracy Kogan
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

This is Tracy Kogan, filling in for Paul. I just had a follow-up on the last question. I think you said from what I understood that you only raised prices on sell-ins to your partners. So have you actually had time to see the consumer response to these higher prices? Or were you only saying that your partners haven't had any hesitancy to buy at these higher prices? And then just more broadly, I was hoping you could comment on the U.S. wholesale business, how sell-ins are comparing to sell-outs?

Harmit Singh
Executive VP & Chief Financial & Growth Officer

Generally -- Tracy, good question. I think it's a combination of both because the pricing initiatives have been now there through the quarter. A, the customers are not -- we're not seeing any demand contraction given the marginal pricing that has been taken or a consumer reaction. The consumer is generally resilient so far, and that's how we're approaching the pricing, plus the full price selling has been there for a while. And given that the product is very relevant and hitting the mark, we're not seeing any consumer pullback. I think that was your first question. What was your second one, Tracy, again?

Tracy Kogan
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I was hoping you could just comment more broadly on how the sell-ins to your wholesale partners are comparing to the sell-outs. Are they being more cautious than maybe the end consumer might indicate or something like that?

Harmit Singh
Executive VP & Chief Financial & Growth Officer

No, the sell-throughs have been fairly consistent with the sell-ins. And that's why we are optimistic about ending the year strongly and then maintaining the momentum as we begin '26.
