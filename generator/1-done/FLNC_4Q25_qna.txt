Our first question coming from the line of George Gianarikas with Canaccord.

George Gianarikas
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

I'm just curious if you can share any thoughts on what you're seeing in the competitive environment? Any changes there in the U.S. and internationally?

Julian Jose Marquez
President, CEO & Director

Internationally, not real change. It's a very competitive market, and the Chinese players continue to drive the competition in a way. The U.S., the competitive market is changing with -- we see more and more customers that prefer to use U.S. or non-PFE manufacturers, even if they're not required to do it under the -- because the projects are safeguarded under the law or of that provision. So I would say that, but it's an evolving matter that we see coming. So that's kind of today where I see the market.

George Gianarikas
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

And maybe as a follow-up, Ahmed, I think I heard when you were talking about gross margin or margin guidance for '26 that you expect margins to improve over time. Were you referring to gross margins moving beyond the 11% to 13% range you guided for next year, say, in '27, '28?

Ahmed Pasha
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. George, yes, I think our goal is to continue to improve the chart that we have disclosed. I think our goal is to continue to show that chart going forward to show the trajectory and the difference we are making. Our guidance, as you recall, was 10% to 15% in the past. I mean, I think our -- we haven't changed that going forward. So our goal is to continue to improve that trend line.

Our next question coming from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.

Brian Lee
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Kudos on the quarter here. Just I appreciate all the color, Julian, on the data center sizing. It sounds like that opportunity is coming to fruition here pretty quickly given the time line you expressed. But can you maybe help us a little bit understand, first, the sizing of the market, I guess, if we take the 30 gigawatt hours of data center projects in the pipeline and leads, that's maybe if we estimate maybe $6 billion of the total $23 billion pipeline or in that neighborhood. Is that kind of the way to think about it? And what do you think the overall TAM is and what Fluence's market share could ultimately end up looking like?

Julian Jose Marquez
President, CEO & Director

Good question. Let's start with the TAM. Last quarter, we talked about a TAM of around $8 billion. So I think that it's clearly -- the reality is proving that the number is significantly higher. The market has still very, very different numbers. I said we have seen numbers of the 10 times the $8 billion or more than 10 times the $8 billion. It's still unclear. We have to, I think, a little bit more. But clearly, it's a market that is expanding.

Of the 30 gigas that we talked about, as of September 30, only 20% of it, one small portion were in our pipeline. The rest were contracts that we started to -- with customers since then. And then today, if you ask me today this morning, roughly half of the 30 gig are in pipeline, the other half we're working on it. And what we're looking is -- will they happen in the next 2 years, where do we see our product is suitable to do what they want.

And generally, I think we are fine. So what's a big change from telling you a quarter ago, this is an $8 billion market requiring this very, very complex capabilities to today. I think there's a big change in terms of what we can do for what our technology and Fluence in particular, can do for data centers. And I would say the way to think about it is that there are 3 needs. One is what we call interconnection flexibility, the ability to manage your -- the energy demand in a way that you can interconnect easier to the grid and you can manage and the distribution companies or the service provider can manage your demand to keep the -- so that is by itself, I would say, today, the biggest driver.

People who want to connect quickly to the grid and want to ensure that the data center meets the availability of the grid and can give the assurances to the grid operator that they will not disrupt the grid. And we can do that today. That's what work. This is -- there's no -- we have no need to improvements in our technology stack to be able to do it. So great.

The second one that is also in a rising need or rising need is backup power. Historically, we haven't played that game. But with our costs coming down as they are and our ability to -- our density improvements, we can now provide backup power and significantly reduce. I won't say eliminate, but significantly reduce the need for diesel generators. So that's the second need that we're seeing. We can accelerate interconnection to the grid, and we can reduce some of the cost of the diesel generators by providing backup power.

The third one is the one we have talked about in our last call, this power quality, this idea that we can -- we will have to manage the variability of energy demand by AI data centers. That -- if you ask me today, that hasn't been -- the first thing is that there are other technologies that can address that. That's the first one.

The second one is that it is a need that is not as big as we thought it was going to be. So it's probably around that $8 billion number. And it is something that data centers, when they look at what they're doing, their speed to power is a much more important element than this one because the other one they can manage in some other way.

We are committed to delivering the 3 products. The interconnection flexibility to accelerate interconnection, the backup power capabilities. And these two that we can do today, and we're very well positioned to do. Smartstack is the densest project in the world. It is a project that because of the [indiscernible], the way we are designed provides very good safety, better than, I would say, very, very good.

And then third, our cybersecurity, our total control on software, our ability to ensure that no one else can get it. So the power quality is something we're working on with our inverter manufacturers. We'll get it resolved quickly, but it's still a work in progress. But we thought that was going to be a gating item the backup power is going to be a gating item for us to serve this market. That's no longer the case.

I would say it's a cherry on the top. If you can deliver the last 2 and this one is great, but it's not a gating item. So great market, multiples of what we told you in terms of what we do, and we don't need to do a major technology. And my last point, we can -- we don't have a clear view today. This is just starting on how much we can capture. What I will say, we are very well positioned to do safety, density.

Some of our competitors are claiming density, which is 20% to 25% less than what we can do. So that tells you we can do very, very well, and we are -- we have -- we hired Jeff. Jeff comes with knowing how to serve this market. He's been one of the structure, go and get this done. And this is not only happening in the U.S. This is a global phenomenon. We have in our pipeline. It's mostly U.S. today, but we're starting to see pipeline coming both out of Australia and Europe. So sorry for the long answer, but that we're excited about this opportunity.

Brian Lee
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Yes. No, I can definitely sense that. I appreciate all the color. Maybe just one more question on that topic. From a P&L timing and impact perspective, can you give us a sense of the conversion time line for this data center pipeline? And is any of it embedded in your revenue guide for fiscal '26? And maybe just lastly, margins relative to core margins. Are these going to be higher margin just given the customer subset you're dealing with? Curious on the impact on margins as well.

Julian Jose Marquez
President, CEO & Director

I'll say that of the 30 gigas, half are '26 order intake, half of our '27, give or take, and most likely projects that will be -- will convert into order intake later in the year, not revenue for '26. We have to see how much revenue for '27 is unclear. In terms of margin, this is a new segment. I don't want to talk about it publicly. But what I will say is that we can provide a lot of value to our customers, a lot of value. We can deliver our product quickly, give them the confidence on our security, the best density. And we are -- and so we are very confident that we can create a lot of value to our customers. That's where we're concentrated.

Our next question is coming from the line of Dylan Nassano with Wolfe Research.

Dylan Nassano
Wolfe Research, LLC

Just want to go back to the Q4 kind of underperformance versus the guide. I know that in the previous quarter, manufacturing delays kind of came up, but it sounded like maybe those were resolved and you were operating on schedule again. So I just want to check what kind of changed between the last call and now? And like are these incremental kind of problems that popped up? And anything you can give us just to kind of boost confidence going into the quarter that these are kind of resolved at this point?

Julian Jose Marquez
President, CEO & Director

So we have -- thanks, Dylan, and clearly, we're disappointed with what happened. I mean, first thing, but I don't want to say sound apologetic in what I'm telling you. But -- so what do we have? We have our suppliers in the U.S., many, but I say the 3 main suppliers. Out of the 3 main suppliers, 2 are doing great. I would say even more, the 2 that have the more complex process are doing very well. So we're very happy, ahead of schedule, doing wonderful, no problem. We have a less complex process, which is enclosure manufacturing.

When we met last quarter, we had a plan that was going to be able -- going to allow the delivery of our revenue for the year, but that it required a major staffing process that I think we underestimated the ability to staff that facility. I think that today, that we have done 2 things. We have clearly gone out and continue staffing and preparing people, and we're essentially done in terms of staffing. There's still some people, but it is essentially done. And we have made some changes in the way we are with our contract manufacturer to ensure that we meet our -- that we need to facilitate the manufacturing process. That's the right word.

And I think the two combinations, having staffed the place, and we're talking about a significant number of people. This is roughly 500, 600 people that we needed for that facility to work with 3 shifts and all of that. We were fully -- essentially fully staffed. And with the changes in operations, we are meeting our numbers. I think we are -- we expect to do -- we were doing at the end of last quarter, 1.5 closures per day. We are already at 5, and we are ramping up, and I don't know that we will be able to meet our numbers very well.

So we are very confident today. Unfortunately, we did not meet what we could not deliver on the revenue, and we are disappointed, but we learned very quickly. Our operation and manufacturing team is very, very good and they have put in place their corrective measures to this.

Ahmed Pasha
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Dylan, the only thing I would add is I think that from our perspective, as Julian said, yes, because of the labor shortage, we were roughly 1.5 containers per day. Fast forward, we added 500 people. We are now running at 5 containers per day and which is in line with our expectations for the quarter. So we feel pretty good where we are. But equally importantly, I think we pulled our levers to deliver on our profitability commitments. As you saw, the margin and the EBITDA, we are in line with our top end of our range.

Dylan Nassano
Wolfe Research, LLC

Got it. I appreciate that. And then my follow-up, I just wanted to check on this new cell supplier. Can you just give us any more color around how much incremental capacity this may get you? Any -- are you prepaying for any sales like similar to what you did with AESC? And yes, so mostly just curious like does this get you net additional capacity to serve the U.S. market?

Ahmed Pasha
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, I can take that question. Dylan, yes, I think this gives us enough capacity to serve our projected loads for the next couple of years. So we feel pretty good what we have signed. And in terms of the deposits, no, no material deposit commitments. I think it's just as we get the deliveries, we make those payments.

Our next question coming from the line of Ameet Thakkar with BMO Capital Markets.

Ameet Thakkar
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

I just wanted to kind of go back to kind of the implied EBITDA margin for this year versus last year. I mean it looks like the EBITDA margin is down, and I know the gross margin is also kind of down sequentially. But it looks like the implied ASPs in your bookings are actually up pretty significantly kind of quarter-over-quarter. I was just wondering if you could kind of walk us through why, I guess, the gross margin is lower year-over-year versus kind of the rolling 12 months.

Ahmed Pasha
Senior VP & CFO

So I think the ASPs, your question is, yes, I think is down, but no surprise. I think ASPs are down roughly, I think, give or take, 10% or so. In terms of the gross margin, I think we basically are pretty much in line. I think the EBITDA margin as you ask, is obviously, there's an operating leverage because volume was less. Last year, our overall revenue was $2.7 billion. This is $2.3 billion.

So yes, I think -- but the more important thing, frankly, from our perspective is as we grow the top line, we will benefit from the operating leverage and our goal is to continue to grow EBITDA. Obviously, that is what the shareholders care. At the end of the day, top line is great, but at the end of the day, that should translate into the bottom line. And that's what we, as a management team also are on the same page. So stay tuned. I think our goal is to continue to improve the top line and also the bottom line.

Ameet Thakkar
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

And then I know you kind of talked about a couple of kind of uses of liquidity for next year. But just in terms of kind of like the kind of the free cash flow expectations relative to that $50 million kind of EBITDA guidance at the midpoint. Any kind of, I guess, guidepost there, please?

Ahmed Pasha
Senior VP & CFO

So yes, I think the $50 million EBITDA, I talked about the working capital, roughly $100 million as our revenue is growing by from $2.3 billion to $3.4 billion. So $1 billion or so of additional -- as if you recall, we said in the past, working capital needs are roughly 10% of our growth in revenue. So about $100 million of working capital needs and then $100 million of investments in the domestic content, as I mentioned in my remarks. Beyond that, we don't have any material commitments.

So I think next year, our goal is to be free cash flow positive as our revenue grows and our EBITDA grows. So I think that is the goal. But this year, $50 million is the EBITDA, but then we have working capital needs of $100 million. But I think more importantly or equally importantly is liquidity will remain very robust with this working capital use. So our goal is to continue to strengthen our balance sheet with growing cash and our credit facilities. So we feel pretty good where we're going to land at the end of the year.

Our next question coming from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Nicely done this quarter. Just following up on a little bit about some of the margin commentary and just filtering that back in with AESC. Can you comment a little bit on how you think about margins being tethered to whatever happens with respect to your domestic supply, whether that's with AESC or incremental supply. Does that -- is that part of the commentary about margin improvement? And then related, can you just give a little bit more of a detailed update around AESC specifically? I know that you've sort of "procured a backup here, if you will. But how is that relationship evolving here? How would you frame out volumes from one side or the other side of that supply arrangement now at this point?

Julian Jose Marquez
President, CEO & Director

In terms of margins, in terms of AESC, I mean, any deal we do, we might do with AESC will be accretive. So that's the way you need to think about it. We -- when and if it happens, we'll communicate what it means in terms of margins. And I think that Ameet's point was more general. When you looked at our performance -- at least since I got here, we got a company with negative margins of 4%. We're now on a running average of 12 month average, we're now at 13.7%.

So my point is we all here want to commit to continue showing a growing line. That's kind of what we're doing, and we're finding ways to do it today and continue to work on it. That was more of that coming in that direction. In terms of AESC, what I would say is that we are -- meeting the OB3, OBBA compliance is a complex process. We have been able to make a lot of progress. And generally, you can look at it from 3 areas. You need to meet the IP. And I think we have a solution that's done and we can -- the IP in that -- for that production facility meets the criteria of OBBBA3 -- OBBA or meet the criteria.

Then we have the material systems, the need that the suppliers of the facility cannot come from PFP suppliers. We have a plan that will deliver that. And then we have the ownership. And the ownership is the one where we are still debating. We are making good progress. We're committed to resolve it, but we haven't -- have not reached a final deal. What we have always said, we're not the only option in town. So there are other ways that they can resolve this issue. And I don't want to -- we clearly believe that we are the best option from my point of view, but they can do something different.

So -- and then on the new supplier, I mean, what it is, is we're generally diversified suppliers. That's a rule of life. So we're diversified suppliers. And the demand we see is very big. So we need to continue to meet the growing demand. So our philosophy of diversified suppliers and the growing demand call for the second supplier. So that's where we are. We are -- we see this as one of our competitive advantages. We are a first mover in this area, and we want to continue being the first mover. So that's the reason for our strategy.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

So just to clarify that real quickly, basically, your current plan and current margin expectations assume that you're served with AESC. And would it be improved or detrimental to shift the supply, if I heard you right or understand.

Julian Jose Marquez
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean I will say the following. The -- as I said, a potential deal with AESC will be accretive to the current numbers. That answer I can provide.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

All right. You're already here cutting it. Okay. Understood.

Julian Jose Marquez
President, CEO & Director

No, I'm not cutting that. Having done the deals yet.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. All right. Got it. No, that's why I asked. I appreciate it.

Our next question coming from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.

David Arcaro
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

In terms of the data center pipeline, I was curious just to get your -- what you're currently seeing. Is this bringing larger project sizes versus your current backlog? Is it more U.S. heavy in terms of region where you're seeing that demand? And would be curious what kind of duration you might be exploring for those types of projects?

Julian Jose Marquez
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I'll say that generally, we talked during the call with one of the big drivers of the elasticity of demand where you can see the elasticity of demand for our technology as prices has come down has been how projects are getting bigger. And we have today 38 projects that are 1 gigawatt hour or more. I don't think that the data centers are bigger, naturally bigger, they are in line with what we have when you look at it, some are smaller, some are bigger, but generally in line.

In terms of where geographically today, I will say the majority come from the U.S., and we have seen some -- the pipeline development in APAC and Europe is a little bit behind, but -- so that we see what we will see this as a global market. So that's kind of our view. In terms of duration, it depends on the use case, we see from 2 to long duration storage, both the whole -- nothing below 2, but that's where we are.

David Arcaro
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then I was just curious about strong order intake in the quarter -- in this past quarter. I was wondering if you could talk to what the -- whether there's a common driver there that you're seeing. It doesn't seem to be data center growth just yet, if I'm interpreting that correctly. So what are you seeing in terms of what drove the strong rebound?

Julian Jose Marquez
President, CEO & Director

It was Australia the big driver of the strong quarter in '20, the strong order intake. We have these deals in Australia, as you know, that we were delayed in '25. We signed them all and they all -- most of them occur late in the year. So that's a big driver of it. But we see for '26, the U.S. being the big driver and a little bit of a change. And we'll see some -- I expect to see some data center stuff happening in '26 late in the year, most likely.

Our next question coming from the line of Mark Strouse with JPMorgan.

Mark W. Strouse
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I just wanted to go back to the second domestic content supplier. Ahmed, I think you said that your needs are met for the next couple of years. But I just wanted to clarify, is that capacity available today? Or is there kind of a ramp period that we should be expecting?

Ahmed Pasha
Senior VP & CFO

No. I think the capacity is available -- will be available in about next 10, 11 months. But I think the capacity that we need to serve our load, as we discussed during the call, we have about 85%, 90% of our revenue in our backlog, and we have already secured the capacity for that. So we don't need this capacity, but we are now locking in additional capacity to basically secure our future business.

Mark W. Strouse
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then on the long duration side, is Smartstack the only go-to-market solution that you have there? Are you potentially looking to partner up maybe being a systems integrator for some of the more emerging technologies that are out there?

Julian Jose Marquez
President, CEO & Director

Smartstack will be our accelerator. What we're going to do, and we believe that very competitive. So it will be Smartstack.

Operator

Our next question coming from the line of Christine Cho with Barclays.

Christine Cho
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

With respect to the data centers, you mentioned the 3 different ways that you can serve data centers, the interconnection backup and power quality. Would you be able to sort of like break down the opportunity set here and maybe rank it? Like is half of the opportunity for power quality and backup is the smallest? And for duration, you mentioned 2 hours is the low end. I'm assuming that's for power quality. Is it similar for those who are interested in getting storage for interconnection purposes?

Julian Jose Marquez
President, CEO & Director

Yes. First point, that's what -- that I would like to highlight. So we have these 3 needs. What's wonderful about our technology and now talking about battery storage, not necessarily ourselves, is that we can stack up these 3 needs with the same technology solution. While the other technology solutions can do one or the other, but they cannot do what we do, which is facilitate interconnection, do backup power and do quality. And that makes the difference. And I think that's what makes our solution so attractive to our data centers.

We can resolve 3 problems with one technology. So that's very, very good. In terms of the 2 hours, these are -- depends on the need of the customer. So I cannot really put out -- can tell you this is what drives it. But generally, you're right on the view that backup power and interconnection flexibility will tend to be longer duration, while power quality will tend to be shorter duration. Generally that's true. But I think you need to think about this differently. Is the ability to serve the 3 needs with the same infrastructure. That's what we are aiming for because that's where I think that will make our technology, the preferred technology solution to resolve to address these problems.

Christine Cho
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And then if you are able to vertically integrate with AESC, how should we think about what the mix will be between the AESC supply and the second supplier? And with this second supplier, is a contract for a set amount of time? And then lastly, for your international projects, are you also diversifying your cell suppliers there?

Julian Jose Marquez
President, CEO & Director

We are -- we've always been diversified internationally. We're just being diversified locally. My view on this is that it is -- we convert any battery into a great technology solution. That's what we do as a company. So who the battery supplier is not as relevant. It shouldn't be as relevant. My customers shouldn't care and my financial investors shouldn't care. What I -- the real value we bring is the ability to make any battery great, no matter what. So that was my answer to it. I don't know what the mix will be. But as I said, for my customers, it will be irrelevant from a product delivery and capabilities, what batteries are produced.

Christine Cho
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

But for you, doesn't it matter in that if you are using AESC and you're vertically integrated, it's higher margin for you versus...

Julian Jose Marquez
President, CEO & Director

I care about my customers. That's what I lose. Yes we will figure out that part. But the important thing is the ability to [indiscernible] the route to success in meeting your customer needs. That's what drives the company. But you're right, we might be able to get a capture -- if we were to be vertically integrated, there will be more margin on one or the other, but my real -- the way to win is meet the customer needs. That's the way to win. Not -- if you try to optimize something else, you get -- you lose the side. Your customer needs and that drives profitability, that drives margin, that drives everything.

Our next question coming from the line of Justin Clare with ROTH Capital.

Justin Clare
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

So I just wanted to follow up on the second source of the cell supply here. So I think you mentioned it will be available in the next 10 to 11 months. So just at the beginning of the year, do you expect to depend on the source of cells from AESC for domestic U.S. projects until that second source is available? And then so I'm just trying to get at how important is it for you to resolve the challenges with the FIAC restrictions by early calendar 2026 in terms of thinking through the outlook for the year?

Julian Jose Marquez
President, CEO & Director

Very, very important. That's what I will say. We have a plan, and we've been working on it, and it's very, very important to do it. So that's what I can tell you. I mean, we will get it done.

Justin Clare
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Got it. Good to hear. And then just a follow-up on the data center opportunity. I was wondering, are you seeing -- or could you talk about the ability to kind of successfully accelerate interconnection with storage being added to data centers? Is this being done today? Or do you need the regulatory framework to change in order to support this use case? And then wondering what the timing of orders associated with that use case might be?

Julian Jose Marquez
President, CEO & Director

We haven't signed any of these contracts yet. So this is a work in progress, but we believe we can -- we have the ability to ensure that the data centers meet the interconnection restrictions that they have. So I would say yes. I don't think you need a major regulatory change. It's just ensure that you meet whatever the grid is offering.
