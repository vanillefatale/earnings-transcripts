Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And the first question today will be coming from the line of Aaron Grey of Alliance Global Partners. Please go ahead.

Aaron Grey
Alliance Global Partners, Research Division

I see some more of the cash flow generation. First question for me. I just want to kind of strip out some of the one-offs to make sure we have a good understanding of how best to think about the business going forward. So particularly for Cannabis Operations, included the write-offs for inventory within that. So I just want to clarify there from the prepared remarks. Was it only the $3.9 million inventory in the gross margin and the $1.6 million fixed asset, that's SG&A and not in gross margin? So I want to clarify that point.

And then secondly, how best to think about the gross margin specifically for the Cannabis Operations going forward? Both of those are added back, it gets you back to that 29% gross margin from prior quarter. If just inventory, gets you more to the mid-20s. So I just want to get a better understanding of how to think about that on a go-forward basis.

Alberto Paredero-Quiros
Chief Financial Officer

So yes, I confirm the $3.9 million of inventory adjustments that's obviously is impacting gross profit. And it has an impact of about 10.6 percentage points in the margin of the segment. The other onetime adjustments that we saw in the quarter is the Stelletton facility impairment, it's a $2.7 million charge, that happened below gross profit. So it's in other income and expenses. So it's part of operating income, but not reflected in the gross margin. So the total of those 2 things obviously are impacting operating income, but the only impact to gross profit is based on the inventory adjustment. Without those adjustments, we would have been at around 25% margin in the segment, which is what we're expecting. We have seen in round about that number in the last couple of quarters, and we're expecting that to be the low end of the range for the future.

Aaron Grey
Alliance Global Partners, Research Division

Okay. Great. Sales to provincial boards saw some nice growth both on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. Any specific drivers there? And anything to think about in terms of the mix within that shipment timing for how we think about that line segment going forward? Because it does seem like that growth outpaced some of what we're seeing from the third-party POS data.

Alberto Paredero-Quiros
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, indeed, we're seeing the same softness overall in the sales to the provincial boards from Cannabis Operations. We know that it's not driven by our own segment as we continue to gain momentum there, and we'll continue to see growth. But we have seen some softness in third-party retail. Obviously, we don't have full visibility to the inventory numbers of the provincial boards. So an element of the slowdown could be as well driven by that. But overall, that we have seen over the last couple of quarters, a slowdown in third-party retail, that we're working on, obviously trying to create some additional momentum and with the changes in new products and innovation, we believe that we're going to be regaining momentum there.

Zachary George
CEO & Non Independent Director

And just to add to Alberto's comments. We are seeing great progress in specific categories, including edibles, pre-roll and vape. And so that's enabled us to keep a great pace relative to the broader market.

Aaron Grey
Alliance Global Partners, Research Division

Okay. Great. Last 1 for me. I know you've been increasing your efforts internationally. I think you said 4.2% in the quarter. So how best to think about international sales going forward, how big of a part of the business do you feel like that could be within the next 12 to 18 months?

Alberto Paredero-Quiros
Chief Financial Officer

It does keep to -- continue to gain momentum. We have been increasing quarterly-over-quarter since the beginning of the year. We have a strong demand. We have a lot of purchase orders for the fourth quarter as well. We are bullish as well with the outlook for 2026. A lot of our international partners, they are exploring options to continue increasing purchases from us. They're struggling with reliability of supply from some of their other partners that they have, and they have been very pleased with our performance so far. So yes, we believe and we're anticipating that, that number will continue growing in the future.

Zachary George
CEO & Non Independent Director

Worth mentioning that we are continuing to ramp production at our Atholville, New Brunswick facility. The benefits from extremely attractive relative power pricing. And so we should see monthly production based on our targets north of 15,000 kilograms a month in 2026. And so we expect the bulk of that biomass to be directed at international markets. And there are a number of other both 2.0 and other growth opportunities that we're looking at.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question will be coming from the line of Frederico Gomes of ATB Capital Markets.

Frederico Yokota Gomes
ATB Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

First question just on the 1CM transaction that still hasn't closed. You said you're waiting regulatory approval in Ontario. So is there anything specific that's been an issue with that approval. I'm just thinking about the previous history year back when you had the [ Indiva ] transaction, and I believe that there was a hold up there in Ontario. So just any comments on that?

Zachary George
CEO & Non Independent Director

Fred, we don't have any additional information to share. We thought this would be -- the review would be completed late October. It's early November. There are a number of retail licenses, both applications that have been submitted by affiliated entities as well as third parties that are still moving to the pipeline in Ontario. So we'll update the market as soon as we have greater clarity.

Frederico Yokota Gomes
ATB Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

And then second question, just on Cannabis Retail. I guess we saw good same-store sales growth this quarter again, record numbers in gross profit, operating income as well. Just broader comments about what you're seeing in that market right now? Are you seeing opportunities to increase prices and margins? Are you seeing a good pipeline of M&A? Or is it going to be concentrated more on organic growth, obviously, excluding the 1CM transaction? Just some broader color on the outlook for Cannabis Retail in Canada right now.

Zachary George
CEO & Non Independent Director

It's a great question. We are seeing maturity. It's really a province-by-province assessment. We've seen extreme saturation start to settle in Alberta. And as you well know, Frederico, Alberta was 1 of the quickest provinces out of the gate in terms of its pace of door count growth. You're seeing signs emerging of maturity in markets like Ontario as well, although there's still -- we still think there's opportunity there. And I think that the days of easy kind of double-digit, high single-digit same-store sales growth upon opening locations and managing a discount retail strategy are going to be in the rearview very quickly. Execution on the floor and owning the consumer relationship with a very convenient and attractive experience for customers is critical at this point. So we are very much focused on our consumer and owning that relationship.

Alberto Paredero-Quiros
Chief Financial Officer

I would add, Frederico, if you compare to the same period of last year, you have probably noticed in the third quarter that our same-store sales have slowed down somewhat compared to first half of the year. On the other side, we're seeing a significant increase, a 90 basis points improvement in gross margin. The main reason last year, as of the third quarter, we started to run more aggressive promotional activities. That obviously put a little bit the top line but tempered the gross margin. as we are lapping that strong promo activity this year, we're seeing the margin progression, obviously somehow a little bit of a slowdown on same store sales revenue growth. It will probably be a similar dynamic in the fourth quarter, but we still see some -- we've seen margins somewhat stabilizing for the long run. There is always an opportunity to increase efficiencies and manage mix a little bit better and gain marginally on the gross margin. But clearly, yes, as Zach said, on the revenue growth and the market growth, we're assuming -- we're expecting it would stay in the low single digits going forward.

Frederico Yokota Gomes
ATB Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

That's very helpful. And then just a final question, just, I guess, related to that as well, just on the Rise Rewards program, now that you have some more time with that. Anything you can share in terms of how the rollout is occurring relative to your expectations? And any data points regarding members of the program, economics, et cetera?

Zachary George
CEO & Non Independent Director

Frederico, we're still early days. We're just several months into this launch, but it is tracking quite well. The engagement we're getting from loyalty members is extremely strong. We're excited to roll out a similar and parallel program for our Liquor business in the coming quarters and think that there'll be an interesting opportunity and some very rich data that we can receive from that. We're going to update the market on this program, but wanted to get a couple of quarters of performance underneath our belt before sharing more detailed stats.
