[Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Alyssa DeStefano with KBW.

Bose George
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

This is Bose with KBW. The first question, could you give us an update on mark-to-market book values?

David Finkelstein
CEO, Co-Chief investment Officer & Director

Sure, Bose. So as of Tuesday, our book was up 4%, inclusive of the dividend accrual so 3% netting that out after yesterday, maybe a fraction of 1% higher than that.

Bose George
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. And then can you just talk about the portfolio returns or the blended ROEs on the portfolio given the spread tightening since quarter end? And then can you just translate that into a comfort level with your dividend in 2026.

David Finkelstein
CEO, Co-Chief investment Officer & Director

Sure. So overall, we could still achieve an upwards of mid-teens returns. When we look at the Agency market, obviously, we've gotten a considerable amount of tightening. But versus swaps, you still get there. And we're confident in the durability of the swaps market as a hedge given the fact that the Fed's obviously, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, much more considerate of balance sheet availability. And we haven't really tightened that much or rather -- sorry, widen that much since that announcement. So we feel like the swaps market is a perfectly good place to hedge and you can get that return.

In the resi market, the whole loan channel to securitization is still giving us those returns. MSR is a little bit lighter. But when you consider the hedging benefits and diversification benefits will take that. And then when you look at our overall balance sheet, where we own assets is very supportive of the dividend yield. So we feel good about it. We outearned in Q4. We expect outearned certainly in Q1, and we feel like the dividend is safe here.

And our next question today comes from Jason Stewart at Compass Point.

Jason Stewart
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Obviously, on the MSR portfolio, the current portfolio is pretty well insulated from modestly lower interest rates. But could you expand on your comment about being opportunistic for coupon MSR and how you're expecting that market to trade as prepays increase?

David Finkelstein
CEO, Co-Chief investment Officer & Director

Sure. I'll hand it off to Ken for that.

Ken Adler
Head of Mortgage Servicing Rights & Portfolio Analytics

Yes. I mean we've now set up the infrastructure to be fully active in that space. And the primary way we've done that is through the Fannie and Freddie MSR exchange platforms. And we're now active with close to 100 counterparties today, and we provide pricing every day. What's really interesting about new production pricing is it really doesn't move that much with interest rates because it's always set at the current mortgage rate. So really, what it is, is about the value change after you buy it, I think. And given the improved ability to do recapture for the industry, that's been much more insulated than it's been in past regimes. So we're there, and we don't see it as valuable to us at this time based on where we can buy the lower note rate stuff. So to the extent relative value changes and that becomes more attractive, you will see us more active in that area.

David Finkelstein
CEO, Co-Chief investment Officer & Director

Yes. And I'll just add, Jason, to the extent we're a financial participant, the low note rate MSR has worked well and let the operating platforms, the originators focus on production coupon and their management of the borrower, but we do expect origination obviously, to pick up a lot this year with a 6% mortgage rate. And so as a consequence, you'll see a lot of production coupon MSR hitting the market. And we've gotten comfortable, very comfortable with our recapture partners at our servicers to where we can manage that quite well. So we'll see how the market develops, but we'd like to get more into the production MSR space.

Jason Stewart
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And just 1 more point on that. How much would you need to see valuations change for it to hit return hurdles in terms of current coupon production.

Ken Adler
Head of Mortgage Servicing Rights & Portfolio Analytics

Yes. Well, what's going on is when originators sell MSRs, they want to sell the MSR that's least valuable to them. And that is the lower note rate MSR because there's a lower chance that customer is going to become active. So in today's world, when they originate and Dave alluded to this in the prepared comments, when they originate a loan, the profitability on that origination does not allow MSR retention to retain all the MSR. In fact, they have to sell a majority of the MSR to be liquidity neutral.

So what we're seeing is originators prefer to sell the lower note rate MSR so that's more valuable to us because that's what they're selling. We expect that flow to dry up and then the relative value shifts to the current coupon. But also, as Dave alluded to, we're well set up based on network of people to buy from and then a network of people to both subservice and perform recapture for us.

And our next question today comes from Eric Hagen at BTIG.

Eric Hagen
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Lots of speculation out there right now for things the administration can do to lower mortgage rates further, including a potential cut to guarantee fees. I mean can you weigh in on this? And how you think a big G-fee cut could impact the prepayment environment?

David Finkelstein
CEO, Co-Chief investment Officer & Director

Sure. So obviously, a G-fee cut is something that's been talked about. Our view -- and we've been communicated about this to policymakers is that a G-fee cut on purchased loans is perfectly appropriate. We're concerned that if you do broad G-fee cut and impact existing loans, you're going to damage the MBS market and widen spreads. And I think that there's been an awareness of that. And furthermore, if you can find it to purchase loans, you don't negatively impact the ROEs of the GSEs, and that's certainly a consideration. So perhaps they do something like give it a year holiday on purchased loans, we think that would make sense to help first-time homeowners and new buyers get into the housing market.

Eric Hagen
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Okay. That's great. You mentioned the cost of hedging should be lower as a result of the GSEs being back in the market, spread volatility being lower. I mean what metric would you use to maybe like compare the cost of hedging over time? And how would you maybe compare the attractiveness of raising capital when spreads are widened kind of more attractive versus an environment of tighter spreads and lower spread volatility?

David Finkelstein
CEO, Co-Chief investment Officer & Director

Yes. So the first question in terms of measuring spread volatility, like here is our view as it relates to the GSEs and their involvement. We don't have a lot of clarity. We know there's a $200 billion mandate, but we don't know what role the GSEs are going to play. I think it would be highly productive if they evolved into a spread stabilizing force for the MBS market, and that was somewhat of the role they played pre-financial crisis. And it gave investors' confidence that mortgage spreads would remain relatively stable. And as a consequence, it incentivize participation in the market. And then overall, given higher participation, you got a tighter spread as a consequence of others doing the work for the GSEs because you knew that they would be there when they got too wide and provide support for the market.

And they also were economically focused and sold when mortgages were tight. That would be a good outcome. They clearly don't have the capacity that they did pre-financial crisis but they got a lot of dry powder. So we'd like to see that evolution, but we'll have to wait to see. In terms of measuring spreads, in volatility, spread vol has been very stable for the last 6 months, and it's been quite comforting. We haven't had to spend a lot of money at all hedging and you see that in our economic return. So we feel quite good about that. And then Srini, you want to dive into your second question again -- second part of your question again, Eric?

Eric Hagen
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Sure. Yes, we're just looking at how you might compare the attractiveness of raising capital in the different spread environments.

David Finkelstein
CEO, Co-Chief investment Officer & Director

So look, I'll jump in there, and then Srini can add. When spreads were extraordinarily wide. It was obviously a catalyst to raise capital because there was a tremendous amount of upside. Compare that to today, where spreads are meaningfully tighter, obviously, from a relative value standpoint, it doesn't look as attractive. But when you consider the fact that the stability of spreads is higher, it gives you some confidence. But candidly, if I had to choose between 1 environment or over the other, I'd rather have wider spreads, with a little bit more uncertainty in terms of raising capital. So from that standpoint, I would expect that the pace of capital raising may not be as high as in that environment.

But nonetheless, the amount of support for the Agency market, given the fact that you have very strong technicals from obviously the GSEs, but also money managers, REITs raising capital, et cetera. That's quite comforting. And to the earlier part of the question about volatility, where the cycle lows, and that's supported by what we're seeing day-to-day in markets. Another point to note is that the Fed is shoring up balance sheet, as I talked about in my prepared remarks and in Bose's question, the fact that the Fed went from QT to adding reserves in the system is a very good sign for balance sheet intensive products, whether it's treasuries or Agency MBS, the ability to finance is key. And I think it's been a little bit underappreciated. So the Agency market is a safe place right now. It's just that spreads are obviously at the tight end of the range. They're close to QE type levels. The safety of those returns is there, but the abundance of yield is not quite there.

V.S. Srinivasan
Head of Agency

And going forward, there could be pockets of opportunity if we get more clarity on what policy changes come about, post the GSE announcement to purchase MBS, higher coupons really have not tightened that much because that has increased policy uncertainty. So as we get some clarity there, there could be pockets of opportunity.

And our next question today comes from Doug Harter at UBS.

Douglas Harter
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

David, you were just talking about the lower risk environment that we're in today. I guess as you look out, like how do you handicap the risks that, that could change, what might be the factors that could cause kind of an end to this low-risk environment with more volatility.

David Finkelstein
CEO, Co-Chief investment Officer & Director

Sure. From a macro standpoint, then I'll drill down a little bit on the mortgage market. But the 2 biggest risks that we see are the global fiscal picture and the amount of debt out there, including that in the United States and a little bit of complacency around it, and you could end up with the vol environment because of the amount of debt in the world. And I think it's probably under-recognized the risk of that. And another macro risk is just the euphoria in asset markets and asset pricing. It's been a pretty remarkable run across markets, and there's real signs out there that people should be -- investors should be a little bit concerned. Just look at the price of gold as a safety store of value. It's doubled since the beginning of last year and up 27%, 28% this year. So I think there's some nervousness out there, and it's a little bit hard to invest and we could get a correction broadly in assets.

Now as it relates to the Agency market, specifically in our markets, valuation as well is a risk. We are at the very tight end of the range on Agency MBS. It's justified given the facts I mentioned earlier, but nonetheless, they're relatively tight. Another risk as Eric discussed is housing policy uncertainty and what role the GSEs will play and what the administration will do to potentially increase affordability and how that could impact the convexity profile of the Agency market. So those are 2 things we're watching quite closely in terms of risks in the Agency market specifically.

And our next question today comes from Rick Shane at JPMorgan.

Richard Shane
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Look, you guys are seeing attractive opportunities buying MSRs, low coupon MSRs. I assume you're basically seeing that as an attractive IO. Given discounts in MBS for lower coupons, does it make sense? Is it attractive to be buying lower coupon MBS at this point as well. I'm just curious, particularly as sort of on the margin, you're starting to get more questions about prepayment.

David Finkelstein
CEO, Co-Chief investment Officer & Director

Yes, you're just saying as a hedge to our MSR and the runoff.

Richard Shane
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Exactly. Give yourself an opportunity to pick up some discount accretion if speeds pick up and also potentially is an attractive yield.

David Finkelstein
CEO, Co-Chief investment Officer & Director

Yes. And look, the first point I'd note is that the valuation on low coupon MBS is quite tight. So there's better ways, I think, to manage that type of risk, whether it be through duration or other factors. There's a little bit of policy risk in low note rate MSR, but we feel it's very safe. And I think when it comes to housing policy changes, you could see legislation that reduces capital gains tax so you could get some turnover in low coupon MSR but those are at the margin. Otherwise, I think the borrower in a 3-odd percent note rate loan really ascribes the value to that loan, and there's some real reluctance to give it up. So we do feel like it's a safe durable asset and we do hedge some of that uncertainty through duration but to couple it with low coupon MBS. And we do have some, and that is obviously a consideration, Rick, but the valuations just don't warrant it.

Richard Shane
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And is there enough liquidity in the lower coupons that if you felt like there -- the bid-ask was attractive that you could deploy capital there? Or is it -- and that's a nuance just as equity guys, I don't think -- at least I fully appreciate.

David Finkelstein
CEO, Co-Chief investment Officer & Director

Yes. Yes. And there is liquidity in low coupons. It's not as good as production and slightly higher. But if you wanted to compile a bigger position in local bonds, it wouldn't be hard. I mentioned we added DUS to the portfolio, Agency CMBS. In our view, relative to lower coupon MBS that was meaningfully cheaper. And so to get a good convexity profile and longer duration assets that was sufficient for us last quarter.

Richard Shane
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Okay. That makes sense because that's got a super low prepayment characteristics because those are...

David Finkelstein
CEO, Co-Chief investment Officer & Director

Exactly. Locked out.

And our next question today comes from Harsh Hemnani with Green Street.

Harsh Hemnani
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Thank you. So I think on the prepared remarks, you characterized the current environment as spreads have tightened across all housing finance assets, but unevenly. And it seems like credit is starting to look a little bit more attractive on a relative value basis and we saw that section of the portfolio grow a little faster than the rest of the businesses this quarter. I guess, as you look out over the next year or so, your long-term target for the equity allocation is like 60% Agency MBS and 20% across the other 2 each. Can you help us put some bands around that? How much could we see credit exposure or MSR even increase from your -- over that 20% number?

David Finkelstein
CEO, Co-Chief investment Officer & Director

Sure. And I did allude to this, Harsh, so thank you for the question. So in 2025, we grew the Agency portfolio of 30% each resi and MSR by 15% through the capital raises that we undertook. And that was the right weighting to go with, given how well Agency has done. So we're perfectly happy with it. But now we're at a little bit of a different balance when it comes to valuations, and we do from a capital allocation perspective, favor resi credit, even though it has tightened and MSR for that matter. And we like those percentages if we did add capital to switch. We'd like to grow resi and MSR 30% and Agency, less than that. So the objective today from a capital allocation standpoint is to increase MSR and resi.

It's episodic in terms of the opportunities, notwithstanding the consistency of the pipeline for our whole loan correspondent channel, but we would like to grow those businesses. And we've said in the past that the longer term weighting we would like to achieve is 50% Agency, not below that and 30% resi, 20% MSR. We don't have to get there right away, but that is an objective. We have to be very considerate with respect to the credit environment. But nonetheless, when you look at the health of the loans we're acquiring, and our portfolio, we're very comfortable with the credit we're doing. And so we're hopeful we can grow it. And I don't expect us to get to those objectives over the near term in terms of down to 50% Agency, but we'd like to at the margin increase MSR and resi here.

And our next question comes from Trevor Cranston of Citizens JMP.

Trevor Cranston
Citizens JMP Securities, LLC, Research Division

You talked some about the impact of the GSE portfolio buying on the market. I was curious if you could share your views on the likelihood or feasibility of the portfolio caps potentially being increased at some point as they get closer to current cap size? And then also, I was just curious if you guys have seen or if you expect to see any impact from their portfolio buying on the swap or funding markets?

David Finkelstein
CEO, Co-Chief investment Officer & Director

Yes. So as it relates to the caps, it's hard to say. Obviously, everybody probably saw that post from the FHFA Director last Friday, I believe it was talking about they don't intend to increase the caps, but we just don't know. But when you look today, they came into the year with, I think it's $178 billion in capacity between the 2 of them. So we're a long ways away from hitting those caps, and we'll see how it evolves. But we don't have a good answer as to whether or not those caps will actually be increased. Obviously, they can do it in conjunction with treasury and it doesn't require Congress. So we'll have to wait and see how the year evolves on that front. And sorry, the second part of your question, Trevor. Hedging, yes.

Trevor Cranston
Citizens JMP Securities, LLC, Research Division

Yes. Whether you're seeing any impact from the GSE buying on swap markets.

David Finkelstein
CEO, Co-Chief investment Officer & Director

Not as much. You could argue that swap spreads should be wider given the adjustments the Fed has made with respect to their asset purchases, and we didn't get, as I mentioned earlier, a meaningful amount of widening based on the greater availability of balance sheet. And it could indicate some involvement from the GSEs. We don't have information on that. I do know from our experience pre-financial crisis, and I was on the sell side interacting quite extensively with the GSEs. If past is prologue in terms of how they behave, they would hedge those purchases and use swaps because that will enhance the yield relative to shorting treasuries, for example, and they can get a decent ROE out of it.

So we would expect that to be the case whether they're actively engaged in the swaps market today. I don't have a good answer for their involvement. And as it relates to funding markets, the GSEs are active participants in the funding markets with their liquidity and their capital during parts of the month and their absence might be a factor. However, what I would say is that they're buying MBS, which is a balance sheet-intensive product, and is funded in many circumstances. So they're taking assets out of the market that might otherwise be funded. And so even though they're not providing as much liquidity in the repo market that should offset -- the asset purchases should offset the lack of funding. And really what matters, I think, in terms of funding markets is reserves in the system. And that's the key factor we look at, and they're now back to slightly over $1 trillion -- or $3 trillion, and we feel like funding markets are still going to be fine without their participation. And Srini, you got another point.

V.S. Srinivasan
Head of Agency

The 1 thing I would add is just the size of the GSE book. I mean if they bought the entire $200 billion, it's about $100 million DV01 so if you assume they have done 5% or 10%, you're talking about $5 million, $10 million DV01, it's just not large enough for you to see any impact on swaps spreads right away. It will take time.
