Thank you, Jody, and good day to everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Gilat's third quarter of 2025 results. Please note that we are posting a PowerPoint presentation on our website with all the data we will discuss today.

The third quarter of 2025 was a strong quarter for Gilat and showed strong revenue, including solid organic growth and adjusted EBITDA performance. Our competitive edge across the satellite communication landscape and success in next-generation satellite programs is clearly translating directly into new orders and growing opportunities.

During the quarter, we announced a $66 million private placement from institutional and accredited investors. This demonstrates the confidence of the investment community in Gilat's strategy and performance, providing additional strength to support our next phase of growth.

At the end of the quarter, we had a very strong cash position, [indiscernible] an example of our efforts to create a competitive edge in our first-to-market integration of AI into our Network Management System. This marks an important step in bringing AI-driven automation and intelligence to satellite network operations, allowing customers to manage their network with greater efficiency and insight. It reflects our commitment to innovation and our active role in shaping the future of intelligent SATCOM solutions. We expect to introduce additional AI capabilities as we progress with our road map development. Third quarter revenues reached $117.7 million, a 58% increase year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $15.6 million, 46% above the same quarter last year.

Now on to the business review. Gilat Defense continued to invest in sales, marketing and R&D resources to support business development. Gilat Defense is front and center, actively engaging with customers across North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. Our unique advantage lies in the combined strengths of Gilat DataPath, Wavestream and Stellar Blu. This collaboration enable us to deliver comprehensive SATCOM solutions that supports the full spectrum of Defense operations.

During the quarter, Gilat Defense received over $14 million in orders through a prime contractor for its DKET terminals from the U.S. Army and the Department of Defense, broadening our presence across key defense programs. In Israel, Gilat Defense strengthened its relationship with the Israeli Ministry of Defense through a new multimillion dollar contract for the delivery and integration of satellite communication systems and services.

With a robust pipeline, trusted partnership and proven execution, we are well positioned to capture additional opportunities as global demand for secure satellite communication continue to rise.

Turning to our Commercial business. The third quarter delivered strong results driven by new wins, continued adoption of our next-generation platforms and steady execution across major programs. These results reflect both the rapid evolution of the satellite communication market and Gilat's ability to deliver technology and performance our customers require.

Operators worldwide are investing in flexible multi-orbit ground networks that can seamlessly support fixed broadband mobility and government applications. Gilat's SkyEdge IV platform remains central to this transformation, combining scalability, reliability and advanced network management via virtualized software-defined ground infrastructure.

During the quarter, Gilat received $42 million in orders from a leading global satellite operator for SkyEdge IV for use across multiple applications, mainly in-flight connectivity. These systems will expand the worldwide deployment of our platform and strengthen Gilat's position as a preferred choice for next-generation connectivity in multi-orbit environment. Demand continued to build for Gilat's IFC solutions as airlines and system integrators expand adoption of our technology for next-generation aircraft connectivity.

Recently, we received an order of approximately $7 million to supply IFC equipment. This order demonstrates the growing trust of leading aviation partners in Gilat to deliver reliable, high-performance connectivity for IFC. During the quarter, Gilat signed a strategic partnership agreement and received an initial order for SkyEdge IV from a leading satellite operator in Asia Pacific region, supporting both fixed and cellular backhaul connectivity.

Together, these wins highlight strong market confidence in our technology and reinforce our position as a key enabler of multi-orbit broadband connectivity worldwide. Gilat was awarded more than $60 million in orders from a leading satellite operator for its Stellar Blu's Sidewinder ESA IFC terminal. With about 300,000 community flight hours and about 350 terminals already deployed, the Sidewinder continued to set new benchmarks for performance, reliability and passenger experience.

Production is ramping up, and we expect increased deliveries with improved margins in the coming quarters. Gilat Stellar Blu continues to collaborate closely with its partners to secure new fleet wins and expand its global reach. The growing pipeline in our Commercial business continued to benefit from demand momentum and expanding customer adoption across key markets. Combination of major satellite operators awards, growing IFC demand and the integration of Stellar Blu testify to Gilat's leadership in next-generation connectivity, positioning us well continued growth into 2026.

Gilat Peru delivered strong results this quarter, marked by an additional award of $25 million for an expansion project from Pronatel. This is on top of the $60 million projects awarded to us that was reported at the beginning of the quarter for a quarterly total of $85 million. The new awards will extend high-speed connectivity to additional public institutions, including schools, health centers and police stations as well as public Wi-Fi hotspots, further advancing Peru's digital inclusion goals. The impact of this project goes beyond connectivity, supporting access to education, health care and public safety while creating the infrastructure needed for future broadband expansion. The project implementation is progressing on schedule, and we continue to anticipate additional large RFPs and follow-on orders for network expansions and renewals in the coming quarters. The experience and expertise gained in Peru are also being applied globally, allowing us to replicate successful models and accelerate digital inclusion programs in other markets.

I am pleased to say that we continue to have a strong backlog and a healthy pipeline of opportunities in all divisions. On the strength of our results year-to-date, improved visibility and business momentum, we are resetting our full year guidance. We are narrowing our revenue range to between $445 million to $455 million for a higher revenue growth rate of approximately 47% at the midpoint. We've also narrowed our adjusted EBITDA guidance range, now targeting $51 million to $53 million for a higher growth rate of approximately 23% at the midpoint. Demand across our key markets is accelerating and the strategic initiatives we have implemented are delivering measurable results.

Gilat Defense continued to develop opportunities as government expand investment in mission-critical secure satellite communications. Our focus remains on converting the growing pipeline into new awards in the United States and allied countries.

In the Commercial division, we are seeing broader adoption of our multi-orbit SkyEdge IV platform as operators scale their next-generation networks and invest in advanced broadband and IFC applications.

Gilat Stellar Blu is making steady progress as production increases and new fleet wins are secured, further strengthening our position in the global aviation connectivity market.

In Peru, project execution remains on track, and we continue to expect additional RFPs and follow-on awards from Pronatel and other public programs. The operational expertise developed in Peru continues to serve as the foundation for similar digital inclusion initiatives globally.

In summary, we delivered another strong quarter, successfully validating our diversified growth engines across Defense, Commercial and Peru. Gilat is actively strengthening its competitive edge through technological leadership in multi-orbit connectivity and the integration of SkyEdge IV and AI. With a growing backlog, a robust pipeline of opportunities, particularly in the IFC market and a strong balance sheet, Gilat is well positioned for sustained profitable growth and continued leadership in the global SATCOM market.

And with that, I will hand over the call over to Gil Benyamini, our CFO. Gil, please go ahead.

Gil Benyamini
Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Adi. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone. Before I dive into the numbers, I would like to remind everyone that our financial results are presented both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.

I will now walk through our financial highlights for the third quarter of 2025. As Adi mentioned, we delivered a strong third quarter, demonstrating continued execution across our strategic priorities and building momentum into the remainder of the year. In terms of our financial results, revenues for the third quarter were $117.7 million, representing 58% growth compared to $74.6 million in Q3 '24. Importantly, our organic growth quarter-over-quarter was 19%.

In terms of revenue breakdown by segment, Q3 '25 revenues for the Commercial segment were $73 million compared to $33.8 million in the same quarter last year. The 116% growth was primarily driven by the in-flight connectivity vertical, reflect both the contribution from Stellar Blu and organic expansion.

Q3 '25 revenue for the Defense segment were $24.1 million compared to $31 million in the same quarter last year. The decrease primarily reflects the transition from mature programs to new programs and initiatives that are currently in [indiscernible] phase. We secured a number of meaningful orders and awards that are expected to convert to revenues over the coming quarters. As a reminder, our Defense business is inherently project-based with deliveries and revenue recognition occurring over time. Looking ahead, we expect to see growth in this segment as these newer programs continue to scale.

Revenues for Peru in Q3 '25 were $20.6 million, more than double than the $9.8 million in Q3 '24. The increase was driven by higher revenues related to the new upgrade projects in 4 of the 6 regions in which we operate as well as increased equipment deliveries.

Our GAAP gross margin in Q3 '25 was 30% compared to 37% in Q3 '24. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower margins at Stellar Blu as production ramps up as well as the amortization of purchased intangibles related to the acquisition. GAAP operating expenses in Q3 '25 were $27.2 million compared to $20.9 million in Q3 '24. The increase was primarily driven by the addition of Stellar Blu and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. As a result, GAAP operating income in Q3 '25 was $7.5 million compared to GAAP operating income of $6.7 million in Q3 '24. GAAP net income in Q3 '25 was $8.1 million or a diluted income per share of $0.14 compared to GAAP net income of $6.8 million or a diluted income per share of $0.12 in Q3 '24.

Moving to non-GAAP results. Our non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 '25 was 32% compared to 38% in Q3 '24. Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q3 '25 were $24.7 million compared to $20.2 million in Q3 '24. Non-GAAP operating income in Q3 '25 was $12.8 million compared to $8.3 million in Q3 '24. The non-GAAP net income in Q3 '25 was $11.8 million or a diluted income per share of $0.19 compared to a net income of $8.1 million or income per share of $0.14 in Q3 '24. Adjusted EBITDA in Q3 '25 was $15.6 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA of $10.7 million in Q3 '24.

Moving to our balance sheet. We strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity during the last quarter. In September '25, the company raised $66 million from leading institutional and accredited investors in Israel. In January '25, we secured a $100 million credit line from a bank consortium, of which $60 million was used to finance the acquisition of Stellar Blu. The company also generated more than $28 million in cash from operating activities during this quarter. As a result, as of September 30, '25, total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $155 million or approximately $94.6 million net of loans compared to $5.5 million on June 30, '25.

DSOs, which exclude receivables and revenues of our terrestrial network construction projects in Peru were 63 days, similar to the previous quarter. Our shareholders' equity as of September 30, '25 totaled $391 million compared with $316 million on June 30, '25.

Looking ahead, reflecting our strong performance and visibility into the remainder of the year, we're narrowing our guidance range and raising the guidance midpoint for both revenues and EBITDA. Revenue is now expected to be between $445 million and $455 million, representing year-over-year growth of 47% at the midpoint. The adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $51 million and $53 million, representing year-over-year growth of 23% at the midpoint.

That concludes my financial review. I would now like to open the call for questions. Operator, please go ahead.
