I just -- I wanted to dig in a little bit on the opportunities around value-added services, but specifically, around purpose-built offerings for events. So here, we're really talking about the Olympics and World Cup given that value-added services is a much bigger part of the business today than the last time that occurred.

Ryan McInerney
CEO & Director

Yes. So see if I hit the sore of the question, Dan. So we -- first of all, let me start with the sponsorship assets that we have. They're obviously marquee sponsorship partnerships, talking about, for example, this year, FIFA, this year, Winter Olympics, global -- very, very global in nature. And what we have through our sponsorships is the ability to pass through those rights to our clients and partners all over the world, and that's what we do. .

Our value-added services sales teams go to market. They sit with our clients many, many months in advance of these programs, and they design programs that are bespoke and custom built for our clients to help them grow their businesses.

So for some clients, those might be advertising campaigns that we developed together with them in support of maybe a sweepstakes for their cardholders, things like that. For other clients, they might want to create client events for their private banking clients at one of the FIFA games in the U.S., Canada or Mexico. So in that example, our team works with them to build bespoke events, obviously branded for the bank or financial institution and those types of things. So it's a very busy time of year for us -- it's a very busy year for us. There is a ton of demand from our clients.

And the great thing about this is not only are we helping our clients, not only are we generating revenue from these services, we're deepening our partnerships with our clients. And so we get more renewals because of them, we get more business because of them. And so we feel really good about it.

Our next caller is Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.

Darrin Peller

Maybe we just touch on what you're seeing strength and that's actually -- it seems like it's offsetting the lower-than-expected FX volatility such that you're able to maintain your full year guide for revenue growth. I know VAS and CMS seems to be standing out pretty well. And just if I can just throw one more about capital return. Have you guys thought through any change just given where the market is placing valuations now over capital allocation, buybacks, maybe it is picking up a notch?

Christopher Suh
Chief Financial Officer

Darrin, yes, let me jump in. Value-added services, in particular, we saw in Q1 really great performance, strong execution strong client demand. Ryan talked about some of that around some of the events, but the strength was really quite broad-based. We saw strong growth year-over-year in all 4 of the portfolios that we talk about, issuing solutions, acceptance, risk and security and advisory. The team continues to execute very well across that.

And so when we think about the performance and then, of course, CMS had a very high growth quarter as well, performing above what we expected. So when we think about the full year expectations, those are the moving parts that we talked about we said volatility -- obviously, it's hard to determine where that's going to go. But given the persistent low that we saw in Q1, if we extend that throughout the rest of the year, that does provide for more downside than our original expectation, but that is being offset by strong performance that we saw in Q1. And the momentum that we have in the business that we anticipate will continue throughout the rest of the year, and those 2 become largely offsetting.

To your second point around capital return, as you know, Darrin, our approach to capital return and share buyback has largely been programmatic. We've executed on that very consistently throughout our history. But at the same time, we do take advantage when we see opportunities when we think the market is underpricing our stock, and we see an opportunity we'll lean in as well, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to do that as well.

I wanted to ask just the obligatory question on the regulatory environment. CCCA has been in the news quite a bit. Just if you could share your updated thoughts on how you're thinking about, I guess, the risk of the business from that potentially going forward as well as how you're thinking about recent conversations on the Hill and the likelihood of that becoming a reality.

Ryan McInerney
CEO & Director

Will, you cut a little out when you asked about the specific thing. Was it CCCA you mentioned or something else?

William Nance
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Yes, it was CCCA kind of affects implementation as well as recent conversations on the Hill and likelihood of passing. .

Ryan McInerney
CEO & Director

Yes. So as you'd expect, we're very engaged on the Hill. We're very engaged with members. As you know, well, there's many things floating around. And we view it as our job to educate elected representatives on the impacts that the various policies that are being floated around could have. In the case of CCCA specifically, we've talked extensively in this call and other places about our view, and it hasn't changed. It's very harmful and it's just simply not needed.

So when I have a chance to talk to elected officials and the rest of my leadership team does, like they're listening, their understanding, these people don't live in our industry every day. So they do need the time to understand it. When we talk to them about why it's not necessary, we explain the competitive environment in this business, it is intense. We have new players entering all the time. We talk on this call about crypto, stablecoins, BNPL. Obviously, all the competition in the credit card and debit card markets, wallet players, A2A, we take them through and explain this competitive environment.

And we also explained why the market is working so well, and there's no need for government intervention. The second thing we explained to was just how harmful it would be. I mean this legislation would have far reaching negative consequences at a time when the economy certainly doesn't need that. Consumers and small businesses would see reduced access to credit, rewards would be eliminated entirely. There will be fewer credit card options. And by the way, weaker security protections, less innovation, all these things we explain why.

So I think this is going to be part of what we all do regularly because there's elections, you have new elected officials. They're very busy with lots of other things. And so we just have to continue to remind them of the impacts, whether it's CCCA or anything else for that matter.

Nice results. Could you double click into the much better-than-expected growth in commercial and what you saw there if it was just a great quarter? Or did something unlock in a market with immense potential but I think previously, it was supposed to be a little bit more slow and steady. And then I would appreciate if you can provide just a quick perspective on spending trends around the world, maybe some color on what you're seeing in the major regions and to the extent you can some insight on affluent versus mass.

Ryan McInerney
CEO & Director

Chris, let me start a little bit on commercial from a business perspective, then you can follow up on the numbers and then you can hit the other question spending trends. Yes, I think what you're seeing in commercial is the results of the strategy we've been talking to you about now for -- really for a few years. And I think just a credit to our teams, like we've been shipping great product.

Our sales teams have been engaging with players all around the world, we've been winning. When we think about the commercial space, we've been talking with you all about 3 different types of opportunities, and we're having great success across all 3 of them. we talked about converting more small business and medium business spending. And what's an example, I'd point to there. I point to the Chase Sapphire Reserve for Business product. That was a portfolio win that we announced, a great product in the market that's doing exactly that.

And the second opportunity we talked about is scaling large and middle market card and virtual payables use cases. And again, that's an area where we've been shipping some great product and having some great client wins. I'd point to our Trip.com global virtual travel card issuing business. I think it's a great example there. And then the third opportunity -- the third leg of the strategy, and we've been talking to you all about is delivering product innovation and network flexibility to help our partners reach underpenetrated spend.

And I think it was maybe the last call or call before that, I mentioned our win at BMO up in Canada, where we launched our network-agnostic enhanced spend management capabilities with them, and that's going to allow them to really capture some of that underpenetrated spend. So I think it's the strategy, it's the results. We've been shipping great product, having great client wins like the ones that I mentioned. And then, Chris, do you want to pick up on some of the numbers .

Christopher Suh
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. I think Ryan covered CMS and BCS. So let me just hit on some of the questions you had around some of the regional volume numbers. So when we look at our international volume in total, which was 9% this quarter. That was largely in line with what we saw last quarter. And if you think -- which was 10% and if you think about the difference in that in Q4, we did see some idiosyncratic things that sort of help the international volume growth to be 10%.

And so when you normalize for some of those things, we see a lot of stability. As you click into each of these regions, some of these things do show up in some of the regional stories. So if I do sort of a tour around the world and give a little bit of a high-level commentary. In Europe, payments volumes are relatively consistent with Q4. We continue to execute well, and we're seeing the benefit of some of the wins that we've had there.

In CEMEA, also that was down maybe a couple of points from Q4, and that's being impacted by some of those idiosyncratic things that I talked about.

But still very strong growth. Very strong growth. Let me be very clear about that, one of our fastest-growing regions. But it was really related to the timing of promotional campaigns that we saw in Q4. And maybe the last one I'd call out is AP as well. AP is growing low single digits, a little bit slower than Q4. But that was 1 that we also called out before in terms of timing of tax payments that we saw in Asia. And so when we normalize for some of these timing differences, we're seeing relative stability across international payments volume.

Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.

Sanjay Sakhrani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

I know you talked about VAS a decent amount already, but just curious if that 28% growth this quarter can sort of sustain itself for the remainder of the year? Or do you think there's some specific factors in the quarter that drove the strength and that may not reoccur. And then just, Chris, you mentioned that there were some expenses that were higher as a result of the stronger VAS revenue growth. I'm just curious, is that a variable component? Or can that be leverageable in the future?

Christopher Suh
Chief Financial Officer

Let me try to address it. Yes. Just building on what I said earlier about the strong start to the year in VAS. Obviously, we don't guide to growth pillars, but a lot of the things that we've talked about, Q1 being 28%, that is above where we expected it to go in, but it's also in line with the momentum that we've seen. We've seen growth in the 25%, 24%, mid-20s for some period of time. It's really a reflection of -- similar to what Ryan was saying about CMS, it's a reflection of the fact that we're executing against our strategy.

We're investing behind it. We have a clear strategy and a clear addressable market that we're going after. The teams are certainly doing a really, really great job about that. Some of the things also just to tie into some of the other conversations we've been having, the first question is around events. And this year is a unique year that we do have 2 events, both FIFA World Cup and the Olympics.

We've talked about how that's going to benefit marketing services, in particular, which lands in sort of the other revenue line. That is a business where clients are super excited to engage with us and activate and have access to these sponsorships and we're excited about that. But that does also contribute to some of the revenue -- some of the expense reasoning that we talked about. And so let me talk about that real quick.

So with those 2 big events, from an expense standpoint, we see a little bit more quarterly variability this year than a normal, let's say, a typical year. When we went into the year, we said the expense associated with these 2 events will be in primarily peaking in Q2 and Q3. And so therefore, as we look at sort of Q1 and Q2, we do think half 1 expense is a little bit higher than half 2 as a result of that. But it really is associated with incremental revenue that we're capturing related to these 2 events. And so we're happy to do that. And obviously, clients are thrilled as well.

Andrew Jeffrey with William Blair.

I wanted to ask a question on the Flex Credential, which is really intriguing. And recognizing it's very small as a percent of your total credentials today, could you maybe sort of frame out growth trajectory for us. Is there a point in time when you think about Flex really bending the growth curve for Visa? And I'm just trying to dimensionalize what it can mean over the next, say, 3, 5, 7 years for your revenue growth?

Ryan McInerney
CEO & Director

It's still early in the development of Flex. I talked about some of the wins we had this quarter and others. I also talked, I think, in my prepared remarks about some of the expansion opportunities we have in the pipeline. Clients are very excited about it. We -- like if you just step back for a second, we think about the Flex Credential like the Swiss Army Knife of payments. Like it's got multiple funding options that are all packed into one card. And that resonates with different players across the ecosystem. You look at a SMCC in Japan who -- they're more of a traditional bank and they launched this product to bundle credit, debit, rewards, et cetera, all into one product.

I've mentioned on this call in the past, BNPL players like Affirm and Klarna and now, as you heard in my prepared remarks, Block who are able to take BNPL offerings that they used to have to go build out merchant by merchant by merchant around the world, which is obviously very difficult, time consuming and costly. Now they can offer their users a Visa Flex Credential and they can go use the BNPL offering anywhere where Visa is accepted, which is all over the world and kind of goes on and on.

So in terms of like the growth impact it's going to have, we're still early in the sales cycle, like you said, these numbers at this point are small in the context of our 5 billion credentials. But when you look at other things that we've done like tokenization, when you look at Visa Direct, you look at some of the other innovations that we brought to market, we follow a similar strategy and path, build great product, get it out there in the ecosystem and then go at it year after year after year to ultimately help serve our clients and grow the business.

Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.

Tien-Tsin Huang
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I wanted to ask on the issuer processing side, if that's okay. Just I heard some good wins in DPS like Block and you talked about the Pismo expansion. So it just got me to thinking, how much have you invested in both of these assets from a tech perspective, especially, it feels like there's some momentum on the processing side. And maybe can you discuss if the TAM has changed around issuer processing, I'd love to hear just an update on that. .

Ryan McInerney
CEO & Director

Tien-Tsin, no change in the TAM. It's enormous. I mean you think about the opportunity, every bank on the planet except a few needs to go through the process of modernizing their tech stack, whether that be debit issuer processing, which is where DPS is focused in the U.S. in a more narrow place. But more broadly, their whole entire issuer processing stacks in their core banking stacks.

And yes, we've been -- we've definitely been investing product and engineering resources into both. I think we've been shipping some great products in both, which is what's driving the wins, both with more traditional financial institutions and with fintechs like you referenced. And Pismo especially, our thesis when we bought Pismo was that our clients were facing big decisions on how they could modernize their tech stacks and ultimately move into the cloud. And that's what's proving out is we're having great sales interactions with financial institutions all around the world.

And when we're able to take them through the Pismo capabilities and show them that it's cloud native, provides issuer processing, core banking, it does it for all products, debit, credit, commercial, current accounts, DDAs, et cetera, we're getting a lot of uptick. Now these are long sales cycles. A bank kind of changing out its core banking infrastructure, moving from on-prem into the cloud, like these are big decisions they take time. And we knew that going into buying Pismo and we'll continue at the sales cycle, continue to ship great product on it, and we're very excited about the space.

Ramsey El-Assal with Cantor Fitzgerald.

Ramsey El-Assal

I wanted to ask about your commentary on stablecoins of $4.6 billion of settlement. It's a small number, but it's ramping seemingly quite quickly. Do you expect more growth in stablecoin flows to be related to settling consumer retail payments? Or do you see the bigger opportunity for Visa on sort of the disbursements money movement side of things? And just 1 quick point of clarification for Chris. You said there was some pressure on cross-border revenues from low FX, hedging and mix. What did you mean by mix?

Christopher Suh
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So let me just try to frame this. I think the short answer is the latter, but let me unpack that. In terms of stablecoins, the areas where we see product market fit are generally the areas around the world with significant TAMs and areas where we're actually underpenetrated today. What is that? So one is it's countries around the world where there's high currency volatility or hard to access U.S. dollars.

And we've had great success issuing Visa credentials. I think I said in my prepared remarks, I talked about this now in more than 50 markets around the world. to provide on and off-ramp for stablecoins. And that's an area where there's great product fit -- product market fit.

The second area where we see good product market fit is around cross-border, whether that's remittances at the consumer level or whether that's B2B payments or even B2C payments for disbursements, another area of opportunity, another area where we're generally underpenetrated another gigantic TAM.

And then coming back to the beginning of your question, we're seeing a lot of interest, as you noted, the numbers are still small in the big scheme of things, but the growth rates are very high of settlement on our network with stablecoins. When we have partners that settle on our network with stablecoins, they're able to get access to 7-day a week settlement, for example, because with stablecoins, we can settle on Saturdays, and we can settle on Sundays, even when correspondent banking is not generally available. And that creates more liquidity for our partners and clients, they're able to get access to settlement flows, faster.

In the case of some instances where they might otherwise have to hold collateral during a weekend. They don't have to do that. So yes, I mean, we're very excited about the opportunities. I guess just to be very clear about it, to the beginning of your question, we don't see a lot of product market fit in developed digital payment markets like the United States or like the U.K. or Europe for stablecoin payments.

As I said before, in the U.S., if a consumer wants to pay for something using a digital dollar, they have ample ways to do that today. They can pay from their checking account or their savings account, it's become quite easy to do. So we don't see a lot of product market fit for stablecoin payments and consumer payments in digitally developed markets.

Ryan McInerney
CEO & Director

Ramsey, I'm going to tackle the second part. I'm glad you asked the question about the commentary, the prepared commentary on international transaction revenue. And that's the first place I'd start, I differentiate because of the way you asked the question, you said cross -- pressure on cross-border yields. International transaction revenue does not equal one-to-one cross-border revenue, cross-border revenue lands in all of our service lines. It lands -- it contributes to the 15% growth we saw across the business, contributes to the 17% growth in data processing. And it also obviously contributes to the international transaction line.

And I will say when we look at the cross-border business in total, obviously, the volumes have remained strong and stable. This business remains high yielding and very profitable. And so it remains a very healthy business.

Now to your specific question around the commentary around the difference between international transaction revenue, I called out 3 things. I won't go through them all, but the first one and the biggest one was volatility and we talked about sort of the low currency volatility. And the second one was mix, which is the one that you've talked -- that you brought up.

So as we've talked about mix in prior quarters. And really, this is talking about the composition of yields across our business, different clients, different products, different regions have different yields. And as growth rates across these different items vary, then it can have a mix impact. This quarter, the one I'd note is Visa Direct, which continues to grow fast and also very profitable but typically has a lower yield than carded transactions. So to the extent Visa direct cross-border transactions are growing faster than carded, then that's going to mix the yield down. And so that's an example of mix.

I just have a follow-up on the Pismo update. It sounds like it's off to a really good start, and you're making a lot of progress. Ryan, can you maybe update us on how Pismo is trending in terms of wins with large versus small banks? And how much bigger do you think Pismo could be in 2 to 3 years? Because it sounds like it's a great business here, and you're making a lot of -- getting a lot of traction.

Ryan McInerney
CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Dan. Yes. As I mentioned, we remain very excited about it. The large versus small bank question, it's really both. The smaller players tend to be the fintechs. The other part of our thesis when we bought Pismo beyond what I said earlier was fintechs are limited in their capabilities that they have to drive international expansion in many markets around the world.

Often, a fintech will grow up in 1 country and then want to expand. And what they quickly run into is a challenge. They can't find a technology partner that can help them scale for the next 5, 10, 15 countries. So on the smaller fintech side of things, that's where Pismo has been a great fit, right? Because it's cloud native, we're able to move with fintechs and help them expand broadly around the world. By the way, that helps the fintech. That's great news for Pismo because it drives revenue, but it's really good news for Visa because we're able to help more fintechs scale more broadly into markets that are underserved with Visa credentials.

So it's a real win-win-win in that sense. On the more traditional financial institutions and the bigger banks, as you referred to them is, it's more about kind of engaging with clients on this journey that they're embarking on, moving from on-prem legacy technology stacks to the cloud. And that's for issuer processing, that's for core banking. And what we're finding is that when these big sophisticated, large clients really dig through the Pismo capabilities, they're extraordinarily impressed and they find what we found, which is when we found Pismo that it really is the best cloud native issuer processing and core banking stack on the planet.

I want to ask about tokens. As you said, they've grown to over 17 billion, 3x the number of cards you have. We know the authorization rates and fraud reduction benefits, which are meaningful, it's also enabling the agentic capability. My question is, how does this proliferation of token and the benefits it brings changes the conversation you have with your issuer customers and merchants and merchant acquirers. Does it further change the nature of those conversations from network fees to the value you're bringing, and I know there could also be more opportunity for pricing for value here.

Ryan McInerney
CEO & Director

Thank you. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're in the progress that we've made with token and excited about the opportunities that we have to ultimately meet our goal of 100% tokenized transactions. I want to -- before I answer your question directly, I want to go back to something I alluded to earlier. To get to the point where we are right now, with 17.5 billion tokens and 50% plus of transactions, it has been a multiyear journey. Our teams in countries around the world have had to go client by client, both the issuers and the acquirers and merchants as you asked about, get them to embed the tokenization into their tech stack, help them understand the value of it.

And do that work for many, many years, which has led us to where we are. The nature of the dialogue, both with issuers and especially with merchants and acquirers has been great. If you're a retailer, a big or small, like your #1 goal is more sales. And when we're able to show the sales uplift that tokenization provides, it's a real aha moment. The other thing that is very much on the minds that you alluded to of merchants and acquirers all around the world is fraud reduction.

And when we're able to show them the impact that tokenization can have on their fraud rates, they're very impressed. So what we're doing right now is we're just continuing that journey. We're engaging with merchants and acquirers and issuers on case studies and showing them the impact, like I described in my prepared remarks. We're really focused on merchants who have large stored credentials cards on file. And we're showing them the benefits of converting those cards on file to Visa tokens. We're focused on guest checkout.

I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the enormous progress we've made reducing guest checkout, but it's still 16% of Visa e-commerce around the world. That means 16% of the transactions, our customers aren't as delighted as they could be if those were as simple as a tap or a biometric authentication using a Visa token. So we're working with those merchants to try to put in place the Visa Token solutions to improve those user experiences. And we're also focused on new markets, bringing tokens to new markets, both with issuers and acquirers in places like Europe and CEMEA and Latin America. So we're excited about the progress, but we still have a lot of work ahead of us, and we're very focused on it.
