[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC.

Matthew Hedberg
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Great. Congrats really on the results. Really good to see, especially following the security incident last year. Francois, you spent a lot of time talking about some of the drivers, and I thought it was super helpful. The one that continues to pique my interest is AI. We're basically 3 years after the release of ChatGPT. And it seems like non-AI native enterprise customers are accelerating their AI adoption. And I guess based on the results, I'd assume that customer cohort is becoming now more AI leaning. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about this trend. And I guess, like how durable could that be? Because it feels like we could be very early in that cycle.

François Locoh-Donou
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Matt. I'll start with where you left off, which is we absolutely are very early in the cycle. But let's talk a little bit about how we've seen AI develop over the last couple of years. As you started, of course, we've seen a lot of investment from hyperscalers in CapEx and building out AI infrastructure. We've then seen enterprise, especially either AI-native enterprises or enterprise -- large enterprises that were very forward leaning in AI start by investing in training and starting to build models and train those models.

But now we're entering a different phase of the cycle where these AI leaning enterprises are now shifting from training to moving AI applications into production. So you're seeing a shift from training to inference. And with that comes new requirements. Specifically, as enterprises move to production, their data pipelines need to be hardened. They need to be able to connect their data stores to their AI models and they need to be able to do that at speed, at scale with very low latency. That requires significant performance from their traffic management solutions. So it requires low latency, high scale, high throughput, high performance, and that is perfect for F5, that's kind of the first requirement.

And then the second requirement as they move into production is security, specifically run-time security becomes really, really important. And so this quarter, what we saw were -- a little bit of an inflection around enterprise adoption and AI. We won as many new customers in AI just in the last 90 days as we had for all of FY '25. And interestingly, the mix in FY '25 was very oriented towards data delivery, basically, high-performance load balancing for these data pipelines. But this quarter, the mix was almost balanced between data delivery and security. And we saw a lot more requirements for security.

As we project forward, I think the trend is durable because the enterprises that are doing that today are kind of the largest enterprises that are very forward-leaning in AI, but we will see -- I think we'll see a lot more enterprises adopt AI in the future. And the early enterprises are doing so right now will also scale in production pretty significantly.

An example I'll give you of that is we signed a multimillion dollar deal with a global technology OEM this quarter, who have repatriated part of their data from the cloud because they're collecting more data from their customers. They know their data is more valuable. They're having a lot more telemetry from customers from their products, and they're putting all this data in large data lakes on-prem. But they then need to leverage their data in their AI applications and connecting their data to their AI applications requires significant enhancements to their infrastructure. And that is just going to scale more and more in the future. So we think the trend is durable, both in terms of data delivery and in security.

And then the last thing I'll say about security is, a lot of the security that we've seen so far when I talked about run-time security was really almost traditional security applied to AI applications. We are now in the early days of seeing AI models also go into production, there are specific threats for AI models that we now address with our AI Guardrails, and we had a very strong start to our AI Guardrail solution this quarter, really with strong adoption from some of the largest enterprises in sectors like financial services or technology or even management consulting for these AI Guardrail solutions. So we're pretty excited about the quality of customers that we are seeing in the early stage of this, and we think the trend is only going to grow from here.

And the next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays.

Timothy Long
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Maybe if I could do one on software, one on hardware. Just on the software side, I get the tough year-over-year comparison in the December quarter. But the sequential looks like it was a little worse than normal. So how do we think about that in the quarter and how we can get to mid-single digit get that business accelerating?

And then just on the hardware side, I'm just hoping you could break down your views a little bit, continues to perform very well. Market share versus market growth. It seems like we're starting to see hardware that you're selling or systems that you're selling in maybe new use cases, so maybe the market growth is dynamic is changing? Just love opinions on both of those.

Cooper Werner
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes, Tim, so this is Cooper. I'll speak to the software performance. So you're right, we did have a pretty strong compare from the Q1 period of a year ago. We had the large 8-figure renewal that we had referenced. We also had a pretty strong quarter with our perpetual software business that was tied to a couple of specific deals in the service provider space. So there's a little bit of an anomalous growth quarter a year ago. But our performance in the quarter in Q1 of '26 was right in line, is actually slightly ahead of our expectations.

And I think as we look ahead, we're pleased both in terms of the execution that we saw in Q1 and that there was no demand disruption related to new software projects. So things move forward in a pretty orderly fashion. But also as we look ahead to the renewal cohort for the rest of the year, which is pretty strong, the utilization rates that we're seeing with customers is very healthy. And we see that as a good indicator that we should have a strong finish for the remainder of the year. And so that gives us confidence that we'll be able to grow the business in the mid-single-digit range.

François Locoh-Donou
President, CEO & Director

And Tim, let's talk about the hardware, although it's -- the trends we're seeing really apply to both hardware and software. But if you step back, really, the thing that has changed in the market is that hybrid multicloud deployments, hybrid multicloud architectures for enterprises are now the new normal. And we've seen that shift happen over the last 2, 3 years, but it is accelerating now.

Now over the last 3 years, hybrid multi-cloud architectures have been driven by -- first of all, enterprises wanting to have the flexibility to deploy apps in any environment. Cost optimization, control, those have been the drivers of hybrid multicloud deployments. And we have been ideally positioned for hybrid multicloud because of the unique flexibility we provide with hardware, software and SaaS. We're absolutely unique in the world of delivery and security in being able to do all of that.

Now we are seeing now -- and these have accelerated really over the last 3 to 6 months. We're seeing 2 new catalysts that are accelerating that and driving demand ultimately for both hardware and software, but in the near term, we're seeing very strong demand for hardware. These 2 new catalysts are: Number one, regulation. Especially outside of the U.S., there is regulation that has come into force or will come into force that is forcing companies to adopt the stronger stance on resilience and a stronger stance on digital sovereignty. It means that companies need, for example, to be able to fail over from cloud back to on-premise and to have true hybrid resilience in their environment.

It means, for example, that they need to have consistent security controls across all of their infrastructure environment. Regulations like NIS2, Dora, cyber resilience regulations that have come into force in '25 and all the way through '27 will come into force are really causing reinvestment in data center and stronger resilience between data center and the cloud, and we are perfectly positioned to benefit for that, and we're seeing those tailwinds in the business. This is one of the reasons that we had a very strong quarter in Europe this quarter.

And then the second new catalyst driving also strong hardware demand is enterprise adoption of AI is accelerating. I shared that earlier, but AI is hyper hybrid and it accelerates hybrid multicloud architectures. And we are seeing that contribute meaningfully to the hardware demand that we saw this quarter.

And the next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.

Samik Chatterjee
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Francois, maybe if I can start off with similarly on the hardware side and the upgrade cycle you're seeing from your customers as well as the incremental use cases but there is that sort of end of software support, I believe, in early 2027. How much of the momentum that you're seeing on the hardware is you would tie to sort of the VIPRION and the iSeries, which are going through the upgrades versus maybe on the rest of the portfolio? And has the security incident led to any sort of BIG-IP customers coming in for those upgrades? And I have a quick follow-up after that.

François Locoh-Donou
President, CEO & Director

I think, Samik, the -- clearly, we are -- in addition to the trends I've just talked about, which are macro trends there is a trend that is specific to F5 at the moment, which is that we are in the middle of a refresh cycle with a lot of customers. You mentioned the dates, looking to refresh their infrastructure. That said, what we are -- this refresh cycle obviously is stronger than past refresh cycles because what we are seeing is not just refresh but a lot of expansion for customers.

And from all the conversations we're having with customers and the data points we're seeing, we think the refresh is stronger and has a lot of expansion because customers are also getting their infrastructure ready for AI, the deployments of AI infrastructure and getting their capacity ready for AI. We think that's a substantial driver. The others I have just talked about hybrid multicloud also accelerating this refresh cycle.

Cooper Werner
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And maybe I would add, we're continuing to see strength on -- not just from the refresh motion that has a lot of expansion but also outside of the refresh motion. We're seeing continued capacity expansion with existing customers. We're seeing, we think, some readiness for AI workloads. And then, of course, some of the data sovereignty and regulation drivers that Francois mentioned earlier.

Samik Chatterjee
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Got it. And for my follow-up, I imagine this will be a question for everyone this season -- earnings season, is sort of you did highlight the increasing memory costs and sort of what you're budgeting for it. But maybe if you can outline sort of how are you managing it through your supply chain? And 2, are there any sort of concerns around capacity or sort of supply constraints as well that you're baking into your guide just outside of price, is there a supply constraint to be thought of as well?

François Locoh-Donou
President, CEO & Director

Samik, this is an important topic of discussion. And as you know, the memory prices have gone up substantially and there are worries about supply in the industry. Now you know we went through that in 2022, effectively with the same management team as we have today. So we did learn from what we saw in the supply chain crisis of 2022. We took a lot of actions early as it relates to memory. We raised our forecast and volume request with our suppliers several months ago.

We give our suppliers extended visibility to our needs. We qualified additional suppliers to have more diversity. We started executing on broker buys. So we did early a lot of the elements of the playbook that we have to do in 2022. And I think because of all these actions that we have taken, in terms of supply, I think we feel very confident about where we are in the near term.

Of course, as you go further into the future, there is some risk around supply for us as for anybody else in the ecosystem. And we are all aware of it and trying to take as many actions as possible to prevent having some shortage of components. Today with the group of suppliers that we've put in place. What we have not seen -- we have not been seeing decommits from these suppliers but we have seen, of course, substantial price increases. And so we're monitoring that very, very closely to ensure that we can continue to have the right supply, not just in the near term, but also beyond the next couple of quarters.

And the next question comes from the line of George Notter with Wolfe Research.

George Notter
Wolfe Research, LLC

I just wanted to kind of button up the whole discussion of the security breach. I'm just curious about have you seen any evidence of your customers in turn getting breached since you first discovered the situation. I'm wondering if you guys are continuing to provide patches to your BIG-IP software code. I'm wondering if there was any disruptions in the field and sales organizations that kind of inhibited you from selling. Just how long did that whole distraction last? Any impact you can kind of tie to the December quarter results.

François Locoh-Donou
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, George. No, we have not seen any evidence of customers being breached as a result of our security incident. And of course, I should caveat and say we are not aware of any customers having reported any such incident to us. And I would say, generally, we feel that our response -- our collective response, both our customers, our partners and F5, our collective response to the security incident has been very successful.

So if I go back in time, we -- back to where we were in October, we have to mobilize very rapidly. We mobilized our development teams to ensure that we had the right releases for our customers immediately upon disclosure, so they could take actions and protect themselves. We mobilized our support teams to be ready to take thousands and thousands of support calls, which did happen but we were able to take all these calls with minimum wait times and attend to customers very quickly, so they could perform upgrades in record time.

And we mobilized our sales teams to engage and support customers quickly. Our customers were both extraordinarily patient with us and empathetic but also acted with a sense of urgency around the actions they needed to take to protect themselves. And as a result of the partnership and the work with our customers, the disruption was actually kept to a minimum. We, of course, have disruption because customers had to mobilize their resources to do their upgrades, and we were extraordinarily thankful for that but we also saw minimal disruption in demand for us.

In terms of where we are on patches, well, we provided -- of course, significant patches to a number of versions of software around October 15 and made those available to all of our customers. A lot of our customers upgraded really quickly, that has the benefit that today. If I spoke to where we were at this time a year ago, we had about 15% of our customers on our latest release. As I speak to you today, we have over 50% of our customers that are on our latest software release. And that is kind of a testament to the speed with which our customers acted but we're also really happy with where the estate is at.

We're going to remain, of course, vigilant with all of this. We have made significant enhancements to our security posture, and we are continuing to make enhancements to our overall security environment, our development environment, our product environment. So we will consider this an evergreen journey.

But so far, we are very pleased with the response from our customers and the way that they have continued to, of course, invest in F5. And frankly, we're taking this as an opportunity not just to maintain the trust that our customers have in us but to strengthen that trust they have in us. And we've had the opportunity to engage with dozens and dozens of CISOs over the last several months.

I have personally spoken to dozens and dozens of our customers. And in every single one of these conversations, they have expressed their appreciation for F5's response. And I'm immensely proud of the way that all the F5ers have rallied together with our partners and our customers on this incident.

George Notter
Wolfe Research, LLC

That's great. Just as a quick follow-up, any financial impact, revenue that you lost or costs that you incurred incrementally that you can point to in the December quarter results?

Cooper Werner
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. No, we really didn't see any noticeable impact. We've talked about -- as we went into the call in October that we hadn't yet seen any change in terms of some of the sales metrics that we track around pipeline and close rates but it was a very short period of time as we reported it. I think that something we're really happy with was just with the response that we have with customers, they were able to move pretty quickly through their remediation activities. And as a result, they were able to get back to business in a short period of time.

And so that trend really held through -- all the way through the quarter in terms of normal velocity around pipeline generation, predictable close rates. And so it just -- it was kind of a very healthy execution throughout the quarter. And importantly, also a strong pipeline build as we head into Q2.

Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James.

Simon Leopold
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

I've got 2 pretty straightforward, I hope. First one is regarding the progress in AI. You've given interesting metrics around customer numbers. I'm wondering if we could frame it in terms of revenue. In other words, what rough percentage of revenue is coming from AI projects today? And then what do you expect full year longer term as a portion of the mix? [indiscernible] you've had success raising product prices, passing through the higher costs. I'm wondering if you could maybe help us bridge what portion of your systems revenue growth could you attribute to your price hikes?

François Locoh-Donou
President, CEO & Director

Simon, I'll start with, I think the first part, and Cooper will take the second part. Look, we have not, of course, broken out AI revenues in part because we feel it's too early. We want to see more quarters behind us on AI. We have shared, I think, in the past that AI, if we isolate our answer here to use cases that we know are AI. And I say that because there's a part of our business that may well be related to AI, but it's not visible to us. And so if we isolate this for use cases that we know are a direct AI use case, we said that last year, it was kind of single-digit millions of dollars every quarter. This quarter, it was above that. It was healthily in the double-digit millions of dollars a quarter.

But we're not really prepared to go beyond that and qualify that. And in terms of the future, our view when we look at the trends over the last few quarters, our view is that it is likely to grow because we're seeing more use cases emerge, not just data delivery, which is an important and growing use case but security is also going to be a growing use case we think that runtime security in AI is going to be a multibillion-dollar market. We're just scratching the surface of the very early innings of this market. So clearly, there's a lot of growth potential. But we're going to take it one quarter at a time.

Cooper Werner
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And then in terms of the pricing increases and the impact on revenue. So the -- where we see the biggest impact is in the systems business, because those are applied to -- they're effectively all net new sales. And so we had a price increase that we introduced last January, so January of 2025. And so we're still realizing the benefit of that, that was a roughly mid-single-digit price increase. We had that factored into our outlook for the year. And so we'll continue to look to monetize that.

On the software side, there's a little bit more of a muted impact because a lot of our software sales are sold in multiyear agreements. And so it takes time for some of the pricing increases that matriculate through that business, but we are seeing a healthy pickup from the pricing on the software side as well.

Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.

Michael Ng
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I just have two. First, just on the systems revenue outlook, it's very encouraging to hear about the double-digit revenue growth for the full year. I think the guidance implies around like mid-teens system revenue growth for the full year. And if that's right, could you just maybe talk a little bit about the revenue shape throughout the rest of the year? Is there anything that you would call out that might drive a deceleration relative to the -- obviously very strong growth that we saw in the December quarter?

And then second, I wanted to ask about the EPS upgrade. You beat the midpoint in the December quarter by $0.85. The full year was raised by $0.85. And just given what sounds like a very constructive outlook for the top line for the rest of the year. Is there anything that you would call out in terms of like incremental costs that would prevent more of the top line upside flowing down to the bottom line for the full year?

Cooper Werner
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So I'll handle both. So on the revenue guide, I think you can see, if you take the midpoint of the guidance for the full year, it implies kind of a 4% to 5% growth in the second half and a little bit higher, I think it's around 7% for the first half. So to your point, it does reflect a little bit of a deceleration. I don't think there's anything that we're seeing today where we have visibility that there will be a deceleration, it's really just that it's early in the year. And so we've seen tremendous strength in the first quarter. We have a good pipeline in the second quarter. And I think what you're seeing is us take a little bit of a measured approach to how we look in the out quarters for the year but nothing specific that suggests that the business should slow down.

And so then to the EPS question, the 2 things I would point to is we have the gross margin, we took the guidance down a little bit tied to the pricing increases. So that has a little bit of an effect on the operating margin guide. And then just based on the strength that we're seeing in some of these trends that we think are pretty sustainable beyond FY '26, we're making some targeted investments that we think can really help drive a better growth outlook in FY '27 and beyond.

So we're looking at sales capacity, where we see additional opportunity that we want to get in front of with some early investments. We're making some investments in the road map, things -- we talked about XOps, so capabilities that we can bring to customers around analytics and telemetry that we think ultimately will drive a higher rate of adoption across the portfolio and then just some other features on our road map. So we think it's an opportune time for us to really invest in future growth, just given the increased outlook we've got for this current year.

Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Ryan Koontz with Needham & Company.

Ryan Koontz
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Congrats on a great quarter here. When you asked about the strength in EMEA, you mentioned sovereignty. I wonder if you could just double click on that a bit and expand on how long that dialogue has been going on? Is this relatively new phenomenon you didn't see happening so quickly? And if there was any contribution of deferred upgrades or expansions from customers that may have pushed them off, while they were going through the kind of the recovery from the breach?

François Locoh-Donou
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Ryan. Well, there's an element of both. So the dialogue around sort of hybrid multicloud deployments in Europe driven by the need for digital sovereignty, the need for more resilience has been going on for several quarters. But we did see an acceleration this quarter. If I go back to why that is, I think, first of all, this regulation have come into force. Some of them have come into force already in 2025. And organizations that are not compliant are moving quickly to be compliant before they face some penalties.

In some cases, that -- and I would say, in the majority of cases, we're seeing that translate into new project. Customers that need both some hardware and some software or Software as a Service to be able to deliver consistent security or consistent delivery across all their infrastructure environments. And there are some cases where we saw customers that perhaps should have refreshed their equipment several moons ago did not do so and were not in compliance and in the face of coming enforcement decided to refresh quickly and upgrade their equipment, and we're seeing that come to us by way of extra hardware demand.

So we're seeing both, but it is a durable trend because there is -- for 2 reasons. One is there is more regulation coming NIS 2 and Dora are already in place, but there's a Cyber Resilience Act that is coming. I think the enforcement date for that will be in 2027. And the regulation vary by countries. So I think we're going to see that deploy across multiple countries.

And then the other phenomenon is there are a number of large enterprises have expressed to us that because they don't know yet how new regulations will be applied. It's very difficult for them to forecast where they should have their data, where they should have their workloads to be in compliance with this regulation. And in the face of that uncertainty, a partner like F5 is ideal because we give them the flexibility to deploy their licenses of F5 in any environment they want today or in the future and also to deploy it with whatever form factor they may want today or in the future, whether it's hardware, software or Software as a Service. And so we are, at this time, for that uncertainty and for matters of digital sovereignty, this perfect company that has the perfect flexibility, the perfect number of models and the perfect scalability for what these large enterprises are facing. And I think that is going to continue for some time.

Operator

The next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America.

Tomer Zilberman
BofA Securities, Research Division

It's Tomer Zilberman on for Tal. Maybe going back to one of your earlier answers you talked about second half implied deceleration to around 4% to 5% growth. How do you balance that between the fact that as we approach next quarter and really the next 3 quarters? You're starting to lap much more difficult comparisons within systems as I think $180 million to $190 million kind of quarterly run rate versus maybe some of your large enterprises refreshing well ahead of that 2027 end of service?

Cooper Werner
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So just a couple of factors. It isn't anything to do with the cadence of the refresh. So we're still relatively early in that opportunity. We have not seen any kind of an acceleration in terms of decommissioning on the legacy base. So I think it's been orderly. The strength in the refresh has really been around the expansion. And that's tied to the dynamics that Francois has been outlining that customers are facing today. So I don't think that we expect that to really slowed down in the second half of the year.

Again, it's just more about where we're sitting in the cycle. It's a new calendar year. So budgets are still getting cemented with customers. There are some fluid dynamics just in the macro. And so I think we're just being a little bit pragmatic with how we approach second half. But the underlying pipeline trends that we're seeing and the momentum in the business is very strong as we entered the quarter, and that's reflected in the Q2 guide. So it's more to do with just where we sit in the calendar as we're kind of looking ahead on our guidance.

Tomer Zilberman
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. And maybe just one quick follow-up on the software side, do you see the renewal cohort equally balanced throughout the remainder of the year? Or do you think that's more clustered around the second half?

Cooper Werner
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

No, it's more balanced than it has been in prior years. We actually expect to have a pretty strong growth quarter in Q2 and the healthy growth in the second half of the year.

Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.

Meta Marshall
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. A couple of quick ones for me. Francois, you mentioned kind of a lot of strength around these hybrid implementations. Just wondering, has there been any trends that have developed between kind of virtual ADCs versus product or hardware versus the last time you kind of went through one of these cycles?

And then second question, maybe building on Ryan's question. The government business or public sector business was probably the highest concentration that's been in 3-plus years. Just wondering, was there any kind of strength within Europe on the public sector side that was concentrated?

François Locoh-Donou
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Meta. I will actually handle both. And I'll start with the -- your last question, right? Government sector was very strong. That was driven in -- by North America, in fact. And it may come as a surprise because we had, I think, the longest government shutdown in history in the quarter, over 40 days of shutdown. And of course, we had -- entering the quarter, we had the expectation of some disruption with the security incident. But we had a very strong quarter with the Fed here in the U.S. Frankly, I'm very proud of the execution of our federal team here who put their shoulders behind the wheel and despite not having as much time to interact with customers because of the shutdown. We're able to engage in the right conversations and get really interesting projects started.

Interestingly, the strength in government came from new use cases, specifically on modern applications. And also, we started to see our first AI use cases in government. So we feel very good about what we saw in the Fed this quarter and our ability to execute despite the shutdown and the continued trust that we have from our customers there.

In terms of the -- your question around do we -- have we seen a different dynamic between software and hardware in this hybrid multicloud architectures? I would say that, as you know, part of what part of the -- what's really appealing for customers of F5 is the ability we give them to choose between hardware and software and to implement their software licenses across any infrastructure environment.

Over the last -- I think you will continue to see a trend towards more customers wanting to move to software because they -- ultimately, it gives them more flexibility, and especially flexibility against the uncertainty that I talked about. But over the last couple of quarters, we have seen very strong demand for hardware. So I would say, at the moment, the dynamic is we're seeing more customers wanting to spend in hardware, in part because of some of the use cases in AI data delivery, where they really need the performance of hardware for high throughput in part because of some of the security use cases. So we're seeing that strong demand in hardware. I think over time, you will continue to see our software grow, and we feel pretty confident about our software growth for the long term.

I would add that one element that is going to fuel all of them. And we really started to see it this quarter is, in the past, our customers, if they were purchasing hardware or software from F5 versus Software as a Service, those were 2 completely different experiences. And we have talked about building our Application Delivery and Security Platform. And some of that innovation is now making its way into production for our customers. And it's fueling their desire to have converged platforms.

They all want to have simpler operating environment. And a number of the wins that we had this quarter were customers consolidating spend on F5 because they had multiple point security products or point delivery products, and they went to F5 because we were a single vendor that could deliver across all of their environments and replace multiple of their point vendors. And then on top of that, we're starting to give them a single experience from a single console.

Cooper mentioned some of the XOps innovation that we are investing in, that gives them the ability to deploy policies from a single console across multiple environments. This quarter, we took the API discovery capabilities that were in F5 Distributed Cloud, and we're making them available on BIG-IP. So we're bringing that API discovery capability to the data center on-premise. That is a massive issue for customers, no one addressed that properly today. And so the consistency that we're bringing around the security and delivery capabilities across hardware, software, across on-premise and cloud is unique. And that convergent, I think it's going to continue to fuel our growth into the hybrid multicloud environment.

Cooper Werner
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

And then, Meta, I also wanted to add on the government question. So the U.S. Fed was absolutely headliner around the strength that we're seeing. But that said, we also saw fairly strong results in EMEA as well with a number of government agencies, particularly around the same data sovereignty concerns. You can imagine those are top of mind for government entities. And so that drove a lot of strength in EMEA in addition to the strength that we're seeing in the Fed.

Operator

And our final question comes from the line of James Fish with Piper Sandler.

James Fish
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Just circling back on product refresh. What kind of capacity plus expansion are you seeing typically? And I get -- it's hard to tell exactly what your AI exposure, to Simon's earlier question, but how are you able to tell that these are capacity plus increases related to sort of traditional general environment versus sort of AI modernizations?

Cooper Werner
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So one thing that we're seeing is a lot of customers have higher security needs, which is driving a performance requirement. So we've been seeing this for the last couple of quarters, and this trend is continuing where customers are refreshing very often higher up in the portfolio. And so we're seeing a higher ASP at that time of refresh and then also additional capacities in terms of more units. So it's -- I'd say it's a combination of kind of getting in front of some of the performance needs for security as well as getting in front of the kind of downstream performance needs they're anticipating related to AI workloads. And so customers are just being a little bit more front and center in terms of their planning than we had seen in prior cycles.
