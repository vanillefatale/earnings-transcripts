[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.

Sanjay Sakhrani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Like the outlook. It's very strong. I guess when I think through some of the assumptions that are embedded in it, I know, Chris, you talked about assuming the macro is stable. But we've heard some of your competitors talk about choppiness in the economy, different spending habits, especially for consumers as they've been trading down on discretionary items. I mean have you guys seen anything like that? And sort of how does that factor into your outlook?

Christopher Suh
Chief Financial Officer

Sanjay, yes, we have great momentum exiting FY '25, and that's the underlying assumption as we go into '26 for another strong year. But let me address some of the specific points you've made about questions you had around sort of, I guess, spend and the strength of the macro economy. I mean if I just zoom out a little bit, really, one of the real strengths of our business here, Visa is the diversification of our business. And so we have the broadest exposure to credit, to debit. Our volumes are comprised of everyday spend, the special occasion spend, nondiscretionary like fuel and groceries and discretionary items like travel or holidays, goods, services, consumer, commercial and so really some of the broadest spend categories that you can imagine.

And what we do is we remain data-driven and across this broad and diverse set, the growth across our spend bands has remained quite consistent all year. And it was again, in Q4, with higher spending cardholders driving more of the growth, and that's consistent with what we see across the U.S. economy. And so that all gives us good reason over that data to say that consumer has remained resilient. That is our -- that is what we saw in FY '25, and that is our assumption going into FY '26.

James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.

James Faucette
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. Really appreciate all the work that you guys are doing on new initiatives, et cetera. One that's quite topical, obviously, is all things agentic commerce. And I know you've had some recent announcements on that topic. Can you paint a picture for us like the role that you expect Visa to play in agentic commerce transactions and ramp and kind of milestones we should expect to see in its development?

Ryan McInerney
President, CEO & Director

We see considerable opportunity in agentic commerce. But just to put it in context, when we had the first wave of digital commerce with eCommerce, we set the standards. We led the product development, and Visa was a significant beneficiary. Then you saw a second wave of commerce, which was mobile commerce. And again, Visa was the leader in terms of standards, in terms of product innovation, in terms of the capabilities enabling that to happen. And we've been a big beneficiary. You've seen that both in people buying things on their phones but also using their phones to buy things, especially with Tap to Pay.

And now in this third wave of agentic commerce, we've been leading in terms of our role of setting the standards. I think one great example of that is Visa Intelligent Commerce, where we put out a set of capabilities for AI-ready cards, leveraging tokenization, AI-powered personalization, leveraging our data token service. We put out a set of standards with payment instructions that are going to allow customers like you and I to easily set spending limits and conditions to provide clear guidance for agent transactions and also our payment signals, which are going to share those data payloads in real time with Visa, enabling us to help set transaction controls, manage disputes and Chargebacks and those types of things. So I think that's a great example of the leadership role that we're taking in agentic commerce.

And then just 2 weeks ago, we announced the Visa Trusted Agent Protocol. The Visa Trusted Agent Protocol is meant to really ensure that merchants know when an agent is coming to buy something on my behalf, it is actually a real agent that I have authorized to make purchases on my behalf. And I think what differentiates the Visa Trusted Agent Protocol is 2 things. One is it's open. It's an open set of standards, and we think that an open framework is critical to drive mass adoption in the way that's needed for agentic commerce. And the second is it's easy to integrate. We built it on existing web infrastructure so that it's going to be easy for merchants to integrate into existing messaging standards and get up and running quickly. So those would be 2 examples. We're very excited about it. We think it's a significant opportunity for Visa and for everyone involved in the ecosystem.

Jason Kupferberg, your line is open, from Wells Fargo.

Jason Kupferberg
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I actually wanted to ask a follow-up on agentic. Seems to be topic of the day. I'm just curious to get your perspective on when do you think we start seeing material volumes across the industry from agentic commerce. Obviously, there's still some important security considerations to be addressed. And would also love your perspective on to what extent you see agentic as more of a substitute for traditional e-commerce versus being additive to the TAM of the overall payments industry.

Ryan McInerney
President, CEO & Director

Jason, let me address the second part of your question first and then the first part. On the second part of your question, I think the base case is it continues to accelerate the adoption of e-commerce and mobile commerce as we all know it. I think there's an upside case on that where you could actually see users buying from a much larger and more diverse set of merchants than they do today in traditional e-commerce given the power of these agents and their ability to go out and search the world's inventory based on whatever it is that you prefer for your agent. That might be value. That might be price. That might be inventory. That might be speed of delivery and so on and so forth.

I think that could ultimately result in consumers buying more things from more merchants, which ultimately means more transactions on Visa. I also think there's a significant upside in the delivery and the relevance of our portfolio of value-added services for the entire ecosystem, especially as you said, they have to work through a number of things that involve potential fraud and disputes and chargebacks and things like that.

Right. Back to the first part of your question. Listen, it's still early days. And I think what you're likely to see in the evolution of agentic commerce is not different or dissimilar to what we saw in e-commerce. I think early on, you're seeing consumers use these agents and these platforms for discovery. They're shopping. They're looking for what might be available for any given gift I'm trying to buy or any clothing item that I might try to buy. But then I might jump to the actual merchant site to make the purchase.

Then the next step of what you're starting to see is the integration of the buy capabilities into that shopping journey. We're just starting to see that in the marketplace today. We've been working on that for many, many months with the ecosystem.

And then I think the ultimate kind of user experience and the promise of agentic commerce will be truly empowering agents to go out to search for things on our behalf and ultimately make purchases and buy things without human intervention. That, we haven't really seen in the marketplace today, but we're working very hard with the platform players to ensure that the capabilities are in place to enable that.

David Koning with Baird.

David Koning
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Great job. The data processing yield was up a lot, and I know that was explained somewhat. But I'm wondering, is some of that due to VAS, the biggest part of VAS outside of others probably in data processing? And I guess the question is, is there a sustainability to big yield growth in DP given VAS just keeps building. I guess that's the question.

Christopher Suh
Chief Financial Officer

David, I'll take this one. So yes, as you pointed out, data processing revenue, 17% versus the 10% underlying transaction growth. The factors I called out in my prepared comments was around pricing and mix. And those were the 2 biggest variables. As you know, we implemented new pricing in FY '25 in the second half of the year. That's really benefiting in Q3 and Q4, and that will benefit into Q1, as I talked about as well.

In terms of mix, now what does mix mean? Mix does -- across our business, different products and services, different clients in different regions can have different varying yields. And obviously, through the course of any quarter, we see different growth performance across any of those particular elements that will drive different yield outcomes.

So in this particular quarter, with data processing, we did see faster growth in higher-yielding cross-border regions, and that's what contributed to the acceleration that you saw in between transactions and revenue in data processing.

Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.

Darrin Peller
Wolfe Research, LLC

I just want to follow up one more time on AI and then a bigger question on the new VisaNet rollout. So first, just to be clear on AI, I mean, do you see your suite of services as a big part of what's being offered by other payments ecosystem partners? And how much are you going to participate in some of those VAS in terms of fraud versus others?

And then just I know we talked -- Ryan, you talked about VisaNet rollout, the new rollout. And just help us understand what that can mean for product development or velocity and how it positions the network for things like agentic commerce or stablecoins going forward.

Ryan McInerney
President, CEO & Director

Darrin, short answer, long answer. Short answer is yes and yes, but let me dive into both of those. On kind of agentic commerce, I think you've seen from us, really over the course of the year, is Visa doing what we do, which is when there's new technology, new platforms emerging, take a leadership role in establishing kind of the way that payments can work most efficiently and most effectively for buyers and sellers, and we're doing that in the agentic commerce space today.

And I think to the first part of your first question, yes, you should assume that we're doing the work to build the infrastructure, the operating regulations and rules, the processes to enable a lot of the things that you're seeing kind of in the marketplace today.

As I said on the earlier question, I think it was Jason, it's still very early days. You're going to see a lot of announcements. You're going to see a lot of things coming out. What ultimately is going to help kind of agentic commerce achieve its promise is collaboration, collaboration among all of these various ecosystem partners that make e-commerce and mobile commerce and all of these things work today, and you should expect us to take a leadership role that we're taking.

On the next generation of VisaNet, so this has been something we've been focused on as we continue to invest in our stack. We've deployed the next generation of VisaNet, which is our core processing platform at the base of our stack. And the answer to your second question is yes as well. It allows us to ship product more quickly. It allows us to adapt to ecosystem changes more quickly. It allows us to adapt to regional and country-specific requirements more quickly. Here, too, it's early days. We've just begun the deployment of it, but it's a very exciting milestone for us, and ultimately, we think it will be great for the ecosystem and our partners.

I noticed in Latin America, there was a slight deceleration in volume versus last quarter. Anything you can call out there?

Christopher Suh
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. Yes. In Latin America, we did see a bit of a slowdown. It still grew strong, but it was slower than we saw in Q3. And the biggest single contributor I would point to is the moderating inflation that we've seen in Argentina. But overall, across Latin America, it remains a high-growth region, and we're very pleased with the performance.

Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research.

Kenneth Suchoski
Autonomous Research US LP

Maybe just one more on agentic commerce. I was wondering if you could talk about some of the differences and similarities between Visa's Trusted Agent Protocol and Stripe's Agentic Commerce Protocol. I mean, anything you could talk about in terms of what layer is the value chain you're tackling and how your offering is differentiated versus theirs? And then maybe just talk about the broader tokenization opportunity and your leadership there with over 16 billion tokens and just how the agentic commerce ecosystem will leverage that.

Ryan McInerney
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Ken. On the second part of your question, tokenization, I think, is the critical building block that ultimately will help Agentic commerce reach its promise. And if you go back -- I know you asked about the Trusted Agent Protocol, but if you go back to the Visa Intelligent Commerce set of products and standards that we put out, tokenization as a platform is what enables the bulk of that functionality and ultimately is what's going to enable us all to have safe, secure, trusted transactions with agents on our behalf. So tokenization, critical building block of that. And as you noted, with kind of 16 billion Visa tokens embedded across the ecosystem, the technology, the standards are well known, well adopted globally in countries all around the world, both on the seller side of the ecosystem and the issuer side of the ecosystem, which is ultimately why it will help scale our standards.

As it relates to the Trusted Agent Protocol -- and I'll go back a moment to what I said to a couple of questions ago. Ultimately, what's going to make this all work is collaboration. And so I think you're seeing a lot of different players across the ecosystem, whether it's Visa or other networks or acquirers or PSPs or platforms start to put out their capabilities and standards.

And again, here, too, I think it's where the Visa Trusted Agent Protocol can form a base layer for everyone to build on and everyone to ultimately leverage. And what we're -- the reason we're excited about the Trusted Agent Protocol scaling is the 2 things I mentioned. One is it's an open standard; and two, it is designed to be inherently lightweight and easy for merchants especially to integrate to.

Bryan Keane with Citi.

Just kind of a 2 quick parter. Just thinking about holiday sales growth rate this year versus last, there's some expectation that maybe holiday sales will be a little bit weaker in terms of growth rate. Just how is Visa thinking about that? And then secondly, just cross-border growth versus e-comm versus travel, any differentiation kind of what we've seen on trend line as we go through this fiscal year?

Christopher Suh
Chief Financial Officer

Okay. I'll take both of those. In terms of upcoming holiday quarter, I've provided our guidance for Q1. It is for a strong Q1, carrying the momentum that we saw coming out of Q4 with strong and stable underlying drivers as well as benefiting from the pricing from a year ago. And so when you add that all up, it makes for a resilient consumer, a stable macro environment and the resiliency that I talked about across spend bands as well. And so we are anticipating a strong quarter going into the holiday -- our fiscal Q1, the holiday quarter that we see.

In terms of cross-border, your second question was really around sort of the mix. At the total level, we shared our numbers. It's been stable. It's been a good, strong number, 11% growth in Q3, 11% growth again in Q4. As we click down into the categories of e-commerce and travel, e-commerce has been strong, continued to be strong and steady, 13% in Q3 and 13% in Q4. Travel did improve a point from Q3 as we talked about previously as well.

So the thing that I would call out, though, is that when you add that all up, total cross-border growth continues to be above the trend that we saw pre-COVID. And part of the reason for that is that the e-commerce part of the mix of the volume is bigger. It was about 1/3 of the business pre-COVID. It's about 40% now and continue to grow at a faster clip than travel. And so should that trend continue, we'll continue to see a bigger weight toward the e-commerce side of the business. But all in all, again, if you zoom out, strong and stable cross-border trends, and we'll continue to see how they perform through the rest of the year.

Harshita Rawat with Bernstein.

Harshita Rawat
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

I want to ask about stablecoins. As the dust is settling a bit with the passage of the GENIUS Act, it increasingly appears that what was initially thought of as a risk to Visa could, in fact, be an opportunity in cross-border money movement, merchant acceptance in certain markets and services. Ryan, you talked about the momentum in stablecoin-linked cards. This quarter, Visa Direct kind of announced a new stablecoin prefunding option, a number of things you're doing here. I guess my question is what are the most tangible areas of opportunities as it relates to stablecoins in the coming years, maybe in cards, VAS, [ Niko ], et cetera?

Ryan McInerney
President, CEO & Director

Harshita, we've seen it as an opportunity for a while now. And the short answer to your question is we see opportunities in issuance, in modernizing our settlement network. I think I talked about some of the opportunities we've captured with our Pismo platform. As you said, we're leveraging stablecoins and cross-border money movement. We announced the Visa Direct prefunding work. We're minting and burning on behalf of our clients with the Visa Tokenized Asset Platform. We've been working with our clients in our consulting business with stablecoins. I mean the list goes on and on.

But just stepping back, as I've said, the areas where there's product market fit for stablecoins in the world are the areas where there's significant TAMs and largely where we're underpenetrated. And that's emerging markets and that's cross-border money movement. And we are -- we have a deep product pipeline focused on putting products to market against both of those areas of opportunity and cross-border money movement broadly, whether that's remittances or B2B or gig economy payouts or the like.

So we definitely see it as an opportunity. We have targeted a significant portion of our product road map to capture that opportunity and hope to talk to you more about some products that we're bringing to market in the future.

Andrew Schmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Andrew Schmidt
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Appreciate the Visa stack discussion. That was a good one. Maybe I could ask about the Asia Pac improvement. Chris, I know you mentioned timing in China improvement, but if we could peel back the layers there and maybe talk a little bit more about what's going on and whether that improvement is sustainable, that would be great.

Christopher Suh
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks, Andrew. As I talked about in my prepared comments, we did -- we were pleased to see the improved results, 2.5 points, and the things that I noted, improvement in Mainland China and some smaller but idiosyncratic sorts of things around timing, those will normalize its way out. All in all, we're pleased with the momentum in China and in -- across AP in general and think that, that is going to continue to be an important growth opportunity for us. And so when we zoom out from all of that, I think AP is on a directionally a good track.

Tim Chiodo with UBS.

Timothy Chiodo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Great. I want to talk a little bit about the evolution of the growth algorithm. Just looking at it numerically, it looks like the biggest change really is, a few years ago, not too long ago, value-added services was about 20% of revenue, growing in the high teens. And now it's approaching 30% of revenue and growing in the mid-20s, so the growth contribution has stepped up at least 200 basis points, if not, closer to 300 basis points.

And part of that has been we've seen the RPO tick up over the years. And even this year, the RPO has been up roughly, give or take, 30%. And I was hoping you could talk a little bit about that RPO. What's been driving that roughly 30% growth? I appreciate part of that is valuing timed incentives, but maybe dig into that and other drivers of the RPO.

Ryan McInerney
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Why don't I take the first part of the question, and then, Chris, you can take the second part of the question. Tim, I think you summarized it very well. And I think if you go back to Investor Day and you look at kind of the growth framework that we laid out and the strategies that we laid out -- by the way, both for VAS and for CMS -- and you jump forward to today, we're delivering in market those strategies, and we're delivering the results that I think we laid out in that framework that come with those strategies, and you summarized it pretty well on the VAS side of things. Do you want to talk about the...

Christopher Suh
Chief Financial Officer

Sure, sure. Tim, I think you know this. Obviously, the RPO constitutes many things, but included in that is what you've asked about previously, which is value in kind. This is an important lever for us. It -- when we are able -- it represents a form of incentive that the clients can then use to drive value for themselves, and it's good for our client engagement and continues to drive value to Visa, sometimes in value-added services but in other parts of the business.

Now it doesn't drive sort of the majority of value-added services, but it is an important lever. And I think it's an area where we'll continue to see clients really take advantage of it.

Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.

Tien-Tsin Huang
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

All right. Let's close it out. I got -- I'll ask about investments and OpEx if that's okay. Just thinking about growth and OpEx being in line with revenue, I'm curious if there's anything to share on that. Is Visa just being opportunistic with spending or perhaps it's a structural issue as you scale different layers in your service stack and some of those are less mature? Just trying to better understand incremental margins and how that might be changing.

Christopher Suh
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. Tien-Tsin, as you know, as we've said in the past, explicitly, we don't manage our company to a margin target, at least not in the classical sense, but we do focus on many things. We focus on growing volumes with our clients. We focus on driving revenue across consumer payments, VAS and CMS, and we also focus on running our business as efficiently and as effectively as we can. And part of that is balancing the investments that we make for short-, medium- and long-term return.

And when we do this well, as we have, we continue to deliver the financial performance that you've seen, which is strong growth at margins that lead the industry. So I would say in terms of where we're investing now as we talk about '26, we -- I would point you back to actually our Investor Day back in February. We laid out a pretty extensive view of the, a, the big opportunity that we're going after, the massive addressable opportunity; and two, the clear strategies, the things that we're going to go do to go capture that opportunity. And so across our industry as things continue to move as fast as they are, you've heard a lot of the conversation even today around agentic and stablecoin. We think it's important that we continue to invest in these opportunities from our position. And if we do so, we'll continue to deliver on the growth framework that we outlined at Investor Day, which means we'll deliver compelling profit growth and drive strong shareholder returns.

Ryan McInerney
President, CEO & Director

And Tien-Tsin, the only thing I would add on what Chris said is I don't ever recall being so excited about the opportunities ahead of this company. And I don't ever recall being so pleased with how well our teams have lined up our product pipeline, our go-to-market sales motions, our client teams, the things that we talked about today, whether it's agentic, stablecoins, Visa Pay, Visa Accept, tap to everything, the great momentum in the VAS business, the great momentum in Visa Direct, the great momentum and results we're seeing in Visa Commercial. It's just an extraordinarily exciting time for the company, and I'm just super proud of the investments that everybody is making across the place.

So appreciate that question. I appreciate everybody's questions. Jennifer, back to you to close.
