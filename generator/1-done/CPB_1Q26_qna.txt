[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Tom Palmer from JPMorgan.

Thomas Palmer
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Todd, welcome. I wanted to follow up on the La Romano (sic) [ La Regina ] announcement. Perhaps we could get some added detail on the reason for the acquisition and the timing and also perhaps some added details on the option on the remaining 51% such as how the purchase price would be determined?

Mick Beekhuizen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Good, Tom. And so when I look at the La Regina investment, first of all, it obviously supports our conviction around Rao's. And as we've obviously talked in the past about sauce is boss for Rao's. So partnering up with the proprietary producer of the tomato-based sauces is absolutely critical from my perspective. Rao's has had a long relationship with La Regina, as I described earlier. And since the acquisition, we've also been developing that relationship with the Romano family. This investment is really strengthening that partnership with both La Regina, but also with, as you're pointing out, the Romano family. And I'm really looking forward to bringing that relationship to the next level.

On the one hand, it's obviously secure supply, and we describe a lot of the uniqueness of the product, and we've talked about that. It's obviously a key component of Rao's and Rao's' growth, the unique ingredients, but also the process with which we're making the sauce and with which the sauce is cooked as we described earlier. So making sure that we have supply of the high-quality Rao's sauce is absolutely critical. That's what this investment helps us with. That's what this supports. It kind of supports the overall conviction around the growth story. On top of it, also the partnership with the Romano family will allow us to continue to work closely together in areas like innovation, really a kind of mutual interest in order to continue to support the growth of this amazing brand, which I personally think has a long way to go.

And if you look at -- we obviously described some of the details. We're currently acquiring 49% of La Regina for $286 million. This represents a high single-digit EBITDA multiple. And as Todd also described in his prepared remarks, we expect it to be EPS neutral in fiscal '26. I personally think this comes at an opportune time where we have integrated the Rao's acquisition, and we have continued to build this relationship -- back to your question around timing, we've continued to build this relationship. And as a result, this is a very logical, call it, like addition to building that overall conviction around the Rao's brand. I don't know, Todd, any additional thoughts around the option that we have?

Todd Cunfer
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So just to be clear on the timing. So the first payment, again, we anticipate closing sometime in the second half of this year, $146 million cash payment immediately. One year later, there will be a second payment of $140 million that gets the $286 million for the 49% ownership portion. After that first year, we do have a call option. We can purchase the remaining 51%. There will be likely a premium depending on the performance of up to 20% of premium on the second half of the piece. So the valuation approaches around $600 million ultimately if we exercise that option. And the Romano family can put -- has a put option 4 years after we close on the transaction for us to purchase the remaining. So again, about -- close to around a $600 million ultimate valuation. As Mick pointed out, high single-digit multiple. Just super excited about this opportunity. It's going to be a great partnership. It's going to improve the margins of the Rao's brand. So it's a win-win for everybody.

Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar from Barclays.

Andrew Lazar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great. Welcome, Todd. I think last quarter, Campbell spoke about its intention to stabilize the Snacks segment in the second half of the fiscal year, and it looks like that's -- you're still expecting that to be the case. I guess based on the data we can all see, it doesn't seem that, that trend's improved maybe as much sequentially in the fiscal first quarter as you might have expected. I was hoping you could go through what gives you the conviction in a back half stabilization? And how do you think this is impacted, if at all, from a key snacks player talking more about affordability going forward?

Mick Beekhuizen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thank you, Andrew. So maybe stepping back first with regard to the overall categories. And when I look at the snacks categories that we participate in, in the aggregate, the dollar consumption trend was sequentially relatively stable, i.e., it didn't deteriorate further in the third quarter -- for the third quarter in a row. So I do expect as a result that you're basically going into next quarter, you're going to continue to see that category pressure. And I don't expect that to immediately change within the next couple of months. However, as we're getting into the second half, arguably comps should become a little bit easier, and that should allow categories overall to start to stabilize.

That being said, we're obviously -- as I described also during my prepared remarks, we're focused on what we control when we clearly see that snacking is evolving, and I described it extensively in my prepared remarks, but like we are very focused on making sure that we continue to evolve our portfolio with that. When I look specifically at our portfolio performance in Q1, if you look at bakery and cookies, one of the things that actually worked well is the innovation and particularly the cookie innovation. And that really is something that we got to make sure that we keep that momentum going. If I look within salty, within chips, some benefit from timing of certain promotional activities. So I expect that we're going to continue to feel a little bit of pressure on chips, also a relatively competitive, call it, like subcategory within salty.

Within pretzels, we have great results around Snack Factory. They're really encouraging. We got to make sure that we keep that momentum going, a lot around innovation, but also in-market execution. With regard to Snyder's of Hanover, we still got some work to do. And then when I look at crackers, which is the third major category within our snacks portfolio, it's really coming back to making sure that we reignite Goldfish. Now when I look at Goldfish in Q1, as we also described, the back-to-school performance was quite good and encouraging, really also focused back on price-pack architecture. I mentioned that in the past and the importance of that during the right moments, making sure we provide the right value to the consumer, and that came through with the multipack execution during the back-to-school period.

So there's definitely some green shoots throughout. That being said, making sure that, for instance, we are getting Goldfish back to growth is absolutely critical for not only the cracker performance within our cracker category, but also more broadly within our snacks portfolio. So that's something that we are very focused on. When I look at Q1, we made some progress. We got still more work to do. As I pointed out, there are some proof points that we are going to continue to amplify throughout the year. I also think it's going to be really important to make sure that we see some of these proof points come together in Q2, and that will inform us around the second half trajectory of our Snacks business. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of context around kind of our performance.

Our next question comes from David Palmer from Evercore ISI.

David Palmer
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Just a follow-up on salty snacks. I know you won't be surprised to hear that people are really thinking about megatrends with regard to salty snacks right now. And obviously, GLP-1 usage, people are concerned that that's going to be ramping into 2026. And of course, there's that issue that some cite about COVID era overpricing, just a hangover particularly within certain income cohorts. I'm wondering if you feel like these factors are relevant more to some subcategories? I know that salty snacks right now overall is up 1% in the latest dollar sales that we see ending November 30. So it doesn't look like it's that bad of a category. So it's a little bit confusing just -- it sounds worse than it is, so to speak. But I'm wondering how you're thinking about those megatrends and how they might interact with certain subsegments and how you're perhaps thinking about that going into '26?

Mick Beekhuizen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Yes. Thanks, David. It's something that we are very focused on. And you heard me talk a little bit about this in the beginning of the prepared remarks as well. And I -- really kind of that focus on the consumer value across those different occasions or those distinct needs as we described it on one of the pages is really the way that we are approaching it. First of all, and this is a -- has been a focus since I became the CEO is really making sure that we elevate the focus on the consumer needs across the organization. You see that come through in these different megatrends that we've identified around whether it's premiumization, flavor exploration, health and wellness and cooking and comfort.

For snacking specifically, people are still snacking as you're describing. However, snacking is evolving. And we see that really taking place within those 3 key pillars that I described earlier, whether it is that elevating the experience or people want an exciting experience, which comes back to premiumization or flavor exploration or the focus on health and wellness. And our brands, our, call it, premium snacking brands really have a place to win within those different trends. We just need to make sure that when we innovate, we're very conscious of what the consumer is looking for.

So that allows us to continue to evolve our portfolio. And at the same time, from a messaging perspective, when we communicate to connect with the consumer, we need to make sure that we bring it back to these core focus areas that we know the consumer is focused on. So we're working through that and definitely some areas are working. Others, we got some more work to do. The one thing that is an overarching, call it, like important piece that I pointed out also when I talked about Goldfish is the continued focus on value. And that you see across the overall consumer spectrum, and that's something that goes for both divisions.

Our next question comes from Robert Moskow from TD Cowen.

Robert Moskow
TD Cowen, Research Division

I guess I really have two. I wanted to know, Mick, you said two things about the soup business. You said that it's important for you to raise price to cover costs, but also you recognize the importance of providing value and that there's been some share losses in eating soup. So these two things kind of clash with each other. Do you think you'll need to improve affordability of eating soups? And how have competitors responded to the price increases?

Mick Beekhuizen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Yes. So definitely something we're very conscious of, right? And by the way, Rob, maybe stepping back for a minute, if you look at our total soup portfolio, obviously, on the one hand, cooking, cooking is really working, and you really -- we're really feeling some of that pressure on the eating side. Within cooking, that's really coming back to broth on the one hand. We are seeing, by the way, that private label is recovering. And as a result, although I still expect continued, one, growth of the category, but also growth for us, I do expect that we're going to feel some of that share pressure that we've talked about in the past to start to materialize as private label continues to recover. Now from a condensed perspective, the condensed portfolio is really split in 2.

And it's interesting where you peel that back and you really see the growth on the cooking side of condensed, which is really back to a lot of the creams, for instance, that are being used in recipes as ingredients and then some of the more eating focused oriented products within our condensed portfolio, that's where you're feeling some of the pressure in general. Then when I get to RTS or ready-to-serve soups, which is a broader portfolio for us, right? That includes Chunky, it includes Homestyle. It did include in the past Well Yes!, which we've now discontinued. That's where we felt the most pressure, which is on the one hand, because of what I described earlier, a little bit of that pressure on eating soups in general. And then in combination with some of the pricing actions that we have taken that -- listen, we've taken them -- we talked about it last quarter. We've been really surgical about it.

But because of the disproportionate inflation, we did believe it was important to implement some of the pricing. Elasticities have materialized the way that we expected. We also believe that it's important for, as you're pointing out, the long-term value of our brands, although in the short term and particularly during the beginning of this quarter, it's definitely led to some pressure from a consumption as well as overall share perspective, which you saw on one of the slides. Now that being said, we're also very conscious, to bring it back to your piece around value is important and value is important when it really matters. So going into the soup season, we have taken selective incremental actions in order to make sure that we are competitive in the marketplace. And if you look at the L4 trend, you actually see that RTS is growing slightly and that share declines are much more subdued.

Robert Moskow
TD Cowen, Research Division

Okay. In the interest of time, I'll take my second question off-line.

Mick Beekhuizen
CEO, President & Director

Okay.

Our next question comes from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler.

Michael Lavery
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Just wondering if you could come back to La Regina for a minute. You mentioned the margin benefit. But I suppose at 49%, would that still come through in operations? Or would that only occur after -- if and when you have full consolidation? And then in either case, maybe could you just touch a little bit on what, if any, implications the deal has for top line momentum. It's always been a strong brand, but it's certainly -- as it gets bigger and bigger, grows a little bit more slowly. How do we think about just what you can do to keep the momentum going on the strength of the top line as well?

Mick Beekhuizen
CEO, President & Director

Maybe I'll start off with the top line and, Todd, if you can then add a little bit around the consolidation piece and the margin piece. So from an overall growth perspective, you did see that we continue to have growth this past quarter. We talked about this in the past as, call it, mid- to high single-digit growth has always been the focus going into this fiscal year. We had 4% consumption growth this past quarter. A little bit of timing of promotional activity between Q1, Q2 and it's still, I'm very comfortable that we're going to see that mid- to high single-digit growth trajectory materialize.

Todd Cunfer
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

From a P&L impact, because of the call option that we have, we will actually consolidate 100% of the P&L on -- into our business. So we will get the full gross margin impact. It will be significant for Rao's, obviously not terribly significant for the entire company, but we'll have about -- we'll have a very favorable impact on the brand. We will then back out 51% of the earnings of La Regina through a minority interest line. And then obviously, we'll have any additional interest expense coming through as we finance the purchase. As we talked about earlier, for this year, it should be a washed EPS. Over time, obviously, we believe it will be accretive.

Michael Lavery
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

And can I add a quick follow-up? If that's the case then, and you've got greater margin opportunity and flexibility, does that do anything to impact how you might think about funding A&C?

Todd Cunfer
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

It gives us -- more to come, Michael. It gives us obviously flexibility from lots of aspects to invest in the business as you intimate, innovation, channel strategy, just gives us a lot more flexibility on the brand. And so we think it's going to be a great impact for us.

Our next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS.

Peter Grom
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So Todd, I kind of had a broader question for Todd. And I guess I know it's only been a few weeks, but maybe just some initial perspectives as you step into this role, kind of where you see the biggest opportunities for improvement just as where you see them today and whether that be growth, profitability, cash flow, what kind of stands out to you?

Todd Cunfer
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Look, I took this position for a couple of reasons. One is I think the brands are just incredible, powerful, absolutely have a right to win, slightly declining today, but I'm very confident they're going to be growing in the future. And I want to be a meaningful part of that. The people here that I met through the interview process, amazing. And as I continue to meet more people through this organization, the people here are just terrific. And that's, quite frankly, when you work every day, that's 80% of the battle coming in and making sure you're working with people that you really appreciate and want to work with. Look, this is a big business. It's a complex business.

I think I can add value in streamlining analysis, making sure we focus on the right things, making sure we have the right people working on the right things, making the right investments. Having worked for 20 years for a similar-sized company, that being Hershey and then working for 2 $1 billion companies over the last 8 years, gives me, I think, a unique perspective on both larger cap food companies and then the advantages of smaller companies who are higher growth and how they think, how they act and how they're more nimble. So hopefully, I can bring some of that perspective to the company over the next several years.

Our next question comes from Jim Salera from Stephens.

James Salera
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Mick, I wanted to maybe circle back on Goldfish because it sounds like that's going to be really the key lever to reigniting the Snacks segment growth as a whole. Can you just walk us through, has Goldfish lost households? Or have you seen consumption frequency step back among existing households? And maybe if you could give us some detail on what the focus of the incremental marketing is going to be there?

Mick Beekhuizen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Yes. Sure. So you're absolutely right. Making sure that we get Goldfish right is really important. Obviously, one of our $1 billion brands across our broader portfolio and making sure that we have that growth back will help snacks, but obviously will help our broader organization. When I look at the Goldfish itself and I look at kind of these key focus areas, first of all, maybe specifically to your question, household penetration, relatively stable. It's really buy rate that we felt a little bit more of the pressure. When I think about what are you as a result, going to do about it, making sure that we provide, one, a clear message with regard and reminder of what Goldfish is and that Goldfish is here and that Goldfish -- and what Goldfish provides.

At the same time, from an innovation perspective, making sure that we give people also choices within the Goldfish portfolio. And one of the examples of that is, for instance, the Goldfish pretzel innovation that is coming out. So making sure that we provide kind of the full power of the franchise is really important in order to support that buy rate in combination with reminding people what Goldfish stands for. At the same time -- and so that comes back to innovation, brand messaging. At the same time, as I described earlier, and I described this also in the past is price-pack architecture, I think, is really important, which brings it back to making sure that we have the right value at the right moment.

And that's something that we're very focused on across not only Goldfish but the broader portfolio, but that also is really important for Goldfish itself. And a proof point of that is what you saw with the multipack growth during the back-to-school period this past quarter. And then the last thing that I'd say is, call it like the daily blocking and tackling. I referred to omnichannel execution in my prepared remarks as well. I really look at it as making sure we have really good execution in the marketplace is absolutely critical. So it's really those different components that should allow us to get back to growth with Goldfish in a brand that arguably has a right to win in the marketplace.

Our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo.

Christopher Carey
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to ask about margins. Yes, I think this is a historically low gross margin in the quarter going back some time. And so I wanted to get a sense of how the quarter from a gross margin perspective has come in relative to your own expectations? And whether you think that the rest of the year gross margin relative to current levels, whether on an absolute basis or a year-over-year basis, see some steady improvement? And I ask that in the context of, I think, this is going to be the peak inflation quarter relative to the full year guidance anyways. And there potentially is some relief through the rest of the year. So it's kind of how it came in relative to expectations and phasing from here? And then as you look at the business and you've handled this inflation cycle, just any thoughts on the prospects for margins over time?

Todd Cunfer
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Sure. Look, so obviously, incredible inflation, both from just normal inflationary input costs, labor costs plus a very large impact from tariffs in the quarter and throughout the majority of the year. So it came in exactly as we expected it would be. And as we had in our slides, over 500 basis points of total cost pressures with 200 basis points approximately of that being tariffs. And inflation throughout the entire cost system also was a similar amount to the tariffs for the quarter. And then we had incremental depreciation, higher logistics costs, a number of other items that put some additional pressure on it. Now the good news is the supply chain team is doing an incredible job and was able to offset 70% of those costs. And so kudos to them, we would be in much worse shape if not for their incredible efforts.

This inflation will remain for the vast majority of the year. We will -- there will be a similar impact in Q2 just FYI, gross margins, which was down 150 basis points in Q1, will be down a similar amount, maybe even a little bit more in Q2. Probably we'll get a little bit better as we get into Q3. And then as we begin to lap some of the tariff impacts that we started to have in Q4 and some of the cost improvement opportunities that the supply chain is working on now come to full fruition, we will -- as second half comes together, we will see improvement throughout the quarters, particularly in Q4, again, because we will be lapping some of those tariff impacts. Look, we're not happy about where the gross margins are, clearly. We know we need to get them well above 30% over time, and we have a number of cost initiatives in place to ensure that happens.
