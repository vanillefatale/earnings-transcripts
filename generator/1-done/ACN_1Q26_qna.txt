[Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.

Tien-Tsin Huang
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Julie, I appreciate your comments on scaling AI and how it's not a quick fix. So I did want to ask or maybe comment that we've noticed a bit of a shift in how people view the consulting industry's role in AI. Do you agree with this, Julie? And if so, why now? What's driving the change? And are you seeing any impact on business activity as a result of that?

Julie T. Sweet
CEO & Chairman

Thanks, Tien-Tsin. Yes, we're absolutely seeing the shift. And it's really because of what we've been saying for a while, right? Enterprise AI is fundamentally different than consumer AI. Consumer AI adoption is instant, right? In the enterprise, you can't adopt it unless you have the right security. You've done the right work around processes and most companies have fragmented and siloed processes. You have to have the right data, and most companies have mountains of data with a lot of issues in the data, and we call it, they have process debt, they have data debt. And of course, they need a modern digital core. And that's why so many companies are still early in the journey. Clients -- our clients are convinced AI is going to be a very important part of their future, and it's going to allow them to unlock brand-new value. And that's why they're coming to us because now they want to actually get there. And that's the foundational work that's driving our business.

And then when you look at our bigger deals over the last quarter, for example, you see that advanced AI is a bigger part of those deals, but you also see that it's both growth and cost because clients are not only fixated on the productivity side, you cannot cut your way to growth. And in this market, they need to find more growth. And this is where our strength really comes in, and that's why we're delivering strong quarters, right? We have great momentum this quarter because we can help them on the growth agenda and the cost agenda. And we're so critical with our ecosystem partners. We understand where the technology is and where it's going. And you saw that again this quarter with our growth, with our top 10 ecosystem partners outpacing overall and then, of course, some exciting new partnerships.

Tien-Tsin Huang
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

All right. Perfect. And sort of a related question, you mentioned the partners. I'll ask around these AI partnerships. You announced a bunch, Anthropic, OpenAI, Snowflake, et cetera. Just how might these partnerships on the AI front be different than other tech ecosystem partnerships in terms of we think about time to productivity or investments to certify personnel to scale it up, et cetera. Just your thoughts on that and how quickly might these AI partners get to the top 10 on the partner front?

Julie T. Sweet
CEO & Chairman

Well, first of all, the partnerships really demonstrate our talent advantage. So we've got decades of experience in being able to learn new technologies, skill people, who else could have hundreds of thousands of people, helping our biggest partnerships continue to grow incredibly well and be able to dedicate and commit 30,000 people here, et cetera. So I think that's a really important part of what you're seeing with us in our growth and our ability to grow into new areas is that we've got this foundation of great talent and the ability to upskill. And look, we're expanding in these partnerships because of what we see in client demand, but our clients have an ecosystem of partners. And the role that we play is to be -- we really try to be #1 with all of the partners so that we can help our clients integrate and use these new technologies with their existing ecosystem, which is absolutely critical to them. So lots of excitement. The market is expanding, and we're going to grow with that market.

And our next question today comes from -- sorry about that. And our next question today comes from Jason Kupferberg with Wells Fargo.

Jason Kupferberg
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I actually wanted to pick up where Tien-Tsin just left off. I was curious as a follow-on regarding these big partnerships in the AI world, when do they start moving the needle on revenue in your view? It's obviously critical to lay the foundation right now, but is this a next 12-month dynamic where we can start to see it showing up in the P&L perhaps? Or is it longer dated? And then I have a follow-up.

Julie T. Sweet
CEO & Chairman

Jason, what I would say is these partnerships are part of an ecosystem for our clients. And so it's I think more about the market itself, right? So our enterprise adoption is dependent on clients -- these partnerships are all about enterprise adoption. So I would focus more on how the market and enterprise adoption is going as opposed to specifically -- because we can scale as fast as needed. And that is -- our expectations there are reflected in our guidance.

Jason Kupferberg
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Understood. And then I wanted to pick up on your comments about the increased adoption of the fixed price work because I think it ties in with a trend we've been seeing in your numbers where revenue growth is outpacing headcount growth pretty materially and consistently. So do you feel like that trend is sustainable? And what's really driving that? Because we've all been talking about nonlinear revenue growth for a very long time, and it seems like Accenture is now actually starting to see it.

Angie Park
Chief Financial Officer

Jason, it's Angie. Let me take that. We're really pleased with our revenue per person this quarter, which did grow 7%, which is really primarily driven by our talent rotation. We're now hiring -- as we shared with you last quarter, we're hiring for the new skill. And so we expect that revenue per person growth to moderate over the course of the year. And that'll go up and down really based upon when we bring people in.

Julie T. Sweet
CEO & Chairman

And Jason, just to add on though, you're right though, the sort of revenue and headcount, that sort of breakage has been going on though for a long time. It really goes back all the way to the introduction of RPA. So we'd expect that to continue, but it's not tied exactly, as Angie said, to like what's happening quarter-to-quarter.

Operator

And our next question today comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.

James Faucette
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Want to follow-up on a couple of things that have been said by Tien-Tsin and Jason. First, back on AI and those bookings. I appreciate that those are -- AI is becoming integral to all of your engagements and so maybe define specific bookings, et cetera, on a go-forward basis makes sense. But how should we think about like the mix between what we could think of as proof-of-concept type engagements versus going into full production? And any color you can give on the types of projects that are moving to production, whether that be by industry or type, et cetera?

Julie T. Sweet
CEO & Chairman

Sure. Great question. So first of all, one of the things that I think is important to understand is that people have moved ahead away from just thinking about models, right? It's about models embedded in solutions, and most of the solutions involve different kinds of AI, right? So you have -- if you have classical AI or RPA that is 100% accurate, right, depending on what you're using, you really have to understand all of that. And that's what the clients are looking to us for, is to bring them more solutions, which is why our partnerships are really important, and our understanding of the industry and the function is so important. So if you're doing something in banking, which is one of the industries where there's a lot going on at advanced AI, know your customer and compliance.

The solution they're looking for, you have to understand the actual compliance, how it works across the bank. And that's really the importance -- now of you're seeing that people get that these are about solutions, it's about really understanding operations, and that's what we're bringing. If you look at sort of where things are scaling into production, customer -- so a lot of customer service, and I gave one of the examples today on the call with the Virgin Media O2, you're also seeing areas like finance and procurement. And so these are areas where you've got good technology readiness, we have a lot of depth of understanding here, and you can move relatively quickly because it's using a lot of usually pretty good data.

We see a lot of value coming and being embedded in the core value chain, the grid and utilities, right, pharma and R&D. But those are the harder areas to crack. And so it's still pretty early in terms of scaling, but that kind of gives you a flavor for it. And so any of the industries that have a lot of customer service are there. Banking has been one of the lighthouses, insurance to some extent already. But one of the things I tell my clients is that in every industry, unlike prior waves of technology, there are leaders in every industry who already had strong digital cores who are leapfrogging. It's very different than cloud where you had some industries like, say, energy lagging behind for quite some time. It's quite different this time. And that really plays to our strengths because we have that diversity of industry expertise, and our clients look to us to really bring it across the board.

James Faucette
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

That's great. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned and talked a little bit about the revenue per head and the evolution there. One of the questions that we get from investors a lot is around pricing, particularly on a like-for-like basis, and how that may be evolving and how we should think about the puts and takes there, especially as it relates to your margins and margin growth objectives.

Angie Park
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I think -- so as it relates to pricing, so just overall, I think you have to look at it in totality. And so as you think about our pricing, one of the things, and we've been seeing, and it's early, but we're seeing pricing improve in several parts of our business. And as you look, one of the things that we're super pleased about is that our contract profitability, we're starting to see some of that improved pricing show up in the P&L and we saw that this quarter. So we were really pleased with that, and it's really about balancing those components.

And our next question today comes from Bryan Keane at Citi.

Bryan Keane
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Wanted to ask about discretionary spend. We're all waiting around for a while here for that to come back. I'd just be curious to know how you're thinking about that heading into next year, conversations with clients and should we be hopeful that discretionary spend comes back in the turn of the calendar year?

Julie T. Sweet
CEO & Chairman

All right, Bryan, I'm not waiting around for it to come back, okay? So just to be clear, we have not been waiting around for it to come back. So I know you guys are, but we're delivering our results despite it because we really -- at this point, we haven't seen a change in the market. And when you look around, like we're all reading the same thing. We saw what came out in the U.S. this week on jobs. If -- there isn't some catalyst out there where we're saying that's the catalyst that's going to change confidence or change industries. And look, we work across industries. Every industry right now has got a different set of challenges with a lot of these big macro trends.

And so we're not having conversations today that would suggest that there's a big -- going to be a change in discretionary spending. But what the conversations we are having, though, is CEOs who are just like Accenture, they're very resolute that they have to deliver results despite the market. And that's why we're focused on pivoting the way they're spending. We're focused on doing the large transformational deals and then being at the center so that when we hopefully do get tailwinds, we're there to really benefit from them. But we're not seeing a catalyst. We'd love to hear it if you guys are in the external environment and our conversations haven't changed, but people are -- they're going to deliver despite that.

Bryan Keane
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Got it. Got it. And then just as a follow-up, that 60% of work being fixed price is above industry norms and you guys have been working on that forever, and that's pushed up 10 points in the last 3 years. How do we think about the -- as AI becomes a bigger piece of that, does that -- can that number get up to 70% or 80%? And just a little bit of how that pricing works with productivity, how do you pass on some savings and keep it yourselves?

Julie T. Sweet
CEO & Chairman

Yes. Well, one of the things that I think as you think about our positioning in the market is that these fixed price deals really are about our clients having confidence that we can deliver outcomes. And to do that, you've got to have our scale, our experience, our strong financials. And so we see that it is a real competitive advantage in this market where clients cannot simply experiment, they can't take a flyer. They have to know that when they're investing with a partner, they're going to deliver results. And that's why we feel the market now continue -- we're taking market share because of that. So I can't predict exactly, I mean, I think commercial models are going to continue.

We believe they're going to continue to evolve, and we've got a really strong foundation for that. And we are starting to see more focus on trying to get to outcome-based. So I think more to come in the models, but it really strength -- it speaks to the underlying strength of our business. And then with respect to pricing and passing it along to our clients, remember, this has been a business model for the industry really all the way going back to the introduction of technology and RPA, right, where we're signing contracts that depend on our use of more technology over time to provide productivity. And so that's still the commercial model of the industry right now.

And our next question today comes from Bryan Bergin at TD Cowen.

Bryan Bergin
TD Cowen, Research Division

Wanted to ask on the growth side, so just really the moving parts as you consider the fiscal '26 growth outlook from here. So you -- from the 2% to 5% after a solid 1Q at the top end, 2Q looks largely as expected, yet the Federal headwind is actually a bit less than the lower -- than the prior range. So it sounds like demand is broadly consistent. So the question is, what may have precluded a low-end raise just considering that low end raise had deterioration assumed before? Just curious, is there anything incremental there or just ongoing uncertainty and just prudent approach just given this early in the fiscal year?

Angie Park
Chief Financial Officer

Bryan, so look, as we think about -- we just had a really strong print in Q1. We had strong bookings 2 quarters in a row. We can see the backlog from our large deals. We've got a solid pipe. And so our 2% to 5% really reflects what we see going for the remainder of the fiscal year. We got 3 quarters left, and it's our best view. And we were really pleased that Federal came in a bit better than what we had anticipated which is the strength of the work that they do.

Bryan Bergin
TD Cowen, Research Division

Okay. Understood. And my follow-up is on Song. So I heard the mid-single-digit growth that sounds consistent here, which is good. I wanted to dig in, and I appreciate the detail you gave in the slides. Can you just talk about the implications for Song growth? Just looking ahead, just you consider recent advances in models like SOAR and there's a perception that enterprises can do more of this themselves or just the cost of such services will see material deflation. So how do you navigate that type of a backdrop going forward?

Julie T. Sweet
CEO & Chairman

SOAR is a great example of something we embrace and are helping our clients embrace because what SOAR does is help them accelerate production. And so it's like a really good tool, but it's just a tool, right? So what Accenture does is say, how do you use these tools to actually get productivity differently to, more importantly, create the right new products and the new experience. And that's why one of the things I was mentioning earlier was that if you look kind of at our largest deals this quarter, a big proportion of them have customer and customer service in it because clients need growth.

And the tools are just a productivity piece. They're not what you can do to -- how do you actually respond to social media sentiment in an hour, right, which is what we can do in our operations around marketing, for example. So we see Song as critical because again, can't cut your way to growth. The market's not getting better overall for our clients, and they're really turning to us to find the new ways and to help them use these tools in the meantime to get more productivity.

And our next question today comes from Darrin Peller at Wolfe Research.

Darrin Peller
Wolfe Research, LLC

Julie, what does the revenue opportunity look like at a client that has done all of the digital core work required to be effectively leveraging AI as much as you'd like to see? And then maybe just a quick follow-on would be just around managed service opportunity and what that looks like, really trying to get a sense if you have any customers that are really at that stage that you can give us examples of whether it's a net increase to revenue and the opportunities you have and different services that could help a client out that has the digital core ready.

Julie T. Sweet
CEO & Chairman

Darrin, it's a great question and what we're seeing is it's really expanding our work. So think about you've built a digital core. Now of course, just keep in mind, there's still a lot to do in the digital core because there's so much new opportunities and new ways of thinking about data, for example, than if you built your data foundation a few years ago. So there's still a fair amount of work to do even if you've got a pretty modernized digital core. But the real work, and this is why I think it's so important to understand how you adopt AI, is that you have to then change the processes, you have to upskill your talent, right?

One of the things I talk to CEOs a lot about is that if someone comes to you and says, here's how we do something today, now we're going to use AI and there isn't a big change, then they're not going to get value. And most of the work today has been around sort of isolated areas. It hasn't been across the enterprise. And so what you're seeing is we talked a little bit also about this last quarter, this inflection point where you've got now clients saying to us, okay, we have to do this across the enterprise. How do we think differently? Like how do we put marketing and sales and service together and they used to be in different functions. What does that mean then for the use of AI?

So the actual rewiring is a huge amount of work. And remember, the technology today, like it's great in some parts of the enterprise. But like if you think about manufacturing or engineering where we've had been investing for decades, it's still early in the digitization journey even for those who have a core. So we have lots of great examples, and that's why I talk about to our clients. Look, where people have already invested a lot, they're investing with us now to try to leapfrog. And that's where we are so different because we're tech, but we have the industry and the functional and the process and the change management, which is what unlocks the enterprise AI. So we really see a big opportunity over the next decade.

Darrin Peller
Wolfe Research, LLC

That's great. That's really helpful. Just very quickly, following the business optimization, what is your headcount? What should we expect from headcount or your headcount strategy for the remainder of the year now? Happy Holidays.

Julie T. Sweet
CEO & Chairman

Thanks, Darrin.

Angie Park
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Darrin. I'll take that. So as it relates to our headcount, look, we expect to -- we're doing our talent rotation, and we expect to increase our headcount throughout the year in the U.S. and in Europe. So you should see that come through for the remainder of the year.

And our next question today comes from Kevin McVeigh at UBS.

Kevin McVeigh
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Congratulations on the results. I think you had mentioned that advanced AI is 1,300 of your 9,000 clients and that implies about 14% versus the 6% revenue and 9% bookings. Should we use that in terms of a leading indicator or goalpost of what the revenue and bookings should scale? And if that's the case, any sense of that 14%, how that scales over time, just as we're thinking about the adoption rate?

Julie T. Sweet
CEO & Chairman

Yes. The way I would really just think about it, so it's not meant to be some new metric in that way. What it's really showing you is just how rapidly it's moving, 100 clients initiating a quarter and that it's at the same time, really, really early, right, when you think of our whole client base. But I wouldn't start now creating like kind of a new metric and that, it's just too early to start drawing those correlations. But I'm trying to give some insight into like kind of where is the market right now.

Kevin McVeigh
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

It's super helpful. And then just real quick, the 17.3% margin, I mean, I went back, I think that's the highest Q1 you've ever had. Is that a function of the efficiencies and again, the fixed pricing? And how should we think about the margin trajectory of the business maybe a little bit longer term to the extent you can comment on that?

Angie Park
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Kevin, we're really pleased with the 30 basis points of op margin expansion that we posted this quarter, which was in line with our expectations. And certainly, our operating margin is affected by the level of investments that we do throughout the year. So we're really pleased that we're reconfirming the 10 to 30 basis points for the full year. As it relates to EPS, I do want to make one point, really pleased with the 10% growth that we posted this quarter, strong operational results, op margin expansion as well as gains on investments.

But there's one thing that I do -- there's 2 things that I want to call out as it relates to Q2 specifically for your awareness and how we're thinking about it. First is that we expect our tax rate in Q2 to be above our full year guided range due to the tax impact of equity compensation. And then second is that we had higher gains on investments in Q2 of last year, and we don't expect the same for this year. But importantly, there's no change to our overall adjusted -- our full year guidance for adjusted op margin, tax or EPS. This is really timing.

And our final question comes from Dave Koning at Baird.

David Koning
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

The health and public services growth was sequentially, I think, up 7%, the strongest, or I think the second strongest in 12 years, so very, very good. Is a lot of that just the federal spending headwind dissipating from Q4 into Q1? Was that a lot of it? Or is it just underlying health and federal spending just getting better than normal?

Angie Park
Chief Financial Officer

David, so as it relates to our health and public service, really, we saw strength in -- we told you about federal, and we know that and that came in better than we expected. And then the second component is the strength that we're seeing in EMEA and Asia Pacific, really strong, well positioned in terms of that business for us.

Julie T. Sweet
CEO & Chairman

And keep in mind, that's where we've been investing over the last few years, including in acquisitions, and you're seeing that -- those investments pay off.

So thank you, everyone. In closing, I want to thank our shareholders for your continued trust and support. I want to thank all of the people who do this work every day, all of our reinventors around the world. I hope everyone has a very safe and happy holiday season. Thank you for joining today.
