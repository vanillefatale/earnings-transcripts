[Operator Instructions]

We'll take our first question from Koji Ikeda from Bank of America. Our following question will be from Matt Hedberg from RBC.

Koji Ikeda
BofA Securities, Research Division

My one question here is on the guide, the fourth quarter guide and specifically on subscription revenue growth. You did grow subscription revenue in the third quarter, 27%. That is pretty darn good for primarily a seat-based model. But it is a deceleration from 30% last quarter. And I do hear you on the public sector softness, I get that. And so I wanted to ask on the implied fourth quarter total revenue guide of 19%. Can you help us walk us through a little bit more on the demand environment? Any sort of Fed sector catch-up that's already happened and pipeline coverage into the fourth quarter? And any additional color on how to think about what the guide means for fourth quarter subscription revenue growth.

William Staples
CEO & Director

Thanks, Koji. Our guidance approach this quarter was fairly similar to the one we took last quarter. We developed independent roll-ups across the field, across CRO leadership teams and across the finance team. And the prudence that we called out last quarter for both the SMB weakness, and the go-to-market disruption, we're well warranted, and some of that remains into Q4. Additionally, as you called that out, we will see some lingering effects from the recent U.S. government shutdown. Guidance, at the end of the day, reflects our best view of the business today with what we know, and we feel good about the guidance heading into Q4.

Yaoxian Chew

Next question, Matt Hedberg, followed by Rob Owens from Piper Sandler.

Matthew Hedberg
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Bill, in your prepared remarks, you noted progress on the first order business was better than last quarter. But I think you said it's still not where it needs to be yet. And understanding this is probably a multi-quarter trend. Could you provide a bit more color on -- from your perspective, what's left from the team? And perhaps how long should we think to see some of the full benefits from that?

William Staples
CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Matt. As we shared last quarter, we decided to hire a global leader focused just on acquiring new business reporting to the CRO. I'm happy to share that we closed that search and hired the individual, exceptional executive that's now joined us and is onboarding, and we're beginning the hiring ramp for that team, which, again, will be a global team reporting to him directly into the CRO. We expect the hiring ramp to take a couple of quarters with results in the back half of FY '27. In addition, I'll share on the product-led growth front, Manav, our Chief Product and Marketing Officer, has now been in the seat for a quarter and has begun digging in there, looking really at 2 things with regard to product-led growth.

First, tightening the feedback loop with customers who are earlier in their journey with GitLab as well as removing friction in the customer journey to make it easier to go from a free into a paid product with GitLab. The early results there are really promising. It's exciting to see the efficiency in the funnel improving and very early results. But here again, I would expect these kinds of incremental gains to aggregate overtime, and would expect to see that show up in terms of new customer acquisition acceleration in the later half of FY '27.

Yaoxian Chew

Next question, Rob Owens from Piper Sandler, followed by Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley.

Robbie Owens
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

I was hoping you could drill down a little bit more into the Fed impact that you spoke about, Census that probably impacts the license line. Anything you can do to quantify that would be great. And then was that something that impacted your retention rate as well? Or are there other things at play in that metric ticking down a couple of points sequentially.

William Staples
CEO & Director

Rob, I think the important thing to keep in mind here is that our long-term public sector thesis remains very much intact. We are the preferred software factory to a lot of this country's leading federal agencies. PubSec is about 12% of our ARR, and we haven't quantified specifically the headwind that we saw in Q3. What I would say is that we did see disruption from both the shutdown and the ongoing effects of Dodge that are rolling through the government, and we're very much partnered with our customers and these agencies in helping them overcome these challenges.

Yaoxian Chew

Next question from Sanjit followed by Shrenik Kothari from Baird.

Sanjit Singh
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Bill, I think we can all agree that no matter what the debate is around seat-based models, there's tons of software being developed and created particularly right now. And you pointed to some of the metrics around activity and usage of the platform, which is well above the revenue growth that you guys are delivering at least for right now. And so it's kind of a longer-term question, Bill. But what is the ultimate sort of answer, solution on how to get activity in the platform to converge with the revenue growth that you would like to see. Is that -- is the answer there sort of Duo agents? Or is there anything beyond that, that we should be thinking about over the medium term?

William Staples
CEO & Director

Good question. Sanjit. Yes, I believe the medium- to long-term answer there does lie in our shift from a pure seat-based subscription business model to more of a hybrid seat plus usage-based business model as we introduced Duo agent platform. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we are on the cusp of that in the coming weeks, declaring general availability and introducing pricing. So that will help monetize the activities downstream from AI code generation by bringing AI acceleration across the software life cycle and solving that AI Paradox that we talked about in my prepared remarks.

In addition to that, we are looking at incremental innovation on top of our Premium and Ultimate SKUs, which provide customers an additive value at an incremental cost which would also be part of our FY '27 roadmap and provide new monetization opportunities as well.

Yaoxian Chew

Next question is Shrenik Kothari from Baird, followed by Raimo Lenschow from Barclays.

Zachary Schneider
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

This is Zac on for Shrenik. So one on Duo for me. You've consistently emphasized Duo's architectural importance and its mission-critical value. But how are you really tracking the monetization of Duo-specific capabilities today versus just core DevSecOps or CICD functionality? And then maybe what percentage of new ACV includes Duo or Duo-related features.

William Staples
CEO & Director

Yes. Today, in our Duo Pro and Duo Enterprise products, they're monetized with seat-based add-ons. And we haven't shared the specifics of the revenue contribution of those products, but they've been in the early stages. What we did earlier this year is shift or pivot from a use case driven innovation agenda around AI to a platform-driven agenda meaning we've augmented our core platform with AI capabilities at every layer, unlocking an agentic approach to AI, which can help customers solve any number of challenges across the software life cycle.

It allows them to choose the best-in-class AI tools like those from Amazon, Google, OpenAI and Anthropic as well as create their own agents using Duo technology to solve, again, any class of engineering problem across the software life cycle. That's been in beta now for a couple of quarters and is reaching general availability and we'll introduce usage-based pricing once we reach general availability. So the very early stages of both the innovation and introduction of that monetization stream, but it's -- the tone and the conversation with customers, as I've engaged over the last year on the topic of AI just continues to grow stronger and more excited about the platform approach that we're now taking. So I'm really excited about the future opportunity. Do see that as expanding our TAM and bringing incredible new value to customers.

Yaoxian Chew

Next question, Raimo Lenschow from Barclays, followed by Howard Ma from Guggenheim.

Raimo Lenschow
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Bill, one for you, like the SMB weakness is obviously something that impacts everyone. And it's -- you can't control that. But is there anything you could do, for example, from a SKU perspective, et cetera, to kind of help kind of play better in that market. Anything -- is it doable? Or do we just have to wait for the kind of improvement in the overall market sentiment there.

William Staples
CEO & Director

Yes. SMB is a very small share of our overall revenue and not something we optimize for from a business strategy and go-to-market perspective. However, it is -- in particular business startups and smaller companies that are on a growth path are important for us to drive awareness and early adoption on. I'd say our primary approach there has been to deliver a really great free product in the form of our open-source packages and free tier on gitlab.com, which we have seen healthy adoption of in a very, very broad community.

I do think Duo Agent platform brings new opportunities for us to convert those free customers into a first paid engagement with GitLab as we deliver AI on top of those 3 products in the coming year. Obviously, that's not been a path that we have pursued to date with the Duo Pro and Duo Enterprise add-ons. But it's something that I think we'll look seriously at as Duo Agent platform reaches GA. And I do think it plays into customers of all sizes who want to start their GitLab journey on a free DevSecOps platform, but are willing and excited to pay for AI because they understand the incredible value and the costs associated with delivering that.

Yaoxian Chew

Great. Next question, Howard Ma from Guggenheim followed by Mike Cikos from Needham.

Howard Ma
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Last quarter, you shared a stat that seat count is growing double digits year-over-year and has been accelerating. My question is, does that trend still hold? And what does seat count growth look like if you exclude Duo seats?

William Staples
CEO & Director

Howard, that was a onetime disclosure that we gave last quarter to help you think through and understand seat dynamics in the business. We're happy with the seat growth this quarter, but we won't comment on the specifics that we gave last quarter.

Yaoxian Chew

Next question, Mike Cikos form Needham followed by Kingsley Crane from Canaccord.

Michael Cikos
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

I just wanted to come back to the public sector element for a second, and I appreciate the disclosure and the headwinds from that shutdown. Can you help us parse out when we think about the 4Q guide that we have versus the 3Q results that you guys just posted, are you expecting the public sector headwind from the shutdown in Dodge to actually compound or increase in magnitude when we think about this January quarter. And again, I know we're getting to, I guess, fine tooth comb here, but just wanted to see how you guys are thinking about your assumptions here as we look at this forecast.

William Staples
CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Mike, for the question. I won't comment on the specific magnitude and whether it's larger or smaller quarter-over-quarter. What I would say is that we are seeing lingering effects from the shutdown. The U.S. federal government doesn't turn on overnight. And we are working with our customers through these deals and renewals that I've pushed from Q3 into Q4.

Yaoxian Chew

Next question Kingsley Crane, Canaccord followed by Derrick Wood from TD Cowen.

William Kingsley Crane
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

And it was nice to hear about the Duo Agent expansions even pre-GA. I know investors are eager to see the impact of Duo Agent in the market. What are some of the product proof points that are signaling GA readiness? And then just how to think more about the adoption ramp in fiscal '27?

Yaoxian Chew

Kingsley could you repeat your question, please? You've cut out on our end. Can you hear us?

William Kingsley Crane
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

Yes. Can you hear me?

Yaoxian Chew

Yes. We lost you at investors are excited and then you cut out, please repeat your question?

William Kingsley Crane
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

Sure. So investors are excited about the impact of Duo Agent in the market, the eventual impact. I just want to know more about the product proof points that you're evaluating to signal GA readiness and then how to think about the ramp in '27.

William Staples
CEO & Director

Yes. We've set a number of criteria to evaluate readiness. First and foremost, being the reliability, the performance and the overall stability of the platform and meeting our customers' expectations. We're also measuring the quality of the responsiveness and the responses of the agents that we're building and our customers' ability to build their own custom agents and get quality responses. And then finally, we obviously must ensure that we meet our own high security standards and avoid shipping vulnerabilities or exposing our customers to any kind of vulnerability.

So a number of quality-related criteria that we're measuring in addition to customer adoption and usage. And we think we're reaching the point of meeting all of that criteria as I mentioned in the coming weeks. And once we do, we'll be declaring general availability.

In terms of adoption and usage in the quarters ahead, it's hard to forecast exactly how fast that will go. I'll just repeat what I've shared previously, which is 70% of our revenue is based on self-managed customers who do require an upgrade to take advantage of Duo Agent platform. And that does take often multiple quarters to get a majority of the customer base onto a new version. So we'll see some slowness there versus a pure cloud SaaS business.

And I'll also share, I'm pretty excited about the opportunity to deliver the Duo Agent platform into the public sector since that's been a topic of conversation today, unlike many AI tools in the market today, which rely completely on cloud-hosted models Duo Agent platform delivers both cloud-hosted models, but also the ability to run a completely air-gapped environments against custom self-hosted models which many of our public sector customers have as a configuration today. So we look forward to delivering that into those environments as those customers are able to adopt.

Yaoxian Chew

Next question, Derrick Wood from TD Cowen, followed by Cyrus Motika from Wells Fargo.

James Wood
TD Cowen, Research Division

Sorry about that. Okay, can you hear me?

Yaoxian Chew

We can.

James Wood
TD Cowen, Research Division

James, can you give us the mix within the net revenue retention rate of seats versus tier upgrades versus price yield and I think last Q4, you guys had a very large seat expansion deal. Any color to provide on how to think about the impact on NRR as we anniversary this large deal in Q4 this year?

James Shen
Interim CFO & Director of Corporate Finance

Derrick, I'm happy to share the mix of DBNRR this quarter. And I also want to talk about the specific disclosure more broadly. So Q3 was similar to Q2, where seats contributed slightly over 80% of the mix. The yield was about 10% and the remaining from up-tiering. As our business evolves, this disclosure will become less relevant, both because we've evolved from a 2 SKU company into multiple SKUs, but also because we are augmenting our seat-based business with usage-based business that Bill referred to. And so we'll look to share more in the quarters to come on this topic.

Yaoxian Chew

Next question is Cyrus from Wells Fargo, followed by Jason Celino from KeyBanc.

Ryan McWilliams

Ryan McWilliams on for Cyrus. So now that you're past the price increase and you're adding more features onto your more premium plans and since you've seen competitors for their higher-end plans like Cursor and Claude Code come in at $200 a month for those plans. Do you think there's an opportunity to take price on GitLabs higher-end plans as AI becomes more integral to DevOps overall? Where do you think capturing that their usage is more likely.

William Staples
CEO & Director

Yes. Our plan is to capture through usage. I believe the right long-term approach to monetization is to have a pricing plan that is -- provides an equal exchange in value for cost. And when I see competitors doing with AI pricing is really all over the place and it's been rapidly evolving. I expect some evolution with regard to our price. But rather than introduce another seat-based price, as I shared earlier, we will be moving to a more usage-based pricing model where customers can pre-commit upfront for usage to earn the very best rates, but that commitment is a pool of usage that can be shared across all users. And as we've tested that and introduced it to customers, they're very excited about that approach. And I believe, ultimately, when customers are excited and see the value they buy more over time.

Yaoxian Chew

Next question, Jason Celino from KeyBanc followed by Steve Koenig from Macquarie.

Jason Celino
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Bill, in your prepared remarks, you talked about some interesting stats on the deployment activity we're seeing across the platform. I forget the exact percentages, but how much of this elevated activity you think is from customers of developing applications for AI like the underlying development activity? Or do you think it's for more better productivity from AI going tools? I hope you understand kind of the difference in the question, but curious what you're seeing.

William Staples
CEO & Director

Yes. It's exciting to see the downstream effects of AI and coding on the platform. And I think it's driven through a mix of things, probably both of the dynamics that you described. But ultimately, what a software team is doing is not just thinking about the code they're generating, they're thinking about the innovation they're delivering to customers. And that's really the full software life cycle that's required. Everything from planning those changes to testing them, to integrating, deploying them and making sure that they meet the security and compliance standards.

And that's what GitLab does. And because the code volumes are increasing because engineers are able to take on more projects faster, we see that acceleration in the rest of the stages of the software life cycle. To date, none of those have been AI accelerated. That's what we're doing with Duo agent platform. And once we bring that full life cycle acceleration, I believe we'll begin to see the monetization benefits that we've talked about on the call,because customers want to take advantage of those as well to accelerate not just the code generation but the entire software delivery process.

Yaoxian Chew

Next question is Steve Koenig from Macquarie followed by Miller Jump from Truist.

Steven Koenig
Macquarie Research

Great. Okay. Yes. So maybe building on the last question, Bill, I understand like the platform, the value there is holistically throughout the software development life cycle. But I'm wondering, as you begin to deploy Duo Agent platform, it's generally available, and it starts to be adopted. What -- where do you think it's going to make the most immediate impact in terms of improving productivity of the various aspects of the life cycle. And then if I could just sneak in, I I'm wondering more color on the SMB softness. Is that more of a macro or execution on your part?

William Staples
CEO & Director

Yes, I'll answer the first part on Duo and maybe, James, you can take the SMB one. So on Duo Agent platform, the important thing to understand about it versus other AI tools, is that it's really a platform approach to AI, meaning customers can take advantage of the capabilities of the platform that's now AI-native to orchestrate actions with AI tools for any class of engineering problem. So we've seen customers take advantage of it, for example, in terms of helping them plan and document what they're going to go work on, upfront, before the code even gets generated to help analyze bugs and help triage and prioritize the work that needs to be done in code.

We've also seen them take advantage of Duo Agent platform to offer and to review the code. We've seen them take advantage of Duo Agent platform to do security analysis, to do prioritization based on the advanced characteristics that we capture as part of our security scanning capabilities. We've seen they take advantage of it in terms of troubleshooting pipelines that are failing when code isn't passing the quality standard, security standards or other compliance guardrails that a company has put in place. So it's really across the board. And that's what's so exciting because having spent many decades now, in software engineering, the process of software engineering is very complex, and there's any number of ways that things can break down and what customers will be able to do with Duo Agent platform instead of waiting for a human to engage in a manual process to recover from any one of those failure classes or any of those work tasks, they can now apply an agent that can automatically work on their behalf to triage, to analyze, to debug, and to recommend a fix or even automate a fix. And we believe that's what's going to bring incredible value to our customers. James, on the SMB question?

James Shen
Interim CFO & Director of Corporate Finance

Yes, just quickly on SMB. This is segment-specific weakness that we've called out for a few quarters now. What I would say is a few things. One is we have a very strong free offering, as you heard Bill talk about. And we see price sensitivity in this segment. So both price and overall spend sensitivity. And as these customers are coming up for renewal, there is a lot of scrutiny and auditing around licensed usage. SMB is a small part of our business, it's roughly about 8% of ARR, and we're assuming that this weakness continues into Q4 in our guidance.

Yaoxian Chew

Next question from Miller Jump from Truist, followed by Mark Cash from Raymond James.

William Miller Jump
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

You all mentioned in the prepared remarks that all of your largest expansions in the quarter were with customers using some form of AI tooling. I guess, I'm wondering, are most of your customers using AI tooling at this point? Or is that indicative of a smaller subset of the group. And was there any difference in the growth drivers for those accounts between the seats, customer yield and up-tiering that you talked about for the broader business?

William Staples
CEO & Director

Yes. I think I shared last quarter, we did a customer survey where we analyzed a few different questions around customer AI tool usage, their forecast in terms of increased GitLab usage as well as seats. And we did see in that survey fairly pervasive use of AI tools along with GitLab. It's important to remember it's an and, and not an or. Many times, I've heard investors refer to some of these other AI tools as competitors. And while it's clear, there's some overlap in terms of what we're doing and what they're doing. Ultimately, customers see them as complementary because they serve a variety of different use cases and support one another.

So yes, I believe AI tool usage is pervasive across our customer base. Many of them implementing multiple AI tools as part of their current AI strategy. And I believe we're in a good position with Duo Agent platform to capture our fair share of that demand because we're solving inherently different problems than other AI tools on the market.

Yaoxian Chew

Final question will come from Mark Cash at Raymond James, and I will pass it over to Bill for closing remarks.

Mark Cash

Bill, maybe building on that last question. So we've seen some larger players like OpenAI and Google add more DevSecOps functionality alongside the smaller AI natives this quarter. Just curious how you're considering deploying that $1.2 billion of cash and really strong free cash flow we're seeing, maybe help further wedge GitLab's differentiation that spans this software development life cycle against those guys.

William Staples
CEO & Director

Yes. There's mainly 2 parts to that question. How do I think about what -- how GitLab competes with small and large vendors. And then there's deployment of capital. Maybe, James, you can take the second part. I'll take the first part. Really, when you think about what agents are made of, there's really 4 ingredients to every agent. There's an LLM and we provide like almost every vendor access to all of the major foundational LLMs in the market. And the cost of those is going to continue to go down. The quality of those is going to continue to go up. Not a lot of differentiation to be had there. It's just like electricity for any kind of electronic system.

Second part of an agent is the prompt that steers the LLM into solving the problem. And that's defined with human language. And again, here, the IP value is fairly shallow. There are many, many libraries of open-source prompts that and available. There's only so many ways you can tell an LLM to solve the problem. And we provide Duo Agents with great prompts out of the box. But we also allow customers to customize and extend those prompts. So a little level of extensibility beyond what competitors offer today.

But those 2 ingredients, I would say largely our commodity. And it's really the second 2 ingredients that make GitLab stand out and that even the large AI vendors can't match. The first is context. We provide not only the system of record for all of the source code that our customer store, but all of the changes to that source code over time, all of the testing and quality validation of that source code, the security of that source code, all of the related plans and bug tracking and everything else.

That context all goes into feeding agents the ability to reason and make good decisions. And virtually no other competitor has the breadth of context that we have as part of our unified platform approach, and we believe that's a durable differentiator over time. The fourth ingredient that agents have or made up of is tools to actually action on behalf of users various actions. And here, again, our unified platform really comes out as a strength because anyone can generate code. It basically involves generating streams that get written into text files, right? But when it comes to full life cycle software engineering, you're talking about much more sophisticated operations everything from planning and testing and securing and integrating and deploying code that requires a rich set of capabilities that have to be integrated one with another.

And we've delivered that to humans for now more than a decade, but with Duo Agent platform, we're unlocking all of those rich capabilities for agents as well. So agents can take those actions. And that's the really exciting differentiator and value that we provide our customers that I really don't think either small or large AI competitors to match.

James Shen
Interim CFO & Director of Corporate Finance

And then on the cash position, the $1.2 billion of cash and investments really puts us in a position of strength in this market. And we have a strong track record of fiscal discipline here, and we're constantly looking at the most optimal avenues for our capital allocation that best deliver value, both to our customers, and to our shareholders.

Yaoxian Chew

Great. With that, that concludes our Q&A. I would like now to turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks. Bill, go ahead, please.

William Staples
CEO & Director

Thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. 1 year into my journey with GitLab, and I believe we're executing stronger than ever with a blueprint towards scaled responsible growth. As we shared, we're expanding our sales capacity in our field and investing behind dedicated first order team in order to take advantage of our growing TAM. Product innovation and differentiation are also accelerating, and we're earning our right to define the future of software development with AI. We're now in the cusp of declaring general availability for our agentic AI platform, which will evolve our business model from a purely seat-based model to a hybrid seat plus usage-based model as we create new pathways to deliver value for our customers. These are all really significant structural improvements to GitLab. One thing that isn't changing, we remain committed to investing and building for responsible growth to drive shareholder value.

I'll close the call where I started off. There has never been a more exciting time to be at GitLab. And James and I are in Phoenix, Arizona this week, and we'll be speaking at the UBS Global Technology and AI Conference. We hope to see you there or elsewhere during the quarter. Thank you again, and good night.
