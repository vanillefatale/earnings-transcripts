Lane Riggs
CEO, President & Chairman

Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by highlighting some of our team's accomplishments in 2025. Last year was our best year for personnel safety and environmental performance, building on personnel and process safety records we set in 2024. Our continued commitment to safe, reliable and environmentally responsible operations resulted in record refining throughput and record ethanol production for both the fourth quarter and the full year. We also set a record for mechanical availability in 2025. These accomplishments reflect the hard work, expertise and dedication of our entire team.

We delivered strong financial results in the fourth quarter, reinforcing our consistent track record of operational and commercial excellence. We captured favorable refining margins during the quarter driven by strong product cracks and widening sour crude discounts and our fourth quarter performance capped off excellent financial results for the year.

Strategically, we continue to make progress on our SEC unit optimization project at our St. Charles refinery. This $230 million initiative will enhance our ability to produce high-value product yields, including alkylate. We still expect the project to begin operations in the second half of 2026.

Looking ahead, we believe refining fundamentals should remain supported by continued demand growth and tight supply environment driven by limited capacity additions. Sour crude differentials are also expected to benefit from increased Canadian crude production, along with additional Venezuelan crude supply into the U.S.

In closing, Valero's strong financial results and record operating performance, highlight our operational and commercial excellence. We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation framework that prioritizes balance sheet strength, disciplined capital investments and shareholder returns.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Homer.

Homer Bhullar
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Lane. For the fourth quarter of 2025, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $1.1 billion or $3.73 per share compared to $281 million or $0.88 per share for the fourth quarter of 2024. Excluding the adjustments shown in the earnings release tables, adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $1.2 billion or $3.82 per share for the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to $207 million or $0.64 per share for the fourth quarter of 2024.

For 2025, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $2.3 billion or $7.57 per share compared to $2.8 billion or $8.58 per share in 2024. 2025 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $3.3 billion or $10.61 per share compared to $2.7 billion or $8.48 per share in 2024. The refining segment reported $1.7 billion of operating income for the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to $437 million for the fourth quarter of 2024. Adjusted operating income was $1.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to $441 million for the fourth quarter of 2024.

Refining throughput volumes in the fourth quarter of 2025 averaged 3.1 million barrels per day or 98% throughput capacity utilization. And as Lane highlighted earlier, we achieved record throughput for both the quarter and the full year. Refining cash operating expenses were $5.03 per barrel in the fourth quarter 2025. The renewable diesel segment reported operating income of $92 million for the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to $170 million for the fourth quarter of 2024.

Renewable Diesel segment sales volumes averaged 3.1 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2025. The ethanol segment reported $117 million of operating income for the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to $20 million for the fourth quarter of 2024. Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.8 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2025, also setting a quarterly and full year record.

G&A expenses were $315 million for the fourth quarter of 2025 and $1 billion for the full year. Depreciation and amortization expense was $817 million for the fourth quarter of 2025, which includes approximately $100 million of incremental depreciation expense related to our plan to cease refining operations at our Benicia refinery.

Net interest expense was $139 million and income tax expense was $355 million for the fourth quarter of 2025. The effective tax rate was 25% for 2025. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2025. Included in this amount was a $349 million unfavorable impact from working capital and $269 million of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities associated with the other joint venture member share of DGD. Excluding these items, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2025.

Net cash provided by operating activities in 2025 was $5.8 billion, included in this amount was $192 million unfavorable change in working capital and $30 million of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities associated with the other joint venture member share of DGD. Excluding these items, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $6 billion in 2025.

Regarding investing activities, we made $412 million of capital investments in the fourth quarter of 2025, of which $368 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance and the balance was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to the other joint venture member share of DGD and other variable interest entities, capital investments attributable to Valero were $405 million in the fourth quarter of 2025 and $1.8 billion for the year.

Moving to financing activities. We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation framework. Shareholder cash returns totaled $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2025 resulting in a payout ratio of 66% for the quarter. For the full year, shareholder cash returns totaled $4 billion, resulting in a payout ratio of 67% for the year. We ended the year with 299 million shares outstanding, reflecting a reduction of 5% for the year and 42% since 2014.

Earlier this month, our Board approved a 6% increase to the quarterly cash dividend slightly higher than last year, reflecting a strong financial position and our commitment to a growing dividend.

With respect to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $8.3 billion of total debt, $2.4 billion of total finance lease obligations and $4.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents. The debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents was 18% as of December 31, 2025, and we ended the quarter well capitalized with $5.3 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash.

Turning to guidance. We expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2026 to be approximately $1.7 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts, regulatory compliance and joint venture investments. About $1.4 billion of that is allocated to sustaining the business and the balance to growth projects. These growth projects are focused primarily on shorter cycle optimization investments that enhance crude and product optionality across our refining system as well as efficiency and rate expansion projects within our ethanol plants.

Collectively, these projects should strengthen the earnings capacity of our existing asset base.

For modeling our first quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.695 million to 1.745 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 430,000 to 450,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 160,000 to 180,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 485,000 to 505,000 barrels per day.

We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $5.17 per barrel. For the Renewable Diesel segment, we expect sales volumes of approximately 260 million gallons in the first quarter. Operating expenses should be $0.72 per gallon, including $0.35 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization.

Our Ethanol segment is expected to produce 4.6 million gallons per day in the first quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.49 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization.

For the first quarter, net interest expense should be about $140 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter should be approximately $835 million, which includes approximately $100 million of incremental depreciation expense related to our plan to cease refining operations at our Benicia refinery. We expect incremental depreciation related to the Benicia refinery to be included in D&A for the first quarter and in April.

First quarter earnings impact is approximately $0.25 per share based on current shares outstanding. For 2026, we expect G&A expenses to be approximately $960 million. Lastly, our capital allocation framework remains unchanged with a commitment to a through-cycle minimum annual payout ratio of 40% to 50% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities, and our long-term target net debt-to-cap ratio remains 20% to 30% with a minimum cash balance between $4 billion to $5 billion, with all excess free cash flow going towards shareholder returns.

CEO, President & Chairman
