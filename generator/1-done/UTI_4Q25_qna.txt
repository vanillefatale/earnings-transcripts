Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from [ Josh Bebe ] with Truist.

Jasper Bibb
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Yes. It's Jasper Bibb with Truist. Just hoping you could give a little bit more detail on what you're expecting for start growth in '26 between the UTI and Concorde segments. Should we expect the start growth to be relatively even between the 2 segments? Or maybe is there a differential there?

Bruce Schuman
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Jasper, it's Bruce. Yes, we're like we said on the call, we're expecting roughly about an 8% -- 8% to 9% starts growth for '26. It's going to be very similar in kind of profile to this year, and we're investing to make sure we can make that happen and feel good about the growth for starts in '26. And that's going to be a very similar segment profile to follow up on your question, too, as we saw in '25. It's going to be a very similar profile per segment.

Jasper Bibb
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. No, that makes sense. And then I just wanted to clarify something from the press release. Was this comment about as much as 5 campus openings annually. But between the 2 divisions or on a combined basis, I guess my question is, I don't think there will be a scenario where you do like 10 campus openings in a year, but I just wanted to make sure I understand the point.

Bruce Schuman
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Just to clarify, it means between the two divisions. We have previously said that we would likely open 2 to 3, and now it will be somewhere between 2 and 5 per year.

Jasper Bibb
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Understood. Last one for me. You mentioned the cash impact of the Department of Ed's ID verification measures, which makes sense. Just hoping you could comment on if you've seen any productivity impact on the front end, bringing on new students. Is that taking longer? Is there additional processes they're making you go through as part of that program?

Bruce Schuman
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Jasper. No, we've seen no impact at all on the front end. This was simply a temporarily -- as the department kind of increased their focus on verifications, legal status, that type of thing, just basically getting through that backlog of verifications caused a little bit of a slowdown in cash collection, but it was temporary. Frankly, we're already seeing it kind of come back to normal here as we start the quarter. So we don't think it's going to be a long-term drag or anything like that on free cash flow.

The next question is from Mike Grondahl with Northland Securities.

Mike Grondahl
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

Congrats on a nice quarter. Could you talk a little bit about how your high school recruiting efforts went kind of compared to your expectations?

Jerome Grant
CEO & Director

Sure. Mike, I've talked a lot. I always want them to go better. I think they went about where we expected them to. We didn't add high school resources this last year. We will for 2026. We chose to put sort of the additional strategic investment in Concorde. We saw an opportunity to significantly ramp the Concorde enrollment, specifically around the higher-value clinical courses this year. And so as we are balancing additional strategic investment rather than adding resources in the high school for UTI, we put more money into Concorde. Also, with the program launches that we've got at UTI, which are highly concentrated in the skilled trades, we're seeing that the skilled trades tend to appeal more to the adult population.

And so tilt a little more investment in marketing to the adult population this year as well. Now as we're opening new campuses, Atlanta, San Antonio and move forward, there'll be more of a balance between high school and adult. And so that's why we're adding more resources into the high school channel for 2026.

Mike Grondahl
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

Got it. Got it. And then can you talk a little bit about tuition increases kind of embedded in your 2026? And how are you thinking about pricing power? With demand as strong as it is, what's kind of your current thinking there?

Jerome Grant
CEO & Director

Well, number one, we assume somewhere between a 2% and a 3% price increase. It varies by program and by market in some instances, but our numbers assume somewhere between 2% and 3%. And when you think about pricing, when inflation spiked in 2022 and 2023, people were saying, why don't you take a 10% price increase. And the way you have to look at it is really around student funding. There wasn't a significant increase in PEL grants and student loan qualifications at that time frame, which means every dollar above that 2% or 3% that we have, it really adds to the gap that the student has to pay out of their own pocket. right?

So there is an unlimited upside pricing power to be able to do that. Should there be significant increases in student funding, we might be able to see a little bit more in pricing. And in some areas where the demand is high and we may be seeing really stiff demand, we may see a little more. But on average, it's going to average between 2% and 3%.

Mike Grondahl
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

Got it. And then maybe lastly, how will you, I don't know, choose between at least 2 and up to 5? Are you -- help us think through the low end and the high end of that range.

Jerome Grant
CEO & Director

Yes. I mean the low end is conservative. One of the things we already said was you can pretty much count on us for launching 2 UTI campuses a year. And that was prior to Concorde's growth restrictions falling by the wayside and us getting into the game with them as well. So we hold open the opportunity in the years to come that we could slow it down a little bit. But right now, the opportunity is so great. I mean the demand is so high for what we're doing in many geographies around the country that we've announced our first 3 campuses for 2027. We had hoped to be able to get a Concorde campus or 2 open in '26, but due to a creditor approval, real estate and building and things like that. It likely won't be until '27. We announced 2 of those. We've announced the first campus for 2027 for UTI in Salt Lake City. And frankly, we're working on more. So we want to make sure that we're moving both prudently but aggressively to solve this problem out there.

[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Griffin Boss with B. Riley.

Griffin Boss
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

So I'll just start off for Bruce near the end of your prepared remarks, you talked about expectations for marginal growth in adjusted EBITDA starting in 2027. Can you just clarify here for me, is that implying marginal growth over 2026 numbers or marginal growth over what you did in '25?

Bruce Schuman
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Griffin. Yes, to be clear, that's marginal growth then over '26 numbers. We've always said '26, '27 are really our investment years, you're going to kind of see this dip, which you're seeing here in our '26 guide. We're not giving a specific '27 guide, obviously, but you'll start to see some marginal EBITDA growth in '27 and then it will really take off in '28, '29. That's when you'll start to see the return from these new campuses and investments really pay off and add to the bottom line.

Griffin Boss
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

Understood. Yes. That's what I thought. I just wanted to make sure I had it correct. And then just shifting to the CapEx cadence going forward. Bruce, you also talked about that. I missed specifically what you said, but I did want to just discuss what happened in '25. Obviously, that came -- you talked about free cash flow and CapEx came in below what you had expected as well. Is that -- is the gap there, the delta, is that also just because of the Department of Ed and the cash collections coming in, you kind of tempered your CapEx spend this year? And then along those same lines, should we expect 2026 CapEx to be that much greater? It was about, what, $13?

Bruce Schuman
Executive VP & CFO

On an accrued basis, it was actually closer to $54 million, almost right on our guide. Cash, we didn't quite hit it. It was about $42 million on a cash basis. So really, it was -- it's a timing issue. It's accruals, and we're seeing that just -- it really happened towards the end of the year as we really pushed our teams to get that CapEx spend and stay on schedule.

Griffin Boss
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Okay. Got it. Understood. And then last one for me, just on the 3 new campuses that you guys announced yesterday, that's -- the growth is great to see. Is there anything -- can you just remind us maybe or tell us kind of how you look at revenue potential of these different campuses once they've scaled? You've talked in the past about UTI's Atlanta campus, maybe I think, if I remember correctly, $45 million revenue contribution when it's scaled and then San Antonio for UTI is $23 million. So is there anything you can just talk about across these Concorde campuses and UTI, Salt Lake expectations when you reach these scaled student numbers you talked about?

Jerome Grant
CEO & Director

So first of all, from Salt Lake, it's Jerome here Griffin. Thanks for the question. Salt Lake City is going to -- we think it's going to behave a lot like Atlanta. It's a full comprehensive campus, transportation, skilled trades and energy aviation on that campus. So we think you're talking about 1,200, 1,300 students in the $40 million to $45 million range at peak. That's our current version of the optimized campus. And again, we're never satisfied with this notion of optimization. We'll keep looking for more, whether it's new programs or new ways to teach. So Salt Lake City is going to behave a lot like Atlanta.

Now these are the first Concorde campuses that are coming to market. And generally speaking, what we're looking at Concorde is a full line of the Concorde offerings on each of the campus, which tends to come somewhere in the neighborhood of 600, 700 students, slightly less revenue per student. And so you're looking at about $20 million to $25 million in revenue. And again, we'll continue to look at our program offerings there and see what we can fit in beyond that. But we don't have a variable model in terms of Concorde that we're putting out because the demand in the health care space and in the dental space is just so high everywhere that it's hard to find a market where you would look at it and say, I'm not going to put dental in there or I'm not going to put radiology tech in or some of the clinical courses is that we're going to market with full comprehensive health care programs in all of ours.

And like I said, we wanted to get the news out that we've signed our leases in Salt Lake City and Houston and Atlanta for Concorde, and we're continuing to work on more locations, whether at the end of '27 or into '28, we're working on those right now.

Bruce Schuman
Executive VP & CFO

And then Griffin, just to add one thing to underscore what Jerome said. You are exactly right. That full campus in Salt Lake City, those are typically $40 million to $45 million revenue campuses. IRR is north of 30%, return on invested capital north of 30%. So I just wanted to answer that question. You are correct in the revenue expectations.

Operator

The next question is from Raj Sharma with Texas Capital.

Raj Sharma

I wanted to ask you about the start that you -- the starts projected for '26. I think that you've already addressed a part of it. You said the starts growth will be equivalent in UTI and Concorde. Any sort of breakdown amongst young adults, high school or military veteran that you see that you're contemplating for fiscal '26? And then -- how much of the starts is going to be new campuses and programs? I'm getting -- trying to get a sense of what your same-store starts growth is for '26.

Jerome Grant
CEO & Director

Yes. Well, there's a couple of dynamics at play is as we continue to diversify the UTI campuses to be a full line of transportation, skilled trades and energy, the student population tends to be getting a little older, right? And that doesn't mean that we're not going to add resources in the high schools. We absolutely are because we're opening new campuses, we need people in new locations. We need to intensify our efforts in places like as we open in Atlanta and San Antonio and as we get ready for Salt Lake City. So we will be adding resources in the high school.

But the skilled trades tend to appeal to an older audience. kids in high school tend to know about fixing cars. They don't know about wind energy. They don't tend to know about HVAC and welding and the like. And so they tend to really gravitate towards the transportation areas, whereas people who have been out in the world for a couple of years, 19, 20, 21, 22-year-olds, often gravitate towards the skilled trades, which is balancing out the population now on the UTI campus. The other factor that's at play or the other aspects that are at play is that the skilled trades also tend to attract people who are more local and give us more opportunity to dig deeper into the local markets. And as we've said over the past, the local student tends to start faster, tends to make a decision faster and tends to get going, whereas someone who has to relocate has to find somewhere to live and there's a longer time line.

And so what we're seeing is shorter time lines from contract to start, and we're seeing higher show rates out of the local population. So we're -- these are all things that are helping both our revenue and our margin improve.

Raj Sharma

Got it. Also, I wanted to get a sense of what the employment trends across programs. Have you seen any sort of a slowdown or -- and even geographically speaking, are you seeing a consistent employment at graduation mark that you have seen in the past? Or has that changed or?

Jerome Grant
CEO & Director

Yes. If anything, it's intensifying. I mean we're continuing to get more B2B inquiries around government contracts that have been signed around airplane building, shipbuilding, data centers. Our industrial maintenance technology courses are doing quite well because of the number of areas that are being built in there. So if anything, we're seeing the demand intensify. On the transportation side, I mean, you heard the CEO of Ford just this last week, he's got 5,000 openings he can't fill, right? He's offering upwards of $120,000 to try to get these folks. And so there's no slowing down in the transportation business at all.

Raj Sharma

Fantastic. And then just on -- just a hypothetical question. There's been a talk in the Department of Education totally getting disbanded dismantled. Any sort of impact on you on the approvals on FASA that you foresee? Or do you think that it would just be give it out to the different divisions, different departments of the government?

Jerome Grant
CEO & Director

Yes, I think with -- great question. Thanks for asking. I know that news came out yesterday, obviously. And this is something that, frankly, this administration who's been dramatically more collaborative with us over the tenure in office has been foreshadowing since they took over. And to put a point on your question is there really are 2, in a sense, pieces of the Department of Education that are most relevant to us, one being the entity or frankly, the bank that administers Title IV funding. That's something that's perpetually funded. It's self-contained.It wasn't part of the announcement yesterday.

What we've seen is FASPAs are now moving quite well. There isn't -- all the glitches they had with the new electronic FASPA, et cetera, seem to behind them, and we're seeing that progress quite well. If that were to be picked up as a chunk and moved over to another department within the government, we don't anticipate that we would see any real disruption along those lines. And then the other entity is really what you started with was the entity of approvals. And that was announced that the intention was to pick that up and move it over under the Department of Labor. Same group of people, same leadership, et cetera, but under the auspice of the Department of Labor. What I can tell you now is that our approval process is far more streamlined, much less friction and much more collaborative than it has ever been since I've been with this company for the last 8 years.

The agreements are moving quite rapidly. I'm signing new PPA agreements 5 in the last week that as we think about renewals and new campuses and new programs, et cetera. And so we're quite pleased with the collaboration we're seeing from Washington and the lines of communications we've even started to open with the Department of Labor around how we might be able to solve these huge labor problems in the U.S. So, so far, the 2 entities we see are working out quite well.

This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jerome Grant for any closing remarks.

Jerome Grant
CEO & Director

Thank you, operator. Really appreciate it. I'd like to thank everyone who attended today. Big day in the market for people reporting. So we like that you prioritized us. As always, Bruce, Matt and I are available to follow up with any questions. We encourage once again, as we always have, people to visit our campuses. You really got to see what we're doing, especially the new ones that we'll be opening in Atlanta, San Antonio and the Concorde Heartland campus down in Florida. If you're interested, please give us a call. So we look forward to speaking with you again when we report our first fiscal quarter of '26, which will be sometime in February. Until then, I'd like to wish you all a very happy holiday season. Thank you.
