Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen.

Oliver Chen
TD Cowen, Research Division

Regarding direct-to-consumer comp sales, the momentum and solid numbers you're seeing there, what initiatives are you prioritizing to sustain the momentum here? And how close are you to the longer-term opportunity of $4,000-plus sales per square foot and thoughts there?

Carrie Baker
President of Brand & Commercial

Oliver, thanks. It's Carrie here. We're really excited about our DT comp sales. I think that has been such a big effort over the last 18 months, and you've seen us quarter after quarter start to deliver on that. There's a few things. It's not just one or the other. It's the combination of we've better trained our staff. We've hired earlier and so that they're ready for peak. They're starting to deliver that. So sharper channel execution.

There's also a product piece, which is really exciting. So we -- as you heard Dani talk about, we've delivered so much more newness, 40% of newness now being DTC revenue. And that's both seasonal relevance. So there's better product for Q2 so that people are choosing something they're wearing it right now, but then also the inventory availability. So we've done a lot of work of making sure that the stores and online, they're ready for peak, they're ready for people to come in when we're marketing it.

So the third piece is the marketing. Really, it's been such a boom to the traffic, the engagement, the excitement that we're seeing from consumers. As you heard Neil talk about, we're marketing earlier. It's a more consistent execution that we're seeing. So that combination of all those 3 things is really driving our success in DTC, which we're thrilled about, and we're seeing that continue into Q3.

Dani Reiss
Chairman & CEO

In terms of the productivity, Oliver...

Neil Bowden
Chief Financial Officer

Sorry, Oliver. Yes, just in terms of the productivity, we closed the year last year a little bit below that $4,000 sort of magic threshold. But I don't think anyone in this room feels that that's the opportunity. We think that's the minimum. And certainly, our historical numbers have been higher than $4,000 and well above, and we're aiming to be more in that zone than just at $4,000. And so we feel great about all the things that have happened, and we know there's a lot more to go.

Oliver Chen
TD Cowen, Research Division

Okay. And a follow-up. Any thoughts on globally in terms of U.K. softness or other regions that you're slightly more cautious on? And as we think about SG&A ahead, what would you speak to in terms of fixed versus variable that we should know about?

Carrie Baker
President of Brand & Commercial

So on the U.K., yes, so I don't think it's anything different than we've been seeing the trend. You heard Neil talk about that as well. Many brands are experiencing that. It's very different than what we're seeing in Continental Europe, so which remains strong. And so we're doing what we're focused on.

The teams are focused on maximizing every person that comes into the store, every visit online. And so that's sharper execution. I think we have opportunities still to improve that, but I think the efforts that we've been implementing the incentives in store staff, having the product inventory available has really helped us there, and we'll continue to monitor that.

Beth Clymer
President & COO

Oliver, it's Beth. I'll take your question on SG&A. Part of the reason we are so energized by the positive comp results is that, that creates a really nice opportunity for margin expansion over the medium and long term because of our fixed variable makeup. Obviously, the more we can drive from comp store sales growth, the more we can leverage the fixed costs in our retail network. So we feel really good about our revenue growth profile, allowing us to continue to drive productivity there.

Obviously, as you know, we are making investments this year, investments in Q2. That is intentional. That is to drive growth not only in peak season, but in fiscal '27 and beyond, brand relevance, store experience, right? So there are obviously investments that are pressuring the margin and the SG&A as a percent of revenue at the moment, but we feel really great about the underlying productivity and our ability to drive that margin in the medium to long term.

The next call comes from the line of Jonathan Komp with Baird.

Jonathan Komp
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I want to follow up on the comps that you're seeing. And clearly, the newness and especially some of the transitional seasonal items appear to be working. Just can you speak more on your confidence of sustaining that comps momentum across regions as you reach the seasonal and colder weather periods and any signals that you're seeing there?

Carrie Baker
President of Brand & Commercial

For sure. Thanks for your question. It's Carrie again. We're feeling really encouraged. I mean the thing to me is like despite the differences in all of our markets, the consistency of our performance there and being able -- higher conversion, the comps increasing, it's just -- it makes us feel very good, and we're also seeing that continue into Q3. I think, as I said earlier, it's really a number of factors. The teams are well trained. They are ready for peak. We've got the inventory.

And the newness we're seeing, let me comment a little bit on that. It's not just that we're broadening the assortment to more seasonally relevant. That is a big part of it. But it's also newness and animation of some of our classics. So if you're looking online or if you're going into our stores today, you'll see a big focus on our Chilliwack. And Dani mentioned some of the activations that we're doing in some of our wholesale partners. And that is a big part of what people come to Canada Goose for, but we're giving them a new reason to be excited.

So the Chilliwack is a classic product that we've had in our line for at least 10 to 15 years. When you come in store today, you see 6 different animations of it, versions of it, different fabrications, whether it's wool, a puffer version, our Chilliwack fleece is flying. That is like the #1 demand product right now. People are asking for more. So that's the way we're animating and bringing people back into store or attracting new consumers, and that's consistent across every region.

Jonathan Komp
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, Neil, maybe a follow-up. I mean the tone sounds very positive on the sales trends. It's hard to project the margin that we should expect. So could you maybe just talk about the factors that will drive changes in the leverage point as you come up on your key seasonal period here? It seems like you'd have much more ability to improve the margin performance year-over-year. But if you could talk a little bit more about some of those drivers and how they shift into Q3 here, that would be helpful.

Neil Bowden
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Jon. Yes, I think I'd point to a couple of things. So obviously, the fuel that comes from positive comps is critical to driving overall channel margin expansion as well as being able to leverage the corporate costs to the extent that they're fixed. And so we're absolutely focused on continuing, just to your first question, continuing to drive that comp sales.

Second is ensuring that the investments that we've made up to this point, whether that's marketing or whether it's store labor are delivering in season as we expected. And we've been pretty clear this year that not everything will deliver in season, but some will.

And then third, how do we get enough leverage out of maintaining a disciplined approach to the corporate kind of fixed cost here in the center so that when we grow the revenue in the channels, we are leveraging that fixed cost. And so those are the 3 levers that we're pulling. And you're absolutely right to hear degree of confidence around continuation of that top line performance and where we think we've got control over the other things.

Your last call comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.

Robert Bischoff
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

This is Robert up for Ike. Can you just talk about some of the trends you're seeing in North America? It looks like there was a drop in third quarter -- or second quarter, sorry. Is that -- was that primarily because of the wholesale shift? Can you quantify that?

Carrie Baker
President of Brand & Commercial

Absolutely. So yes, I think there's 2 things that are sort of masking the actual amazing sales results that we're seeing in DTC. One is wholesale, and that is just purely timing. As you heard Neil talk about, wholesale remains stable. Our expectations are exactly where it should be. That strategy of like intentionally pulling back and making sure that we're growing with the right partners, that is working. And so you're just going to see that timing difference there.

The second part is the intentional pullback of -- in our other channel. And so that was -- last year, it was important for helping us clear through some inventory, and that just didn't happen in Q2, and that was intentional on our part. So we're really encouraged and the momentum that we're seeing is not just in one or the other market. It's in both Canada and the U.S., and we see that again continuing into Q3.

Thank you. That does conclude our call for today. You may now disconnect.
