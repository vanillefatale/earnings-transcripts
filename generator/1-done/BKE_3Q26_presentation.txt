Good morning, and thanks for being with us this morning. Our November 21, 2025, press release reported that net income for the 13-week third quarter ended November 1, 2025, was $48.7 million or $0.96 per share on a diluted basis compared to net income of $44.2 million or $0.88 per share on a diluted basis for the prior year 13-week third quarter, which ended November 2, 2024.

Year-to-date net income for the 39-week period ended November 1, 2025, was $128.9 million or $2.55 per share on a diluted basis, compared to net income of $118.3 million or $2.35 per share on a diluted basis for the prior year 39-week period ended November 2, 2024.

Comparable store sales for the quarter increased 8.3% in comparison to the same 13-week period in the prior year, and our online sales increased 13.6% to $53 million.

Comparable store sales for the year-to-date period increased 6.3% in comparison to the same 39-week period in the prior year, and our online sales increased 11.6% to $142.9 million.

Our gross margin for the quarter was 48%, a 30 basis point increase from 47.7% in the third quarter of 2024. The current quarter margin expansion was a result of 40 basis points of leverage buying, distribution and occupancy expenses, partially offset by a 10 basis point reduction in merchandise margins.

Our year-to-date gross margin was 47.4%, up 50 basis points from 46.9% for the same period last year. The year-to-date increase was the result of a 20 basis point increase in merchandise margin, along with 30 basis points of leverage buying, distribution and occupancy expenses.

And year-to-date, SG&A was 29.5% of net sales compared to 29.6% for the same period in the prior year. The third quarter decrease was due to a 35 basis point reduction related to nonrecurring digital commerce investments made a year ago, a 35 basis point decrease in store labor-related expenses and a 5 basis point decrease in certain other SG&A expense categories. These decreases were partially offset by a 50 basis point increase in incentive compensation accruals and a 15 basis point increase in G&A compensation-related expenses.

And for the year-to-date period, our operating margin was 17.9% compared to 17.3% for the same period last year.

Thanks, Tom, and good morning. Our women's business continued its acceleration in year-over-year growth rate during the quarter, with merchandise sales increasing about 19%, which was on top of 3% same week growth a year ago.

For the quarter, our women's business represented approximately 51% of sales, which compares to 47% last year. This growth continued to be led by the performance of our denim category with women's denim increasing approximately 17.5% and average denim price points increasing from $81.15 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 to $86.95 in the third quarter of fiscal '25. This AUR increase continues to be primarily the result of strong growth in our Buckle Black Label, which has outperformed the total denim business, along with strong growth of other higher price point national brands.

Complementing our strong women's denim selection, our team continued delivering compelling trends and fashions for our guests, for the quarter, we achieved growth across all women's merchandise categories with the most notable growth in knits and sweaters, casual and fashion bottoms and accessories. In total, average women's price points increased about 6% from $49.95 to $53.05.

On the men's side, we were pleased to see growth for the second consecutive quarter with men's merchandise sales up about 1% against the prior year, representing approximately 49% of total sales compared to 53% in the prior year. This growth was also led by our men's denim category, which was up about 1% for the quarter. Average denim price points increased from $88.10 in the third quarter of fiscal '24 to $88.15 in the third quarter of fiscal '25.

In other categories, we saw nice performance in both our short and long sleeve tees business in a variety of lifestyles as well as strong selling of our vests, jackets and accessories. For the quarter, overall average men's price points increased approximately 2.5% from $54.30 to $55.70.

On a combined basis, accessory sales for the quarter increased approximately 7.5% against the prior year, while footwear sales were essentially flat. These 2 categories accounted for approximately 10% and 4.5%, respectively, of third quarter net sales, which compares to 10% and 5% for each in the third quarter of fiscal '24. For the quarter, average accessory price points were up approximately 3.5% and average footwear price points were up 4.5%.

Also on a combined basis, our kids business continued its strong growth trend, increasing approximately 22% year-over-year. This continues to be a category where our teams are excited to keep building the business and selection for our guests. For the quarter, denim accounted for approximately 46% of sales and tops accounted for approximately 29%, which compares to 46% and 29.5% for each in the third quarter of fiscal '24.

As previously mentioned, with strong selling and trends in many of our brand styles, our private label business decreased as a percentage of our total mix for the quarter. For the quarter, private label represented 47.5% of sales versus 48.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

And with that, we welcome your questions.
