[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brooke Roach from Goldman Sachs.

Brooke Roach
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Ernie, I'd love to hear a little bit more about what gives you confidence in continuing to deliver the comp momentum as we come up into a tough compare for holiday season. And then can you also give a little bit of commentary on what the benefit was to comp in the quarter from AUR and pricing growth and what your plans are for pricing and price gaps as you deliver value into the holiday season?

Ernie Herrman
CEO, President & Director

Sure, Brooke. Well, in the comp momentum, you can see we've been kind of building momentum for a bit now, right? It's going back a number of months. I think when you look around the board here at the opportunity to deliver a shopping experience and merchandise that is branded at tremendous value across good, better and best. And then you look at the lack of that customer mission being serviced really by anybody else around us, nobody's really doing that.

So -- and I'm talking good, better, best branded at tremendous value in a shopping environment, which I think over the last decade has become more important to consumers in terms of not only the merchandise, but our shopping environment is very pleasant. Our associates are very accommodating. They're happy. We're providing, I think, an overall pleasant, exciting treasure hunt shopping experience, even if they're not in for treasure hunt, our consumers, and we have data on this, really enjoy shopping us. It's a very positive experience. And contrast that with what's happening around us. And I think ultimately that's why our formula just bodes well in terms of confidence in our comp momentum. John, did you want to jump in?

John Klinger
Senior Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean just to give you some color on the cadence and the build of the comp. So the cadence in the quarter was very consistent by month, which was really nice to see. As to transactions and basket, both transactions and basket were up with basket driving a little bit more of the comp within -- and within basket, ticket was the driver.

Ernie Herrman
CEO, President & Director

Does that help you, Brooke, with that part of that question?

Brooke Roach
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Yes, very helpful.

Ernie Herrman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. But you had kind of a third part, which I believe was around the pricing gap, which it's touching on what John is getting at. But clearly, another component is our merchants are so driven by keeping a gap on our retail against the out-the-door. We've talked about that many times and I think that's what speaks to the third question you were getting at is we will continue to shop aggressively competition, which, by the way, is clearly all retail, whether it's online, whether it's brick-and-mortar at mass market, discount or department stores or specialty. And then we will ensure, as we always do, that our out-the-door retail is below their promotional retail or promotional retails. And we'll continue to do that regard -- and that's where it gets down to item and SKU and our teams are so good at staying laser-focused on executing that. So that -- by the way, I guess you could argue that's another component of being confident in our continued momentum.

Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez from Citi.

Paul Lejuez
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Just a follow-up on the traffic and ticket. I'm curious if it was mix that drove the basket when you think about the higher...

Ernie Herrman
CEO, President & Director

Sorry, Paul, that didn't come. Could you repeat that first part?

Paul Lejuez
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Sure. I'm curious if it was mix that drove the basket in terms of higher AUR, higher ticket? Or are you seeing true price increases based on what's happening in the competitive landscape? Are you seeing that opportunity to take prices higher across the assortment because others are doing the same?

And then I'm also just curious if you could talk about the income demographic comment. I think you said consistent performance. I was curious if you were referring to the United States specifically or if you can maybe talk about income demographics in other geographies as well, any differences that you're seeing?

John Klinger
Senior Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So when you break down the ticket, it was a bit more of the price versus the mix that drove that. I don't know, Ernie, if you want to expand on that.

Ernie Herrman
CEO, President & Director

Yes, sure. Yes. Paul, I think it was a combination, but I think a little bit more was due to, yes, some of the pricing that's gone up selectively throughout as other prices have gone up around us. I think you've seen many reports about other retailers talking about having made some price adjustments on certain items, categories.

Again, we, in some of those cases, have followed suit based on what we've had to pay in retail. But again, I go back to what I had said to Brooke at the end of that question, her third question is we are extremely diligent on making sure we're providing, in some cases, at least as good a value as we were prior. In fact, our value perception scores, which we are always monitoring, are extremely strong. Of course, one would probably guess that when you look at our sales, you would say that if the value perception wasn't strong, we probably wouldn't be doing these comp sales.

So, I think, as John said, that was probably the chunk of the reason. But merchandise mix does certainly impact. Again, I want to emphasize, we do not top down, drive the retail ticket. We're insisting on the right value and then our merchants down at the buyer and MM level, the ones that really determine where the retail should be.

John Klinger
Senior Executive VP & CFO

There is a good part of our mix that we're not buying the same thing over and over again.

Ernie Herrman
CEO, President & Director

That's right. Yes.

John Klinger
Senior Executive VP & CFO

When we look at ticket, we're really looking at it within the department. So -- and so there it's -- sometimes it can be a little challenging to read. But...

Ernie Herrman
CEO, President & Director

Income demo.

John Klinger
Senior Executive VP & CFO

Getting back to your income demographic, the vast majority of our geographies, it was close. I mean it's both the -- both income demographics that we kind of break it down and how we look at it were very, very close, but it was the lower income demographic that was driving the comp in the majority of our geographies.

Ernie Herrman
CEO, President & Director

Which Paul brings up because you -- I'm sure all of you have heard many different reports on, in some cases, articles about the, I guess, the upper end or luxury retail driving some of the -- again, I always emphasize the strength in our business model is that we have a balanced approach where we have all -- we try to appeal to all ages and all income demographics and we never veer off that mission really for times like this, in times when things get better or in times where people are struggling. We want to appeal to all income demographics.

John Klinger
Senior Executive VP & CFO

Which is why we're seeing consistently...

Ernie Herrman
CEO, President & Director

Consistent across everyone...

John Klinger
Senior Executive VP & CFO

All the income demographic fans we look at.

Paul Lejuez
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Just a follow-up. Is that unusual that it would be the lower income demos that are outperforming at the same time that you're seeing ticket go higher?

John Klinger
Senior Executive VP & CFO

No, it's been like that for the last number of quarters. And I mean because really for quite a long time we've been seeing strong across all income demographics that sometimes it'll tip one way or the other. That's what we're seeing is just a tipping of it rather than a trend.

Ernie Herrman
CEO, President & Director

It's not a long-term trend, yes. Yes. So -- and Paul, we have -- and when John says the strength, all the income demos are healthy, it's just that one's nudging a little bit. In other words, a lot of -- we are happy with the -- all the different income groups. That one's just nudged up a bit in the recent past.

Our next question comes from Alex Straton from Morgan Stanley.

Alexandra Straton
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I've got one for John and then maybe one for Ernie. So John, just on the gross margin guidance for the fourth quarter, can you talk about what changes to make that year-over-year expansion a little bit less than what we've seen in the last couple quarters? And then for Ernie, a bigger picture question. There's been a lot of discussion around AI disintermediation in retail, especially with the use of personal digital shoppers. So I'm just wondering how you think about what these developments mean for TJ and what your broader kind of AI strategy might be more generally.

Ernie Herrman
CEO, President & Director

Yes, go ahead, John.

John Klinger
Senior Executive VP & CFO

So on the gross margin for the fourth quarter, the reason why is it's really how we are handling our shrink accrual for the year because we had a favorable shrink came in last year, so we're up against the adjustment in the fourth quarter that brought the shrink rate down from our plan. So we have favorable shrink comparison to last year for Q1, Q2, Q3. And in Q4, we're up against a negative comparison last year. Does that make sense? I'm sorry, we're up against the positive adjustment last year this year which creates a negative comparison.

Ernie Herrman
CEO, President & Director

Is that good, Alex, on that? Yes.

Alexandra Straton
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes, it is.

Ernie Herrman
CEO, President & Director

Okay. So -- and on the -- yes, the bigger picture AI question, which, of course, no topic is highlighted more than AI in the world we're in today. Our teams are all over this from a couple perspectives. But let me emphasize that we're doing it in a TJX approach manner in terms of where would it dovetail into helping us without us swinging a pendulum and doing something that could be counterproductive. So we are pretty aggressively evaluating and testing and deploying AI really across our business to help us work more efficiently and enhance and augment really the work our associates are doing.

So you had mentioned, I think some example, but areas we would look at it right now they're testing is enhancing our fraud detection and security. There are aspects to that, that could work out well. In-store analytics, really helping with that process, enhancing customer service. I'll give you another one. HR, where I think we're going to get some really big benefit is in some HR processes where there's a lot of information that could be somewhat cumbersome. As big as we are today, I think that's going to help streamline a lot of work for some of our HR associates there.

Enhancing customer service, I think I mentioned. Marketing, a recent discussion we just had is marketing optimization. This is something going on around us, and we are taking a look. It's really at the beginning to see what processes there would benefit from us implementing AI. So we are -- I can't tell you details, but we are taking a hard look and we'll be testing some services there to see if we can move that further.

Obviously, we -- it goes without saying, we'd be looking at supporting buying and planning in a way -- again, in a way that still allows our merchants to function with the secret sauce that we do not want to be impacted by AI, if that's not appropriate. So we're always very careful with that. But of course, we want to be aware of it and look at it. And then helping IT teams deliver and operate more efficiently. That was one of the first places we were looking at this a number of years ago.

And the last thing here, Alex, I would say is we are also -- the teams are really terrific and our -- I give our IT area credit that they're always looking at what are other people doing with AI so that we're always aware, competitively speaking, so that we don't get blindsided on something we should have been looking at and somebody else is. So that's probably a little more info than you needed, but I think that kind of explains to you we're on it.

John Klinger
Senior Executive VP & CFO

Part of that last comment that Ernie made, we have established cross-functional governance, that process that just ensures that we are thoughtfully proceeding on looking at AI.

Our next question comes from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.

Matthew Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats on a nice quarter. So Ernie, could you elaborate just on the overall acceleration at Marmaxx, new customer acquisition relative to expanded basket from your existing core. And if you could elaborate on the strong start to the fourth quarter, have you seen any softening in business or just opportunities that you see for holiday this year?

Ernie Herrman
CEO, President & Director

You're laying it up for me here, Matt.

Matthew Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Always, Ernie.

Ernie Herrman
CEO, President & Director

Yes, I appreciate it. Now the new customer acquisition, clearly, we're -- it's funny. We just talked about this a week ago. I did with my marketing team and the analysis group there. We're clearly capturing new customers consistently and about the balance that we did before. We're getting equal momentum from that as well as our infrequent and frequent customer spending.

I think we have -- I give the Marmaxx team credit on just really terrific execution. They have right now, if you look in the store, a very balanced mix across all the families of business. And that's one reason I think we're capturing the market share we're capturing which is apparel has kicked in. By the way, we sometimes talk when weather has been against us. I would tell you right now, weather has helped us recently. So that certainly is a plus in Marmaxx in certain categories.

But when you look at our apparel and non-apparel business there, it's healthy across the board. So yes, I think you started to touch on this, Matt. There is no area that's really lagging too much. Otherwise, by the way, we wouldn't -- it's hard to have Marmaxx run a 6 comp if we did have a high liability department that wasn't performing. So that's been really strong.

Their inventory position, now you go to kind of the root of what's going on and why I have continued confidence back a little bit. Back to Brooke's first question is the availability in the market is just -- I've used this before, off the charts. I didn't use it in the script, but it's off the charts. So we have so much availability across the brands in many categories and some more availability in some of the categories that we hadn't seen in a while. So I think that is going to bode well for our next quarter.

And when your consumer right now, given the lack of excitement at retail around us, that's making them very open to trying us, which is why we have really strong holiday marketing campaigns set up that really talks to our value leadership over the next couple of months. And that's why I mentioned that in the script, we're so excited about the different marketing creatives, which are really aimed at keeping us top of mind with consumers and we're encouraging consumers that haven't tried us to try us for the first time. And that's why I think the new customer and infrequent customers and customers that may have shopped us a year ago and haven't been back. That's what our marketing is aimed at, taking advantage in this environment.

John Klinger
Senior Executive VP & CFO

And then I'll just reiterate what Ernie said upfront earlier in the call that we continue to fund payroll appropriately in the stores, we continue to invest in remodels in the stores. We've got fixtures that make it easier for customers to shop the stores. We're trying to -- again, we're trying to maintain that great shopping environment when the customers do come into the store.

Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.

Lorraine Maikis
BofA Securities, Research Division

Ernie, are there any categories or customer demographics where raising prices has been less successful? And how quickly can you pivot if you see pushback to some of this price over the holidays?

Ernie Herrman
CEO, President & Director

Yes, great question. We have -- we actually -- I won't say what it is. We had one category, only one, and you know all the categories we have, where we weren't happy, we pivoted back and brought the retails right back to where they were pre the adjustment. Other than that, I would say we're 95% successful on the pricing strategy. Again, we don't lead the pricing strategy. We wait for the market around us. So even on that one category, what must -- my guess is our competitors on that category probably had to adjust their retails too, because we only went up when their retails were going up. And then we found out if it wasn't good for us, there's no way it was good for them. So no, the -- other than the one I'm thinking about, we have been successful across the board.

Having said that, just on some -- we've had a couple of items, I'll hear it from a couple of the merchants where we tried this one and this one SKU. Even though it was in a category where it's worked across the board, we might have a SKU that didn't work because it might just not -- it might be bumping up against something or whatever in our own mix because sometimes they have to compete in our own mix. And even the pricing, if it went up around us, and we try to take it up because it went up around dramatic. It's still hanging with our other goods and sometimes it doesn't work.

So -- but absolutely, Lorraine, 95% successful and very few. We're very careful on it, which is why not only do we judge it off the actual hard data where we watch selling by SKU every week, we also use our value perception scores. We keep a constant pulse on that.

John Klinger
Senior Executive VP & CFO

And the speed at which we turn our inventory gives us the flexibility to react quickly.

Ernie Herrman
CEO, President & Director

Great point, John. Yes, yes.

Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo.

Irwin Boruchow
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Congrats. Two from me. Similar to Lorraine's question, Ernie, are there categories that you intentionally deemphasized or pushed harder because of tariffs just because you look at the economics of each category? I'm just kind of curious how you think about that. And then, look, clearly, your business is not seeing any issues, but very high level I'm sure you guys have tons of KPIs or markers you look at to kind of judge the U.S. consumer. Is there anything that you've seen over the past couple of months kind of going into holiday that at all shows you that the U.S. consumer is under some level of pressure? I think it's still a debate at this point. Just kind of curious how you guys view that at a high level.

Ernie Herrman
CEO, President & Director

Sure, Ike. On the first one, the deemphasizing category, so to speak, if we were running into a tariff, we have done that to a little degree. What's happened, though, the cycle tends to come back because when they're imported like that, eventually their other accounts kind of back up. And so if people back off enough, we're -- again, we're not the importer, so we're able to negotiate through the third party and we just might have a lag. We don't consciously deemphasize over the long term.

We just might take what's called our internal sales and inventory plans, they're called [ ladder ] plans. We might take those down for a couple months, but then the market cycles back. We've seen that happen numerous times because we're not ready to take a big price increase if the vendors are coming to on a category if we can't show the great value. So it kind of works its way through the system. So great question. That's -- in those cases, and yes, we have done it in a couple of cases. We just wait for the cycle to come back to us in a couple of months.

Tariffs overall, I mean, we don't really get different data than what all of you get. We can see that prices have been going up across many retailers and many categories, and it's been talked about as either it's been done or they're looking at doing it. And I would -- my barometer for our other retailers struggling a little is just the fact that the availability of merchandise across the board is so high across good, better and best. That would lead us to believe that other retailers are struggling with some of the impact of the tariffs, I guess. So -- but again, we don't get any outright. That's just a pulse from what we see in the market.

Our next question comes from Michael Binetti from Evercore ISI.

Michael Binetti
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Great quarter. Had a couple on the margin. First, on the gross margin, during third quarter, you -- I think you had started the guidance at about 5 to 15 basis points of improvement on a 2% to 3% comp. You obviously beat it by a lot. Sounds like freight was a key upside driver. So a couple questions on that. Just since the shrink dynamic should be kind of contained to fourth quarter, does that freight benefit roll off in fourth quarter? Could you talk a little bit about what's driving freight, if that's something that could contribute after fourth quarter?

Secondly, I'm also curious if there was a mismatch of any kind in the quarter between tariff costs and pricing. Also, what that dynamic looks like in fourth quarter. It sounds like you expect to offset tariffs, but I'm wondering if that -- if the tariff headwind does get tougher in fourth quarter. And then finally, just on, I guess, the pretax margins more broadly, are there any early signals of margin headwinds we should keep in mind as we look at our models for next year, either across the company or at the Marmaxx or HomeGoods division?

John Klinger
Senior Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So Michael, just on the freight piece. So for freight, it was a combination of favorable ocean rates and efficiencies that we implemented as far as movement of our merchandise, and that's really what drove that freight piece. And then as far as tariffs go, I mean, look, Q2, Q3, Q4, I mean, the tariffs are pretty consistent as far as what we're seeing. And we have every confidence that we can do exactly what we did in the second and third quarter in the fourth. So, as I said in my closing comments, we are very confident in our ability to continue to navigate the tariff environment.

Michael Binetti
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Is that freight dynamic something you think continues after fourth quarter? Or is that something that's just contained?

John Klinger
Senior Executive VP & CFO

No. It's really up to the freight -- the ocean freight providers. I mean, if they start taking ships offline and try to decrease the surplus or availability, I mean it's hard for me to answer that. It's asking me to look into the future. I can say that what we've been seeing in the third quarter is that we did see a savings in the ocean freight container rate.

Michael Binetti
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. So it sounds like it's more related to spot than contracts, so it's a little bit less visibility. And then any other new headwinds to think about as we look at the models next year?

John Klinger
Senior Executive VP & CFO

No. Yes, I'm not prepared to talk about next year right now. We're still in the process of pulling our plans together.

Our next question comes from Corey Tarlowe from Jefferies.

Corey Tarlowe
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Ernie, you commented on the value perception scores. Curious how you think about your value gaps today versus historically within the context of what you've seen from competitors and then also kind of the shape of the comp throughout the year given your comp was initially driven very much by traffic to start the year and sort of the commentary has felt in a way that it's evolved to be a little bit more driven by price, but not so much so that it's eroded your value gaps is what I think is the point, but curious to get your perspective on that.

Ernie Herrman
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Corey, spot on. That -- you summed that up very balanced is the way we would look at. The value gap today, by the way, I would tell you, has improved from where it was even a couple of years ago in terms of a couple of things. I still believe part of the value equation which has kind of evolved over the last number of years is the shopping environment that we provide to go along with the merchandise is creating, I think, an even larger value gap between us and the other retailers.

And I think if you look at our shopping in our store versus other off-pricers or other specialty stores or department stores or larger discount stores, I think you would find a very efficient, clean, organized and then treasure hunt all at the same time, combined with I believe the perceptions are spot on where our values have even improved the out-the-door retail versus others, the gap has improved. So across the board, I would say we have improved there versus historic comparisons in terms of total value. The shape of the -- I think you were asking about the shape of the comp and that being driven, it would have been a little bit more transactions you were feeling, but part of this is the retail. It was only I think it was only HomeGoods where right...

John Klinger
Senior Executive VP & CFO

HomeGoods was essentially...

Ernie Herrman
CEO, President & Director

Flat, right? And the others were still up.

John Klinger
Senior Executive VP & CFO

Yes.

Ernie Herrman
CEO, President & Director

So that's why I said your comment was spot on where it's kind of in between, and we're feeling really good about it because, again, I think there is major value gap between us and everybody else. And as John said, we've had these pricing things, but clearly it does not impact any value perception at all.

John Klinger
Senior Executive VP & CFO

Exactly. And again, driving a 5% comp and being strong across every...

Ernie Herrman
CEO, President & Director

Yes, every, our division banners, yes.

John Klinger
Senior Executive VP & CFO

It was really positive to see.

Ernie Herrman
CEO, President & Director

I would throw in our biggest -- now you can appreciate this hasn't come up yet, but my biggest challenge for this organization is when you have such strong sales momentum which keeps getting better is for us to not get over our skis and buy too much too soon. So I think we talked about that before, even a year ago, one reason we are delivering the year we're having is keeping a lot of liquidity and our merchants are able to be very entrepreneurial and very opportunistic on their buying. And that's when we provide the most exciting value, branded off-price, closeout goods to the consumer.

And so that continues to be a focus is to make sure with all this availability that's out there and combined with our strong sales, we just need to fight the urge to buy too much too soon. You know what I mean, Corey? That would probably be our biggest challenge right now because that's the #1 way we still can continue to drive our sales and profitable sales.

Corey Tarlowe
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Yes, certainly. It makes a lot of sense. And then I just had a quick follow-up for John. You mentioned in Q4 that SG&A was 30 basis points, I believe, favorable or expected to be. Could you just unpack that for us a little bit? Thanks so much, and best of luck.

John Klinger
Senior Executive VP & CFO

Yes, sure. So it's going to be a combination of incentive accrual favorability versus last year in expense savings. So last year, we adjusted our incentive accruals in the fourth quarter. So we're just -- we're comparing to that. So we have a year-over-year favorability there.

Our next question comes from Jay Sole from UBS.

Jay Sole
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Ernie, my question is, if you just take a step back and think about -- this has been a year with an unprecedented level of tariffs and you're talking about availability of inventory. I think you just said it was off the charts. Does it surprise you at all that in the year when you would think people would be making less product, importing less product, that you have seen so much availability? And if it does, how do you explain it?

Ernie Herrman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. No, great question, Jay. I have to tell you, yes, a little surprise on the degree to which the availability is there because to your point, back when -- I go back in the spring when all of this was just starting to evolve and we get -- there were some categories where -- by the way, some categories back then we wouldn't have worried about availability only because they wouldn't have been impacted as much by the tariff. It would have been a more moderate tariff. And then there are others where we might have expected a little less availability. And so yes, a little bit -- we always thought there'd be good availability.

Remember, you're never going to hear from me a concern about not having enough goods across the board, maybe in a category, a department, but you're never going to hear a concern even with tariffs about us not having enough goods, the way the model works. And the way -- by the way, and the way we have seasoned pros in all of these areas in merchandising and planning that can bob and weave to the dynamics out there. But yes, to your point, I think the degree to this, how do I explain it?

I think part of the reason you explain is you have public companies that are retailers that still have to bring in -- whether it's the e-comm players that still have to bring in goods. They're not shutting down their websites. So they're having to buy goods eventually, maybe they massaged it and moved from one category or less with one brand or more with another because of the tariffs but still creates excess inventories. There's still a down the supply chain when things slow up at retail, again, they're public. They just -- they can't afford to have a 20% decrease in their sales. So they're not cutting their spending.

Do you know what I mean there, Jay? They can't cut their ordering as extreme as the tariffs would maybe tell them they do. So I think what happens is they might be less – bring in less units, but they're going to bring in the dollars that equate given the tariff. And then if those sales don't materialize, we still end up with the extra supply of closeouts. And that's what I think as well as I think retail across the board has been a little choppy, and that's creating the excess inventory. So, yes, interesting dynamic.

Again, this is where I like to give credit to our teams because bottom up the teams assess in each area how much -- because we buy in a few different ways so they know how to -- where their core flow is coming from with certain vendors and yet all the opportunistic side, we wouldn't be in this really good inventory position. We're still being liquidity if our teams weren't so good at executing at that level. So that's where, again, very proud of what they've done in this environment. As you said, very challenging year.

Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih from Barclays.

Adrienne Yih-Tennant
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Let me add my congratulations. Ernie, we've been in the stores throughout the quarter. And I was wondering, I mean, they're extraordinarily long lines. So I was wondering if you had been seeing sort of an earlier cadence to the holiday shopping behavior and/or promotionality. Obviously, Walmart pulled forward their Black Friday. So just wondering what you're seeing there and if you expect a shift in the holiday season.

And then, John, for you on -- you've done a ton of work on supply chain and transportation logistics over the past couple of years. Outside of the freight tailwind, are you expecting to see sort of a longer-term go-forward positive impact? And does that change the leverage point on gross margin?

Ernie Herrman
CEO, President & Director

Good questions, Adrienne. Yes, no, we haven't. We don't believe there's necessarily -- on our part, there's no purposeful shift to thinking we're doing earlier. Again, we -- as we've said, we're off to a strong start. We like the way we're positioned in November already which obviously indicated we were happy with our traffic, and you've been witnessing it evidently.

I think what's also happening is I didn't get to talk about this earlier, but we -- every year, our Q4, as you've seen, has been one of our steadiest performing quarters where we have become more of a gift-giving destination. And I think that's at the root of it. I think all of the -- we've also talked about this, the social media, the coolness of shopping at TJX store, whether it's Marshalls or Sierra or HomeGoods or T.J. Maxx, you probably -- I don't know if you see them. A lot of our reusable bags show up with shoppers that bring them to their supermarkets because we've made such an impact on consumers, and they find us to be a desirable place to show their brand.

So I think as they've gotten acclimated and more desirable to shop our brand, I think that makes them think of us more for gift giving than ever before, which is also a reason I think you're seeing that. It's nothing that we purposely did for an event per se or a timing thing. I think it's the nature of the brand equity and the coolness factor that we've developed over the last handful of years that's yielding a little bit of an earlier shop of us in November.

John Klinger
Senior Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And so getting to the second part of your question, I mean, first of all, the leverage point, we still see, again, just repeating on a 3% to 4% comp with no outsized expense increases, we still anticipate being flat to up 10 basis points. And that's not changing. We don't see that changing right now.

As far as the supply chain goes, I mean, certainly, with a higher ticket. We just have to -- we're more efficient in our operational areas. There's less units to move to hit the same top line. But in addition to that, we're always looking for ways to increase the efficiency of our facilities and looking to -- rather than open up a new facility as sales go up, which we still have to do but where we can, if we can expand a facility to increase the capacity, that certainly is something we always look to do as well.

Our last question comes from Mark Altschwager from Baird.

Mark Altschwager
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

First, on segment margins, the delta between HomeGoods and Marmaxx is the narrowest we've seen in some time. Just talk about the key drivers to narrowing that gap and whether you expect that convergence to continue.

John Klinger
Senior Executive VP & CFO

I mean -- so I mean, both divisions are performing, do an outstanding job at driving both the top and bottom line. Certainly, some of the freight benefits that we've seen over time, I mean, because of the size and nature of the product have benefited HomeGoods a little bit more. But look, we're very pleased with both of our U.S. divisions, both our U.S. segments. But nothing more to add. It's just driving the top line. I mean HomeGoods has been very consistent at driving that top line and that's one of the biggest levers we have to increase the pretax profit.

Ernie Herrman
CEO, President & Director

Yes, I think Mark, just adding a little flavor to the merchandising to what John was saying is they've also -- they're constantly creating newness of vendors there and always super fast-turning business, as you know. And so I think they've been -- they're very flexible in terms of the merchandise vendor content which I think has been able to help them on their merchandise margins which probably is also a big benefit in terms of their operating income getting a little closer to Marmaxx.

I'd like to, at this point, thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to updating you again on our fourth quarter earnings call in February. Thank you, everybody.
