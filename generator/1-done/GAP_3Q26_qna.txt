Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley.

Alexandra Straton
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. Congrats on a nice quarter. Maybe for Richard or Katrina, can you just dig in a little bit more on what drove such a strong comp acceleration at the Gap banner? And also how you think about sustainable comp level for that business over time? And then maybe for Katrina, just what surprised the upside versus your initial expectations on gross margin? Curious if tariffs played a role and how you think about steady state on that line item from here?

Richard Dickson
CEO, President & Director

Alex, thank you. First off, I think it's clear our strategy is working, and it is showing up in the momentum that we're seeing in our results. All 3 of our largest brands exceeding expectations, Navy up 6%, Banana Republic up 4% and Gap delivered another standout quarter with a strong comp of 7% and that's on top of 3% last year, and it represents the eighth consecutive quarter of positive comps for us.

This consistency is setting new records for the brand, and it's reinforcing our confidence in its long-term growth trajectory, driven by compelling product assortments, partnerships and marketing have really resulted in growth across all income cohorts. We have seen more high-income consumers choosing Gap. And we really do believe that with the strong competitive position that we've taken between premium and value and the fact that we're bridging the generation gap, it's a really exciting time to see Gap continuing to accelerate.

We have been attracting a younger, highly engaged consumer, particularly with Gen Z as they discover the brand. And it's reinforcing loyalty with our core consumer. So the performance in the quarter, which, as you know, was fueled by our broad-based strength in denim, the centerpiece of our viral campaign, Better in Denim featuring the global group Katseye, did incredibly well. I mean we generated more than 8 billion impressions. I think we had over 500 million views.

It was the denim story everybody wanted to be part of. We increased our ranking in the denim category. Gap is now the #6 adult denim brand in the U.S., up from 8 last year. Collaborations are continuing to drive relevance and revenue with our latest collaboration this quarter with Sandy Liang, which was incredibly successful, again, attracting new younger customers to the brand. And it's exciting to see the brand just continuing to build on their success quarter after quarter, and we're looking forward to carrying that momentum into the holiday season and beyond.

Katrina O'Connell
Executive VP & CFO

As it relates to -- sorry, I'm going to finish up, Alex, for you on gross margin. So for gross margin in the quarter, we did exceed our expectations in gross margin by over 100 basis points, and that was actually driven by an in-line expectation as it relates to tariffs. So tariffs of 190 basis points were as expected. But the out-performance in the quarter really came from standout performance, particularly at Old Navy and Gap and better-than-expected AURs as consumers really responded to our product and storytelling, which enabled us to have lower discounting in the quarter.

And our next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with BTIG.

Robert Drbul
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

I was just wondering if you could expand a bit more on AUR trends, how you're managing AUR trends? And I guess just the growth plans that you've spoken about as you look forward maybe Q4, but even into '26.

Richard Dickson
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Bob. We approach pricing as we always have. I mean we consider all the various inputs while maintaining our overall value proposition for consumers. And in Q3, as our brands continue to gain more relevance and the rigor that we put around inventory management, as that becomes more foundational, we are increasing our price elasticity, and we've been driving higher sell-through at full price.

We did take select pricing in Q3 in select categories, denim, which saw double-digit growth and the strength of our execution is really resonating with customers, and we saw growth, as I mentioned, across all income cohorts. The sales were driven by both units and AUR. We had overall AUR improving versus last year. We saw particularly strength in Old Navy and Gap with customers that were really responding well to our style, the quality and the value, which we continue to advance. Banana Republic AURs also were strong. This is resulting in less discounting, better regular price sell-through, and it's giving us confidence that we can continue to drive AUR growth as we enter the fourth quarter.

And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.

Matthew Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats on a really nice quarter. So Richard, could you speak to drivers of the top line inflection that you saw at Old Navy this quarter? Any change in momentum, early holiday? And relative to the consistency that you've now clearly shown at the Gap concept, I guess, how do you see Old Navy differentiated as it relates to the market share opportunity for that brand? And then, Katrina, just given actions that you've taken to the cost structure, how best to think about annual operating income dollar growth if low single-digit top line was the baseline multiyear moving forward?

Richard Dickson
CEO, President & Director

Matthew, thank you for the question, and thrilled to talk about Old Navy. We had an incredibly strong quarter, comps up were 6% with the brand consistently gaining market share over the last 2 years. It is the #1 specialty apparel brand in the U.S. And the performance this quarter really speaks to the brand's strength, consistency and continued momentum.

Customers are responding to what Old Navy does best. We give great style at great value. We saw healthy growth across all income cohorts in AUR, it was driven by trend-right product, which, again, was amplified by compelling creative and better storytelling for our brands. We've been winning in the categories that we've been strategically pursuing with intent. And we've shared those along the way. Kids and baby, denim and active have all been driving the momentum.

Active in particular, was a standout in the quarter. We delivered double-digit growth. And I believe it's underscoring the power of our value proposition and innovation. Differentiation as it relates to the market share opportunities that we see, we look at partnerships, Disney's partnership with us. We just presented Jingle Jammies, which was an incredible presentation across the family. It exceeded expectations.

We just also introduced Anna Sui's collaboration with us, which was particularly meaningful as the first designer collaboration where we're bringing high fashion to a broader audience. All of this, while we're just beginning to expand the brand into Beauty, which, of course, is early days, but we see incredibly high potential opportunity for Old Navy for that category and the broader portfolio over time. So look, I'm thrilled with Old Navy's consistency in the quarter performance. And I actually am particularly excited about our holiday offering at giftable price points, and we are ready to execute with excellence.

Katrina O'Connell
Executive VP & CFO

And then, Matt, as it relates to your other question, I would say, as you called out, we've done a lot of restructuring over the last few years. And then this year, we previewed that we're saving about $150 million in our cost structure. We are reinvesting a portion of that into future growth opportunities because we want to be able to seed this next phase, which we're saying is building momentum that we hope over time leads to accelerated growth.

So balancing the savings with what we think are important investments for the long term. What I would say is this year, the operating margin that we've guided to of about 7.2% is really only modest deleverage compared to last year, and that's while absorbing 100 to 110 basis points of operating -- excuse me, of tariff impact, which does show the way we are managing the business with rigor, both through cost and margin improvements.

As we look forward, we've also said that in 2026, we don't expect the annualization of tariffs to cause further operating income declines as we work hard to mitigate those costs. Once tariffs are fully reflected in the base, we do believe the consistency in our core, combined with top line benefit related to the high potential growth opportunities that we're seeding in '26 should provide sales growth that benefits operating income over time. So more to come on what that algorithm turns out to be, but we feel good about the work we've been doing, and we're certainly pleased with our results.

Our next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs.

Brooke Roach
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Richard, how do you feel about the store fleet today across brands and banners? Are there any investments that need to be made to fuel the momentum from a shopping experience perspective? And what does that mean regarding store fleet transformation, whether that's remodels or changes in store count as you look ahead into 2026?

Richard Dickson
CEO, President & Director

Brooke, thanks for that question. Stores are a really important way for customers to experience our brand. I mean they bring our product, storytelling and service to life in a way that digital just can't. With a company operating a fleet of about 2,500 stores, we are always optimizing our retail footprint. We're closing underperforming stores. We're repositioning some locations that are more relevant to our customers, and we evaluate new store openings.

As you know, over the last several years, we've closed about 350 stores that were unprofitable. Last year, we closed about 56 stores across our portfolio. We expect to close approximately another 35 in fiscal '25 with the majority of those closures being specific to Banana Republic. I believe we're at a pivotal point right now where the fleet is really well positioned, and we've been testing new formats and experiences.

Gap Flatiron in New York has been functioning for about a year with great learnings that we've started to expand across our Gap fleet with denim shops, new refresh shop here in San Francisco and a variety of others that are on plan. Banana Republic, specifically in SoHo and other locations that we've been refreshing with some great results and of course, Old Navy and Athleta up at [ bat. ]

We continue to evaluate these tests and their performance and are getting more and more confidence in the revenue and relevance and the strong returns that they've been driving. We've begun to invest rationally and selectively in the areas that we think will drive the return that we're looking for. And we will continue to keep everybody posted as we look to the combination of repositioning our stores, refreshing must-win stores and again, looking to start to open up new stores where it makes sense strategically.

And our next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays.

Adrienne Yih-Tennant
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Congratulations. Great to see the progress at the right time. Richard, my question for you is sort of a little bit higher level since you've come, there's such a focus on product and marketing, like the combination of the flywheel effect of those. How is the appointment of design and creative, specifically Zac Posen changed the complexion of creative thinking throughout the organization? And then the marketing piece of it, how has that kind of -- how does that complement kind of the product and creating that flywheel?

Richard Dickson
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Adrienne, for the question. First off, let's just mention Zac. He's been an incredible addition to our leadership team. It's been almost 2 years ago now that he's joined and has brought significant impact on many creative aspects, I would say, both inside the company and beyond. Our objective collectively with Zac and by elevating the creative conversation across our brands, highlighting design and product as an incredibly important attribute to all of our brands has been working.

I mean we've been culturally creating moments, curated moments where our brands and our products have taken center stage, not only to some extent on the runway, but on Main Street. And we're attracting talent as well to our portfolio that might not have considered a place like Gap Inc. or our brands prior. When we talk about marketing, which I also am pleased to talk about, we know marketing is a much more complex function today than it was in the past.

And as you know, we've been working really hard at driving new narratives that put our brands back into the cultural conversation, and it's our job to be everywhere that our consumer is with the right creative messaging. I think it's obvious we're performing while we transform. We're driving digital dialogue messages with social media as the #1 platform for our consumers. Influencer content is among the most common product discovery methods amongst Gen Z and millennials, which we've been performing incredibly well with.

We actually recently launched a cross-brand content creator and social media advocacy program last month, which you might have seen. We now also have a presence on TikTok as a shop and many more. And these methodologies are proving really impactful, but they also require higher quality accelerated amounts of creative.

And lastly, we can't help but mention again, Katseye is a great example of that. I mean 8 billion impressions, 500 million views. This was a true cultural takeover. And I think it's another proof point in our playbook, and we believe we've got the means and the experiences and the brands to continue to be more effective and be more efficient in our spend as we've proven this methodology is working, and it will continue to propel us into the future.

And our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Group.

Dana Telsey
Telsey Advisory Group LLC

Congratulations on the nice progress. Katrina, one for you, one for Richard. As you think about the tariff mitigation strategies, which seem to be effective, the pricing adjustments have seemed to become less and less. Is that the right impression? And how you're thinking about pricing going forward? And then, Richard, the acceleration in store sales is impressive. In your view of the consumer overall, how are you thinking about the consumer? Does it differ by brand, lower and higher income customer, whether it's Gen Z, millennial or baby boomer, how do you think the current feeling is in the attitudes towards merchandising? How do you think of consumer demand?

Richard Dickson
CEO, President & Director

Dana, thanks for the question. I think I'm going to jump in here and take consumer first, and then Katrina can follow up with tariff mitigation answers. First, I think it's really important to share, we're seeing consistency and strength in our customer behavior. As I mentioned, we're really proud that we're winning with all income cohorts. And you could see it with the strong differentiation within our portfolio.

Together, we see equal growth across low, middle and high. And it's evidenced by our 2 largest brands, Old Navy and Gap. Now there is external data that points to, of course, the macro pressure on the low-income consumer, but our customers are finding our price value, our product, our styles. It's breaking through the competitive landscape, and we're winning. We're also doing this Dana, with less discounting. We've got better regular price sell-through, increased AUR, which is really indicating that our product is resonating.

I think you could see it when you go into our stores, we're just telling better merchant-driven stories, and it is supported by incredibly relevant marketing. We're also excited to see that the high-income consumer is discovering our fashion, quality and value. And we think that is also being driven by the relevant narrative that we've been creating in the marketplace.

So when I step back and I look at our portfolio competitively, I think our portfolio appeals to a wide range of consumers. It gives us greater flexibility in today's environment. When we look at our portfolio today versus even a few years ago, we are a much stronger portfolio of brands today. We're resonating with consumers. And it's our job on a day-to-day basis to create great product with great style and quality, exceptional value. And I think we will prevail in any marketplace if we stay consistent and true to that narrative. Over to you, Katrina, on tariffs.

Katrina O'Connell
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. So as it relates to tariffs, we did do a slight amount of pricing in the quarter, but we really honestly, Dana, approach pricing as we always do. We look at all the various inputs really with an eye to maintaining the overall value proposition for our consumers. So we did take select pricing in select categories. I think denim is a really good example at Gap, where given the strength, we were able to take slight pricing and see double-digit growth in sales in spite of that.

The strength of our execution, as Richard said, really is resonating with our consumers. And as Richard said, we saw sales come from both units and AUR in the quarter. I would say the bigger driver of the outperformance in the quarter and what we're seeing is less discounting and better regular price sell-through. And I think as Richard said earlier, that really gives us the confidence that we can keep driving AUR growth as we enter the holiday season.

And our next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.

Lorraine Maikis
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just switching gears to Athleta for a minute. How do you feel about the level and content of the inventory there? And do you have a time line for when you think that sales could begin to stabilize?

Richard Dickson
CEO, President & Director

Lorraine, thank you for that question. We're not hiding from Athleta. It's a very important brand in our portfolio. We have been disappointed in the trend. But Maggie, our Brand President, has hit the ground running in her first 90 days, and she's balancing near-term priorities with, of course, the longer-term reinvigoration objectives that we have for the brand.

As I mentioned, she's been building her leadership team to align with her vision, and she is truly setting the foundation for the brand's next chapter. A lot of work happening, editing the assortment, studying the consumer, evaluating our retail footprint and, of course, the overall customer experience.

This is a reset year for Athleta, and our focus is going to be on positioning the brand for long-term success and returning it to a rightful place as a premium purpose-driven aspirational brand. We do believe Maggie and the team are taking the right steps, and we remain confident that Athleta will emerge as a brand that really does matter even more to women through product, trend and storytelling. We understand there's a lot of work to do, but we believe we've got the right leader in place to do it, and we look forward to continuing to update you as more news unfolds.

Katrina O'Connell
Executive VP & CFO

And maybe what I'd add, Lorraine, on inventory is as we assessed Athleta in second quarter, given sort of the trend in the business, we did make some choices to lower inventory levels overall. And so we have aligned inventory for Athleta to this lower sales trend as we head in -- for Q3 and as we head into Q4. So we feel good about the levels and quality of inventory at Athleta, and we'll remain pretty prudent as it relates to Athleta until we start to see the product and the marketing get back to where we would expect it to be for this brand.

And our next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup.

Paul Lejuez
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Just to go back to the unit comments. Curious which brands you saw the greatest increases in units? And then I'm also curious on the inventory versus unit gap that you mentioned, what will that look like at the end of the year, the finish up fourth quarter and then into the first half of '26?

Katrina O'Connell
Executive VP & CFO

Paul, I'm going to take the first one, but we had a lot of trouble hearing your second question. So apologies on that one. We're going to ask you to repeat it. As it relates to units, we were really pleased to see that as our brands are gaining relevance, combined with the rigor that we're putting into the business that we're seeing our elasticity improve, and we're getting higher sell-throughs at regular price.

When we look at the units in the quarter, I would say units were aligned with where we see outperformance in the business, particularly at Old Navy and Gap, and we also saw AURs there as well. But I'm going to ask you to repeat again the second part because we couldn't hear you.

Paul Lejuez
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Sure. Sorry, Katrina. So the inventory dollars versus unit gap that you spoke of this quarter, curious what that looks like at the end of 4Q and then in the first half of next year.

Katrina O'Connell
Executive VP & CFO

Oh, thanks. Sorry about that. So we continue to keep our units below sales as we try to keep within our principles of keeping inventory tight. We want to keep maximum flexibility so that we can respond in season to various demand scenarios. and be responsive to consumer demand. So as we think about end of quarter inventory, I would expect it to be similar to how we just ended Q3.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies.

Corey Tarlowe
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Richard, I wanted to ask about the power of partnerships. And the reason being is I don't think that there's a retailer in the mall today that has done more partnerships in the time span that you've been at Gap to expand the aperture for the brand and to build, as you say, relevance in revenue.

And I was curious about what you think strategically this means for the business ahead. And then the follow-up to this is how have the consumers responded to these improvements in the brand in the way that you've been able to say, remove promos on categories like denim at Gap?

Richard Dickson
CEO, President & Director

Okay. Corey, thank you for the question. First off, I think it has been a credit to the brands and teams that have followed the methodology that we shared with our playbook. And as part of the playbook and when we look at cultural relevance, collaborations help a brand drive relevance. It broadens its customer base and continues the drumbeat between its larger partnerships and releases.

So it keeps topical in the context of the amount that we do and the timing that we do, do them. Now you have to really be authentic. It's not just a collaboration. It's a well-thought-out strategic partnership. To date, Gap brand, as you mentioned, we've launched over 13 collaborations. It continues to drive enormous excitement and attract new audiences to us. And they're very precise, and they need to be. They need to be win-win.

And most importantly, they need to be authentic to the consumer. The collaborations that we've been doing, as I mentioned, are attracting new generations to Gap, but it's also, at the same time, reinforcing the brand to those who love us for years. This is, to some extent, a balance of art and science. The latest collaboration this quarter with Gap brand with Sandy Liang in the third quarter, it drove incredible engagement and overall basket.

You asked about consumers responding in relation to it and how it affects our business. I mean more than 25% of the customers who shop these collaborations were new to Gap. And of those who shop the collaborations, 20% shop beyond the collab. So we see the attraction that these collaborations when done right, are generating for the brand. And then we -- by offering and showing other product, we're now establishing broader, bigger house files and more exciting relationships with our consumers.

We just launched the Anna Sui collection with Old Navy, which is the first designer collaboration in Old Navy, incredible success, similar engagement, a really well thought out precise partnership, and we believe a sign of things to come. So again, laddering up. It's great credit to the teams across the brands for driving the playbook, executing it with excellence and really creating win-win collaborations for the consumer and our business.

And our final question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Evercore ISI.

Unknown Analyst

It's [ Carson ] on for Michael. Katrina, probably a question for you. I appreciate the color on the wraparound effect of tariffs into 2026. But if we set tariffs aside, you had really nice underlying gross margin expansion in third quarter. The guidance implies pretty similar for fourth quarter. How much of that underlying expansion is from AUR versus other drivers? Because I think I've heard several times today, confidence in the AUR plan. So if that's a leading driver, is it safe to carry those impacts over into the next few quarters?

Katrina O'Connell
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks for the question. So the way I would answer that is our margin strength in Q3 came from a combination of favorability in commodities, aided by some supply chain leverage that we got as well as strength in AUR. As we look to Q4, what you'll see is that the tariff impact to Q4 is similar to what we just experienced in Q3.

And we're also still seeing the commodity benefits. But in Q4, we're trying to sort of stay balanced in our outlook. And so right now, what we have in is roughly similar promotions year-over-year so that we have room to compete in any environment. And so we'll obviously aspire to do better, but the upside that we saw in AUR from Q3 is not currently assumed in Q4.
