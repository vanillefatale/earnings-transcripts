Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Ryan Koontz of Needham.

Ryan Koontz
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Really nice quarter, guys. Congrats. I wanted to ask about Stellar Blu and how we should think about that trajectory? Where are we now on gross margins at this point in time? And what sort of improvements you think you can make in gross margin over the coming quarters? And as well as I also want to ask about the product cycle for this version of Sidewinder. How long do you think that lasts before you really need kind of a next-generation product in production?

Adi Sfadia
Chief Executive Officer

Ryan, thank you for the greetings. So [ SES ] is progressing very nicely. Production is ramping up. We're still behind the targeted gross margin. The first phase of production incur higher expenses than we originally expected.

We do believe that during next year, we'll see a significant improve in the gross margin that will be combined with orders for line fit on top of the retrofit that we are delivering to date.

As you can see, we announced $60 million orders, which also included initial orders for line fleet units. So we believe that once we start delivering those units, we'll see significantly better gross margins.

In parallel, the cost reduction efforts are starting to bear fruits, not as fast as we expected, but we see the seeds of it. And we believe that next year, we'll see even a higher reduction in costs.

In terms of revenues, it was close to $30 million this quarter. And overall, Stellar Blu was slightly losing. We expect them to be profitable starting Q4.

On the next-generation product, it's -- we haven't announced anything yet, but we are definitely working both on several new programs that will -- once we will be ready, we'll introduce several new ESA terminals. Our focus today is on the Ku new version and also targeting Ka version. And of course, as everyone, we are considering also a version to include Ku and Ka with introducing LEO in Ka, it might be also appealing offering as well.

Ryan Koontz
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

That's great. Really nice to hear that. And on the Peru front, you talked about the $85 million in orders. Is most of that incremental to your ongoing kind of maintenance contract there? Or is that also a renewal of that maintenance ongoing rate?

Adi Sfadia
Chief Executive Officer

Yes. The $85 million award that we received during the last few months is upgrades for additional projects. So it's on top of the existing business that we have with Pronatel. It's not a renewal. Those projects -- the original projects are about to be renewed in 4 to 7 years' time. It depends on every region when it shifts to operation. And those projects include both upgrading the network and maintenance contract until the end of the period. So some of them are for 4 years, some for 5 and some for more.

We do expect several other projects, not necessarily related, but some are also related to those projects in the coming few quarters. It will be renewals of smaller projects in scope and renewals of services that we provide to operators on top of the networks that we built in Peru.

In addition, in Peru, we expect that the government will release several new RFPs in the coming few quarters. It's delayed for more than 6 months, but we do expect to release them in the coming few months. Next year is an election year in Peru. So we do expect it to be released. So the awards will be announced before the election. But again, it's Peru, we can't control the government, so we are waiting.

Ryan Koontz
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Really helpful. And then on the [indiscernible], any impact you're seeing on bookings or product acceptance from the shutdown in the last 45 days?

Adi Sfadia
Chief Executive Officer

To be honest, yes, as everyone, we see -- we are not getting orders because of that. But we don't believe that anything is canceled. It's just delayed in new orders and probably might cause a small delay between the quarters in 2026 because there is a lead time from the day we get the orders, but we don't consider it now it's a big impact on our guidance and forecast.

Ryan Koontz
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And Gil, any impact from FX from the shekel versus dollar in the quarter?

Gil Benyamini
Chief Financial Officer

Ryan, so no, this quarter, we hardly had any impact. We do hedge the shekel looking forward. So this effect, if we will encounter it, it will only be in the second half of 2026.

Operator

The next question is from Louie DiPalma of William Blair.

Louie Dipalma
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Congrats on the guidance raise and the recent awards. My first question is, how many Stellar Blu Sidewinder aircraft are online now? I believe last quarter, you indicated there were 225 planes flying with the system. And I was also wondering, how is the antenna performing in the field in terms of connecting with the OneWeb constellation. Is the performance similar to what Starlink is achieving?

Adi Sfadia
Chief Executive Officer

Louie, today, there are slightly more than 350 aircrafts connected. We deliver more units, but connected is 350 units with more than 300,000 flight hours. The feedback that we are getting both from the customers and from the airlines that is performance is very good. They are very happy with the performance with a very stringent SLA. The antennas, the OneWeb constellation, it's limited by the modem. So we are bringing, give or take, close to 200 megabit per second on OneWeb. We can bring more, but it depends on the satellites. And I think that it's more than what you need in the aircraft. So I think that the service is at least in part, if not better than Starlink.

Louie Dipalma
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Excellent. And for my second question, you discussed on the earnings call 2 different SkyEdge IV orders that you won that were each worth more than $40 million. Are you able to provide the applications for these awards? And are there others in the pipeline just because these awards seem much larger than your traditional SkyEdge IV [indiscernible]?

Adi Sfadia
Chief Executive Officer

Yes. In general, as you know, the SkyEdge IV is a multi-application platform. So with the same platform, you can serve several applications. The main application for the orders are in-flight connectivity. So it's to increase the existing customer deployment globally with SkyEdge IV in-flight connectivity application.

Louie Dipalma
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Great. But for those orders, they don't -- they're not on the same planes as the Stellar Blu Sidewinder, right? It would be on...

Adi Sfadia
Chief Executive Officer

Can be on the same plane. The Sidewinder is a multi-orbit antenna. So on -- for example, on the [ SES ], the old Intelsat, the old Gogo, you have today with Sidewinder both Gilat modem and OneWeb modem.

Louie Dipalma
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Right. Yes, that seems like in the future for you to definitely add Gilat modems to a future successor OneWeb constellation since it seems superfluous to have 2 different modems on the same plane.

Adi Sfadia
Chief Executive Officer

Yes. The industry wants to have virtualized or several waveform that will run on the same hardware. It's something that everyone wants and then Gilat has the ability, of course, to deliver things like that based on the road map and the relevant customers.

In addition, this quarter, we announced that we signed a strategic agreement with an Asian Pacific operator for SkyEdge IV. So we added another customer to the SkyEdge IV platform. And over there, the focus will be fixed application, I would say, especially cellular backhaul.

Louie Dipalma
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Great. And my third question, for the $60 million Stellar Blu order, you mentioned how for some of the installations, it will support, I think you said line fit...

Adi Sfadia
Chief Executive Officer

Correct.

Louie Dipalma
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

But what is the timing of when the factory installations with Boeing will start?

Adi Sfadia
Chief Executive Officer

So we are progressing. We expect to get some of the certification before the end of the year that will allow in aircraft installation and some at the beginning of next year. So we'll be able to have a full installation towards mid next year.

Louie Dipalma
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Great. So by the middle of 2026, that should start. Excellent. And my fourth and final question, as it relates to the Stellar Blu milestones, I believe one of the milestones, the second one was about attaining $120 million in new Stellar Blu backlog by the end of 2025. And I know you received that $60 million order, but do you expect to that milestone to be hit?

Adi Sfadia
Chief Executive Officer

This is a good question. We are -- the earn-out milestone is until give or take mid-December. We are in advanced negotiation to get a very large order from one of our customers. And we want the order as soon as possible. So there is a decent chance that we'll need to -- we'll be able to achieve the milestone and pay the earnout. We still need to comply with several commercially -- customer commercially requirement and relevant gross profits and things like that. But in general, we are on track.

Operator

The next question is from Chris Quilty of Quilty Space.

Christopher Quilty
Quilty Space Inc., Research Division

I had a couple of follow-up on IFC and Stellar Blu. Revenues were down sequentially. And obviously, you're ramping production, but is that more timing of orders? Or is there a seasonality component? And should we expect revenues to continue to ramp? And is there seasonality in Q4?

Adi Sfadia
Chief Executive Officer

In general, we are delivering mainly the terminals, but there are some auxiliary and avionics that is onetime per quarter. So it might create some bumps during the quarters. In general, the last 2 quarters, production is stable. We managed to overcome the supply chain issues that we had with one of the components. So we do expect to ramp up of production in Q4. We can deliver around 70 to 80 units per month, and we are on track to reach that. I believe that next year, we'll be able to deliver slightly more than that.

Christopher Quilty
Quilty Space Inc., Research Division

Good. And I think you had originally talked about 100 a month earlier this year. Is that the target for '26?

Adi Sfadia
Chief Executive Officer

Something like that, yes, in subject, of course, for backlog and orders, but something like that is our target for next year.

Christopher Quilty
Quilty Space Inc., Research Division

Got you. And I think when you acquired Stellar Blu, it had about 1,000 in backlog. Or is the backlog up? Or are you working down the backlog from here? Or I should say, maybe where do you expect as you exit the year with large orders that you expect to close, would the backlog be up or down from that?

Adi Sfadia
Chief Executive Officer

It was slightly below 1,000 units in backlog. And we are, give or take, now at the same level that we were because we received a large order at the beginning of Q3. And if the order that we are now negotiating will mature, I believe that we will end up the year with an even higher backlog than we entered the year.

Christopher Quilty
Quilty Space Inc., Research Division

Got you. And again, I know the original target was exiting the year with 10% EBITDA. I'm assuming you're not going to hit that because you're behind with the component issue. But since you just raised EBITDA guide, where across the portfolio did you make up the difference for Stellar Blu coming up a little bit short?

Adi Sfadia
Chief Executive Officer

Yes. So we do have a very nice growth that we see in the Commercial and also on the Peru side that outperformed our EBITDA expectation. On the Defense, as we said at the beginning of the year, we significantly increased our investment, increased sales and marketing and the R&D investment in order to support future business development. And it seems on track. We saw a very nice orders this quarter. We hope that the shutdown will end soon, and we'll see also additional orders as we expect Q4 to be strong in booking as well, and we expect to see revenue growth also next year.

Christopher Quilty
Quilty Space Inc., Research Division

Okay. You mentioned Commercial and specifically cellular backhaul, which has been suck and wind for the past year. Was it just a good quarter? Or do you see that trend in cellular backhaul starting to gather steam?

Adi Sfadia
Chief Executive Officer

It was a relatively small order on cellular backhaul. The main growth on the Commercial side is the IFC business that we have and slightly on the fixed side, but the main growth engine is IFC.

Christopher Quilty
Quilty Space Inc., Research Division

Got you. And back to Stellar Blu, sorry, there's -- the third earn-out is based upon the 4 strategic wins. Have they -- have you closed any of those? Or is the fourth quarter large order associated with that? And how do you feel still on track for those events?

Adi Sfadia
Chief Executive Officer

So up until today, we haven't closed any strategic deal. The large order is not associated with a new strategic deal. It will come from existing customers. We have -- we started several negotiations with customers that can be considered a strategic deal. I remind everyone that the strategic deal is something like, for example, additional line fit agreement with minimum commitment of at least $35 million with a significant gross margin. And we are in initial stages of discussion. So I can't predict right now if [indiscernible] contract will be signed until mid-June next year. But no doubt the strategic deals will increase significantly our addressable market. So it's something we invest a lot and a lot of efforts are on that.

Christopher Quilty
Quilty Space Inc., Research Division

A quick question. I know you did a 6-K when you filed for the private placement, but I didn't see a 6-K when it closed. Is it fair to assume that all the terms in the original 6-K were the same for the close?

Adi Sfadia
Chief Executive Officer

Yes. The money received $66 million, net of slightly below $1 million of costs.

Christopher Quilty
Quilty Space Inc., Research Division

Okay. And just to confirm, if you could a bit later, but what was the closing share count? I just wanted to confirm that. And I guess the other question was CapEx was up kind of big in the quarter. Was there anything specific going on there?

Gil Benyamini
Chief Financial Officer

So the closing share count is a little bit above $64 million. And what was the second half? Sorry, I didn't hear it clearly.

Christopher Quilty
Quilty Space Inc., Research Division

CapEx.

Gil Benyamini
Chief Financial Officer

The CapEx. So I mean CapEx is going as usual. I mean it's within the original planning, a little bit higher than last year, but as expected. So no real news over there.

Christopher Quilty
Quilty Space Inc., Research Division

Got you. And maybe final one for you, Gil. I mean, obviously, this was Stellar Blu drag on the gross margins, which kind of ticked down below 30% for the first time in a while. Where do you expect to sort of -- I could say, exit Q4, but if we look at maybe '26, I know you're not providing guidance, are we back more at the mid-30% gross margin as that product line picks up?

Gil Benyamini
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I believe that this would be a fair statement. We also have a burden in the gap of about 2% in our gross margin of depreciation of the backlog. So this will be gone sometime during the first half of '26 or maybe even before. And then we'll get this 2% in the gap as well. So I think that the mid-30s are a fair statement. And of course, as more line fits and the cost reduction efforts will kick in, we may see even higher gross margins looking further.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Benyamini, would you like to make a concluding statement?

Gil Benyamini
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I want to thank you all for joining us on this call and for your time and attention. We hope to see you soon or speak with you on our next call. Thank you very much, and have a great day.

Operator

Thank you. This concludes Gilat's Third Quarter 2025 Results Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may go ahead and disconnect.
