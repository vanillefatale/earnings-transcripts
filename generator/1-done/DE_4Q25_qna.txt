Question-and-Answer Session

Josh Beal
Director of Investor Relations

We're now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. In consideration of others and our hope to allow more of you to participate in the call please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies.

Stephen Volkmann
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I guess I will focus on tariffs, and you talked about the $1.2 billion, I think, headwind. I think that was your '26 number. But how are you thinking about offsetting that? And over what period would you think that perhaps you'd be able to kind of recapture that? I'm trying to think a little bit about the cadence of the year. I assume you'll improve as the year progresses, but I'm curious how you're thinking about it.

Josh Beal
Director of Investor Relations

Yes. Thanks, Steve, for the question. You got the numbers right. So it's $1.2 billion is the pretax tariff hit in 2026, that's about $600 million incremental from the $600 million that we saw in 2025. Run rate of the tariffs by quarter is pretty evenly spread, roughly $300 million per quarter. If you look at our price/cost expectation for 2026, inclusive of tariffs in that number, we expect to be price/cost positive. So we'll start to capture back -- we'll capture the incremental exposure this year and some of the exposure that we saw in 2025. That won't get us fully there, but it gives us a good chunk along the way. We'll continue to execute activities to mitigate that. We expect to take some continued price in the future as well to cover that additional piece. Thanks for the question, Steve.

Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Truist Securities.

Jamie Cook
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Just a question on Production and Precision Ag. Just on a 7% sales decline, the implied decrementals, I think, are approaching 60%. So just trying to understand that. I mean, I'm assuming a good portion of that is tariffs. So how much is allocated to tariff? And also just your comments on mix, understanding North American large ag is going to be down a lot, but you've also spoken to improving profitability in other regions, in particular, Brazil. So if you could just unpack the decremental margin on the sales decline.

Josh Beal
Director of Investor Relations

Yes. Your numbers are right, Jamie. If looking at PPA specifically into 2026, it's around 60% would be the implied decremental margin. Tariffs for that business have approximately 1.5 points or so margin impact for the full year of 2026. So if you back out that piece, it takes decrementals to kind of the low to mid-50s. So still elevated above normal levels for PPA. And that delta between normal would be the geographic mix that you're seeing. You're right, that profitability levels around the world have improved. We've talked to that. But still North America, large ag remains our most profitable market. So it is negative mix for the year. And just given the magnitude of decline, that's what's driving the higher level of decrementals next year.

Our next question comes from Kristen Owen with Oppenheimer.

Kristen Owen
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

I wanted to double-click on the large ag price assumption, that 1.5%. I think when we were talking about early order program, that number in North America was closer to 3% to 4%. So could you just help us unpack that 1.5%? How much of that is being driven by maybe some of the geographic mix? Just a little bit more color on the underlying assumptions for that number.

Josh Beal
Director of Investor Relations

Yes. Thanks for the question, Kristen. You're right, early order programs in large tractor pricing in North America for 2026, list price increases are in the range of 3% to 4%, and that's held. What you're seeing with the 1.5% price guide is a couple of things. One thing you're spot on is geographic mix. We talked about Brazil in 2025. We did very strong price in Brazil in '25, mid-single-digit price increase positive. It will still be positive in 2026, but more muted. Think about closer to the guide range. So that is pulling down some of the list price. The other thing that's happening in North America is a, I call it, a parts mix versus complete goods. As we go down in the cycle, parts make up a bigger mix of our sales in a given year. And our price -- parts pricing, excuse me, was a little more muted for 2026. So the combination of those 2 is really what's pulling down that guide versus the list price increases.

Deanna Kovar
President of Worldwide Ag & Turf Div, Production and Precision Ag and Americas and Australia

Yes. Thanks for unpacking that, Josh. This is Deanna. And as we think about North American pricing overall, we go back to 2 of our priorities. And first is the continued focus on use reduction. So you will see us continue to provide pool fund opportunities to our dealers at a similar level in '26 as we did in 2025. And from an overall pricing standpoint, we remain mindful of where our customers are at in the cycle and maintaining our opportunities for the future.

Our next question comes from Tim Thein with Raymond James.

Timothy Thein
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

The question is on production costs in '26. You highlighted tariffs, but just ex that, you saw kind of a build throughout '25 just in terms of production costs. How are you thinking about that as we look into '26? Obviously, a number of pieces that flow into that. So maybe just some help in terms of for the overall equipment ops, how we're thinking about production costs.

Josh Beal
Director of Investor Relations

Yes. Thanks, Tim, for the question. Yes, if you back off the incremental $600 million of tariffs and production costs, we would still expect to be slightly unfavorable for production cost in 2026. But there's a few moving pieces there. Overheads for our business, particularly in large ag are expected to be unfavorable next year. We do have some headwinds in our North American labor from our current contract. 2026 is a step-up year in that contract for production labor. So that provides a headwind. That's largely offset by some favorability in profit sharing that we'll see next year just on lower income levels.

Material ex tariffs, we'll be slightly negative, pretty close to flat. That does include the inflationary impact of indirect -- impacts of tariffs that we're seeing in the business, but slightly negative when you roll that all together. But again, I think the point to make, price/cost, we'd expect to be favorable for the full year. And again, that helps offset some of the tariff costs that we saw in 2025 that we weren't able to mitigate with price that year.

Josh Jepsen
Senior VP & CFO

Tim, this is Jepsen. I'd say the other thing is we still have a bunch of opportunity and runway as it relates to taking cost out of product and process production costs. So I think we -- the teams have done a really good job over the last couple of years, and we think that will continue. So we're by no means done on that journey. And I think that will continue to create opportunity for us to grow margins, particularly as we've seen some of these headwinds here over the back half of '25 into '26.

Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI.

David Raso
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Given the full year large ag sales guide in the first quarter implied a flat, it's implying the rest of the year down 9%. I was just curious, when you think of PP&A for the rest of the year after the first quarter, are we down every quarter? And then maybe to help us with the margins for the rest of the year, any cadence you can give us on the pricing, right? Obviously, the pricing was up. I know it was an easy comp in Brazil. But just the 1.5% for the full year, just how to think about that cadence, just so to think how we get over the hump on kind of price cost later in the year if we don't have any growth in any quarter for large ag.

Josh Beal
Director of Investor Relations

Yes. Thanks, David, for the question. As Deanna talked earlier, seasonality will be a little different for large ag next year given our leaner start in Q1. We will see that typical ramp-up in the second quarter. And actually, you're going to have fourth quarter, that's going to be particularly strong as well, just given some of the timing of the shipments. To your question, we would expect to be down year-over-year in all those quarters, just given the level of decline that we're seeing. But you see margin improve quite a bit as you get into the second quarter, and we'll stay at those higher margin levels through the balance of the year. It's really an impact on Q1, given the lean production that's driving that.

Josh Jepsen
Senior VP & CFO

David, this is Jepsen. The other thing I'd add is we would expect post 1Q to kind of return to more normal seasonality, highest net sales, highest margin in the second quarter. So a more traditional seasonality as we go from there. And then if you just step back and look at 2Q through 4Q, those margins, we would expect based on the guide to be north of 14% or around there. So a pretty big step-up and then more even performance through the remainder of the year.

Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Wells Fargo.

Jerry Revich
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I'm wondering if you would care to provide an update on the expectations for See & Spray in terms of deliveries of retrofit kits into the U.S. for '26 and any expectations on acres coverage and overall, as we look back on fiscal '25, any update on progress on the subscription build-out that you can share?

Josh Beal
Director of Investor Relations

Yes. Thanks, Jerry. Happy Thanksgiving to you as well. I mean maybe a couple of points there. First, just as we look at take rates of See & Spray on our 2026 early order program at a pretty similar level to what we saw in 2025 in terms of that factory installed piece. We'll need to see what happens with retrofit orders, which tend to be placed over the course of the winter. But from a take rate standpoint, we're a pretty similar level to what we saw in 2025. I think one point to make on acres covered is the returning customers that add machines in 2024 and moving into 2025, we saw them cover on average about 20% more acres of their operation in the 2025 year. And that's a positive sign to us for a number of reasons. It validates what Deanna said earlier that the technology is working. It's delivering savings. And as a result, we see customers increasing utilization year-over-year. So our expectation is to continue to grow that number in 2026.

Deanna Kovar
President of Worldwide Ag & Turf Div, Production and Precision Ag and Americas and Australia

Yes. And this is Deanna. In addition to the increasing installed base with new model year '26 sprayers coming out of the factory and additional retrofit kits, increased per machine usage in their second year. We also know that See & Spray is expanding globally as we see other markets in the world beginning to take up this technology as well. So our expectation is to see growth in acres covered in 2026, and we look forward to seeing our customers have those great savings that we saw in 2025 continue.

Our next question comes from Chad Dillard with Bernstein.

Charles Albert Dillard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

So a question for you on your guidance. So as we think about 2026, to what extent does it embed any additional farmer assistance from the government? And then also, just like how do you think about the operating leverage of the business coming out of this deeper than normal cycle?

Josh Beal
Director of Investor Relations

Yes. Happy to, Chad. I would say our baseline expectation is not for any more assistance. I mean we base our forecast off of what we see in the market today, informed by our order velocity, and Deanna mentioned this in the comments that we can see order velocity change. And we've seen some positives over the last, call it, month or so. As an example, the trade agreement with China, we've seen a pickup in purchases of soybeans, and that's been reflected in the soy price as well. So we'll see how the rest of the year plays out. We've intentionally put some flexibility in the back half to respond to changes in velocity, and we'll see how that plays out over the balance of the year.

Josh Jepsen
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Chad, this is Jepsen. As it relates to leverage, your question on kind of what -- as things inflect, I think as we start to see those volumes pick up. And even in Production & Precision Ag, as we discussed, kind of first quarter versus the rest of the year, you see some of that improvement and benefit as we go through the year. Clearly, we're seeing that on small ag and turf and construction, even with, call it, 10% increased sales, those, particularly if you take out the tariff impact, those incrementals are really solid. So I think that's a positive reflection of that. I think across the businesses, too, we're seeing more from a technology perspective, whether that's in Construction and Forestry, where we saw 20% growth in technology sales there, the opportunities in small ag and turf continuing to present themselves.

So I think the combination of the work we've done on the cost structure. Obviously, we've got more work ahead of us as we work to mitigate and take out some of that tariffs. But I think the leverage for us as we inflect will be positive from a margin perspective.

Our last question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS.

Steven Fisher
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I wanted to just clarify a couple of assumptions that you mentioned in the dialogue. I think there were some folks that were surprised to see the expectation of South America flat in light of some of the sort of incremental caution we've seen there, but it sounds like you cited some potential for lower interest rates. Can you just kind of give us a little more color on your confidence there? And then on the small ag side, you cited some expected improvement in -- or better results as a result of better housing activity. Can you just clarify if you've seen any indications of that already?

Josh Beal
Director of Investor Relations

Yes. Thanks, Steve, for the question. A couple of things on South America, we've talked about kind of a mix of caution and optimism in that region. And as we've seen, I think, over the past quarter or so, it's probably a bit more caution there. And interest rates have been a big driver. The benchmark rate at 15% is certainly having an impact on replacement. As we look at expectations over the last month or so, inflation expectations have eased a little bit. And as a result, you're seeing expectations for that rates to come down by a couple of points over the course of 2026. So obviously, we need to see how that plays out, and that will be impactful on the market. But that's -- I think that's embedded sort of in that combination of caution and optimism, which is what's reflected in the flat guide.

The only thing I would say is just on our order books in the region, they look really strong. I mean we are about 5 months out in Brazil. So we've got pretty good coverage through most of the first part of the year. Obviously, we need to see how that plays out in the back half. But from an order velocity standpoint, it looks good.

Josh Jepsen
Senior VP & CFO

I think one other positive there in Brazil is on high-value crop as we've seen some tariff relief on things like coffee, beef, citrus, particularly if you think about our small and mid- tractor business, I think that bodes well for the industry and in turn for us and our dealers as well.

Josh Beal
Director of Investor Relations

On small ag, Steve, and specific to turf, our forecast is based off of housing starts coming up a little bit next year, not a massive increase, but a low single-digit increase in home sales, I should say, not housing starts, home sales in 2026. That's based off of some expectations around easing in the U.S. We'll see how that plays out. But as we see home sales come back, that tends to be supportive of our turf business. And so we've got some modest growth in turf as well, which is reflected in that small ag guide of flat to up 5%.

Josh Jepsen
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. One thing I'd add, this is Jepsen. I think the some -- the prospect of a little more -- a few more interest rate cuts and what that could mean for housing, both for our earthmoving and compact construction and turf are all positive, particularly given just the low levels of inventory, we're under-inventoried from a single-family housing perspective. So I think that a little bit of continued rate easing there would be positive.

Josh Beal
Director of Investor Relations

Yes. Thanks for the question, Steve. This concludes today's call, and we really appreciate everybody's time with us today. Just as a reminder, we'll be hosting our upcoming Investor Day on December 8. You can find additional details for the event in the appendix of today's slide deck. And for all those of you in the U.S. who are celebrating, we hope you have a great Thanksgiving holiday. Have a great day.
