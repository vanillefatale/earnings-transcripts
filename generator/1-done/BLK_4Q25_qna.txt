[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler of Bank of America.

Craig Siegenthaler
BofA Securities, Research Division

And I have to congratulate you on the record base fee organic growth because 12% is pretty impressive for a $14 trillion manager.

Laurence Fink
Founder, CEO & Chairman

Well, I hope it's going to be impressive when we're a much larger manager than $14 trillion.

Craig Siegenthaler
BofA Securities, Research Division

As we look ahead to 2026, can you flush out what you're all seeing and thinking on the net flow pipeline? And a sort of follow-up would be your money market business, which is not a new modern business, has done really, really well over the last 5 years. Higher rates has been a factor there. But with the Fed cutting, do you see flows reversing in this business? And if it does, where do you think that liquidity goes?

Martin Small
Senior MD, CFO & Global Head of Corporate Strategy

Thanks, Craig. It's Martin. Happy New Year. Let me just start by saying that organic base fee growth continues to outperform our 5-plus percent baseline target, 10% in Q3, 12% print in Q4, 9% for the year. And it's the momentum, I think, that really gives us a lot of energy. The growth has ticked higher each quarter. We were 1% to start 2024, 6-plus percent each quarter this year and then ending with 2 back-to-back quarters that are at double digits. That means clients want to do more business and are giving more business to BlackRock. I think the success we've had with this structural growth strategy, it's driving strength and it's doing it across market environments in an all-weather way. And with more growth coming from our pipeline of private markets, systematic strategies, models, SMAs, digital assets, we think we can power organic base fee growth that's more consistently 6%, 7% or higher.

And in supportive market environments, I think like Q4, where there's some risk-on sentiment for higher fee, international, precision exposures, private markets, that can tilt even higher. But we've always talked about our strategy being grounded in the whole portfolio. It's always been about breadth and serving every corner of a client's portfolio. This year we had really excellent breadth in organic base fee growth and we're seeing that same breadth in our pipeline. Our fundraising plan is diversified across infrastructure, private financing solutions, multi-alternatives. And I think 2026, to your point on money funds, it's shaping up to be the year of a steeper yield curve. And we think that era of easy 2a-7 fund income looks to be fading. We think that bond returns are going to be driven more by income rather than rate moves or spread compression.

And I think even though cash is always going to be an allocation in a well-balanced portfolio, we'd expect that rate cuts are going to cause money market yields to fall and that some of the best opportunities for investors to be locking in bond yields are going to be in intermediate-term bonds. I think if the bond team was here, they'd say there's a generational opportunity to earn high-quality, steady income in the front and middle of the yield curve using that full toolkit in fixed income, credit, securitized, government bonds, munis, active and index. And we're seeing that energy on our platform. We saw more than $80 billion of fixed income flows in Q4 and more than $40 billion outside the new Citi mandate. iShares bonds had $52 billion in Q4, $175 billion. That's 18% organic growth for the year. We manage over $3 trillion in fixed income.

So we think we can meet clients with fixed income offerings across sectors and durations wherever they need it and to do it in a vehicle that works best for them. That's an ETF, it's a separate account, a mutual fund or even yield-oriented exposures being a top CLO issuer and manager and by blending public and private fixed income through direct lending BDCs like HLEND. Our fee yield on new assets to the firm in this pipeline is running 6 or 7x higher than the fee yield on new assets in '23. And we think clients want to do more with BlackRock across the platform. We saw it in the 2025 activity and in the early momentum in '26. So it gives us confidence that we're on the right track and gives us a lot of energy about what 2026 can look like on the organic growth front.

Laurence Fink
Founder, CEO & Chairman

Let me just add one more point. As global capital markets grow, cash is going to grow alongside of it. So the base holdings of cash will be elevated as long as the global capital markets continues to grow. And if you overlay -- if tokenization becomes more real and the opportunity to have a tokenized money market fund alongside tokenizing other assets, I actually believe you're going to see probably above-trend holdings in cash. That being said, I agree with everything what Martin said, we're going to see much more -- you're going to see more and more investors going up the curve, especially if the yield curve becomes steeper and steeper, which probably is going to be the outcome.

But I think we have to look at the overall scale of the capital markets and its growth globally and that is one of the foundational reasons why cash holdings will -- they look larger than ever, which they certainly are. But I think as the capital markets grows, so does holdings in capital markets cash. And I think that is important -- there's an important connection between that. And it's not -- it's -- cash is just not an outcome of people are nervous and holding and they're not looking to do it. As the capital markets grows and as more people's wallets are in the capital markets, the role of the money market fund just grows. And I think that is one of the foundational reasons why we continue to believe that money market holdings will continue to be quite large.

Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.

Michael Cyprys
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Wanted to ask one about Asia. I was hoping you could speak to your priorities across your footprint in Asia, from your local partnership in India to initiatives you have in Japan, among other countries. How are you looking to accelerate growth and expand contribution from Asia over the next couple of years? And what aspects might be most meaningful to the overall firm?

Laurence Fink
Founder, CEO & Chairman

Well, I would say, first and foremost, Asia capital markets grew faster than the U.S. capital markets. More IPOs in Asia, especially in Hong Kong. So let's just start with that foundational base. The capital markets are growing faster there. You're seeing historical changes in Japan because the NISA accounts and retirement accounts, you're just seeing more of wealth entering the capital markets out of the banking system. And that just represents more and more opportunities. So Japan has been an exceptional platform for growth, the insurance industry in Japan, the pension fund industry as the NISA accounts grow. So that's just one really good foundational example.

As I said, the IPOs in Hong Kong and the scale of wealth management in Hong Kong and Singapore, the wealth that is being generated in Southeast Asia, all leads to bigger opportunities, not just bigger opportunities to manage the money but bigger opportunities to invest like GIP invested in the airports of Malaysia. In India, I believe we have the best single platform to grow in India with the JioBlackRock partnership. I talked about the growth in 2025 but we have -- we believe that the transmission of the growth of the capital markets in India is just at the very beginning. Historically, Indians kept most of their money either in gold or in cash. And I think the opportunity to develop a self-directed retirement platform in India is real. And as the platform grows in terms of retirement, the opportunities for us are very large. But even in places like in the -- in Saudi Arabia, there's conversations going on now to really build a Pillar Two retirement system there and then obviously, a Pillar Three and we're engaged in those conversations and opportunities.

So historically, we looked at a lot of these markets who were exporters of capital. But now in many cases, they are importers of capital but more importantly, they're developing their own capital markets. This is a trend that I've been talking about for years. And I think it's just that we're at the early stages of the growth of the capital markets in every place in the world. If you look at our growth rates, the double-digit growth rates in base fees in Lat Am, it is another example of the growth of wealth and the opportunities we have. And so the key is, BlackRock is going to grow as long as the world and the global capital markets grow. But I would -- what I would clearly say what '25 indicates and what '26 offers is the growth of these capital markets are very beneficial for platforms like BlackRock and we are involved in these conversations. We're building our platform in each and every country. And I believe this is one of the real foundational opportunities for us in the future.

Your next question comes from Mike Brown with UBS.

Michael Brown
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So Larry, you touched on the insurance channel in your prepared remarks and BlackRock is a major player in the space and it's about 5% of your AUM today. But certainly, competition seems to be rising in the space. Can you just talk a little bit about how your differentiated offering like a full spectrum cash to private credit differentiates here and maybe unpack your comments about how the demand for the channel is shaping up here in 2026?

Martin Small
Senior MD, CFO & Global Head of Corporate Strategy

Thanks. Maybe I'll start, Martin. And then I know Larry will add some color. So I'd start with, yes, the balance sheets of the world's largest insurance companies were traditionally invested in public fixed income. BlackRock has been very successful at capturing those allocations. And today, we're the largest insurance company general account manager in the industry with $700 billion in assets, more than 450 insurance relationships. HPS also manages over $60 billion of credit assets for over 125 insurance companies. And I think with our combined platform, we're better positioned than ever to be a high-grade solutions provider. We also have service to the largest insurance companies on our Aladdin platform as well as an array of middle office services and accounting services.

We think that private credit and building great public private portfolios is a very important growth vector within private markets and there's an opportunity for growth with asset-based finance and private high-grade with insurance companies. Just the penetration in this market is much smaller when compared to the corporate credit market. We have over 20 conversations right now where we're working on high-grade SMAs with leading insurers and building private high-grade portfolios. A number are in later stages. We'd hope to start seeing deployments pull through, through the second half of 2026. And we're really focused on 3 things with them. The first is delivering better outcomes for our insurance clients by working with them to migrate something on order of 10% of their existing public fixed income assets into private high grade. So think of a $700 billion base migrating to $70 billion on order of that in private high grade.

The second is expanding high-grade mandates, meaning new assets and winning new assets with clients away from our existing book. And the third is also pursuing strategic partnerships, minority investments to increase the pool of insurance assets managed here at BlackRock, similar to the minority investment and strategic alliance that we announced with Viridium last year. I think on our competitive advantages, I'd note that insurance company asset management, it's a highly customized effort working with clients every day. It's not one of these mandates that's give me a benchmark and I'll beat it and give you a monthly report. Teams are basically in-sourced by the insurance company to be looking at cash flows, to be thinking about credit, to be thinking about the intersection of accounting and capital and managing those portfolios. It is a highly interactive day-to-day thing.

So being able effectively to blend turnkey full-service capabilities for insurance companies, that's a key competitive advantage for BlackRock. Integrating public fixed income, private credit, Aladdin, accounting, middle office services makes working with BlackRock a performance enhancer, a scale enabler. So there's no doubt that this space has become more competitive, especially in private high grade. But I think our experience is that insurance companies want a full-service partner and that we're well positioned to play that role given our track record in public fixed income technology and world-class capabilities in private credit.

Your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

So a question to you guys about margins. Larry, you mentioned it a couple of times and Martin did as well. Obviously, the business has grown really well. You outlined a number of really compelling initiatives, how this growth could continue for '26, '27. So when I think about the 45% operating margin, excluding performance fees that you sort of highlighted for 2025, how should we think about that progressing over the course of '26, assuming kind of normal markets? And then, Martin, just a follow-up for you, the specifics around G&A, I heard mid-single digits but maybe you guys could just remind us what the right base is.

Martin Small
Senior MD, CFO & Global Head of Corporate Strategy

Sure. Thanks, Alex. Happy New Year. So BlackRock, as I mentioned, we continue to deliver industry-leading margins. As we talked about at our Investor Day, we continue to target 45% or greater adjusted operating margin profile with our margin on recurring fee-related earnings running higher. Our operating margin in the quarter was 45%. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we continue to deliver margin expansion on recurring fee-related earnings. So excluding the impact of performance fees and related comp, our margin would have been 45.5%, up 30 basis points. Think of that as more akin to an FRE margin burdened for stock-based compensation. This growth here at BlackRock is fueled by strong FRE growth in our private markets franchises, along with high-value, higher fee rate and scaled strategies in active ETFs, digital assets, systematic equities and other areas.

So we think that over time, we'll see the margin on fee recurring earnings driving upwards toward the trajectories of the best-in-class private market names, so think north of 50%. A couple of things. I'd remind you that we defer a portion of compensation linked to performance fees for talent retention. So in years where we see higher performance fees, we also see higher deferrals, which impact comp in future years. We continue to drive operating leverage and growth through technology and automation using the benefits of size and scale to reduce costs, strategically footprinting our business. And as we set out in the Investor Day, we're targeting that 45% or higher greater adjusted operating margin. We're delivering steady operating margin expansion before the GIP, Preqin and HPS transactions. As we talked about during the announcement of those transactions, GIP and HPS both have 50% or higher FRE margins.

So that's accretive to our margin on fee-related earnings. So we think the growth in these franchises alongside the highly scaled platforms like iShares, cash, model portfolios, they can fuel higher margins on fee-related earnings and over time, our overall adjusted operating margin. And just in terms of your question, Alex, on G&A, we've talked about our financial rubric and how we aim to align organic revenue growth and controllable expenses across base salaries as well as G&A. Ultimately, I think with the long growth of markets is our structural tailwind, that's going to deliver more beta to the bottom line in op income growth and the benefits of scale to our clients and shareholders.

As I mentioned on my prepared remarks, after annualizing for the impact of HPS and Preqin, we'd expect a mid-single-digit percentage increase in G&A. In 2025, we didn't see the full year impact of acquired HPS and Preqin G&A, so it will impact the year-over-year comparison in 2026. If you annualize our second half 2025 G&A results, which fully captures HPS and Preqin G&A, our 2026 expected G&A growth is in the mid-single digits. Once we've lapped the 2026 results with a full year of integrated expense in our results, we expect you'll continue to see controllable expenses within organic base fee growth as we drive our 2030 strategy forward. That implies future years are in the mid-single-digit percentage growth.

Your next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan.

Kenneth Worthington
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I wanted to dig a little bit further into Preqin. The alternative data business is evolving. Several alternative managers and index companies have launched private market partnerships over the last few quarters with plans to launch various private market indices. How should we view the evolution of Preqin and BlackRock's initiatives around private market data? And what sort of outlook do you see for Preqin and BlackRock to participate in investable alternative indices?

Martin Small
Senior MD, CFO & Global Head of Corporate Strategy

Thanks. I'd start with, we're basically 9 months plus past the close of Preqin. The integration has really been terrific. We're very excited about the plans going forward. The 4 big things to do as part of bringing Preqin into BlackRock is, first, expanding the distribution, obviously, of world-class Preqin data across our client base. The second is the build-out of data and models for private markets using the Preqin data, creating that great ecosystem where you have data and models being able to power how asset allocators think about investing in the private markets, how they think about benchmarking and comparing returns, effectively creating the language of private markets, both in risk models and in data. The third is enriching the data and building scale in the data factory.

And then the fourth is the opportunity you're touching on, which we think is the larger long-term opportunity of leveraging our engines in Aladdin and iShares to build the machine for the indexing of the private markets. And when I think about what the creation of public markets did to drive stock markets, which especially we see through iShares, we think BlackRock and Preqin to do that for the private markets. We see that opportunity as being particularly compelling. We're working on building investable indices that we hope to bring to market here in the next few years.

And I think the real opportunity is to try to standardize index rules, to try to standardize pricing frameworks and ultimately publication so that you can create markets and transparency that ultimately can power futures contracts, can ultimately power iShares. And that's a big part of our strategy in the overall growth of Preqin.

Laurence Fink
Founder, CEO & Chairman

Let me add one other point. Because more and more insurance companies, more and more pension funds and sovereign funds are deploying more and more private market strategies and more wealth managers are anticipating more private market strategies, the need to have a comprehensive risk management platform is even more imperative. So having a separate risk management system only for private markets is not going to be workable. And I think what Aladdin is bringing across the world or the spectrum of public and private markets, we're in a position of very large growth. And you saw that in our ACV growth in 2025. And we expect that to continue over the coming years. The need to have a comprehensive risk platform.

And especially if the Department of Labor approves the utilization of private markets in the 401(k), in the defined contribution business, each and every firm is going to have to validate and authenticate the risk that is being implied when they add private markets. We are still going to have to live under some prudent ruling, maybe still a fiduciary ruling of some sort, we don't know. But I can say with absolute certainty, the need to have a comprehensive risk tools to understand the risk associated with adding private markets to a -- what is -- all public market portfolio is imperative. And so the need for a platform like Aladdin has never been greater, especially with the addition of private markets in the defined contribution space.

Your next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.

Daniel Fannon
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

So just a question on private credit. I was hoping you could first disclose what the HPS flows were in the quarter. And then more broadly, how you're thinking about the outlook for growth given the headlines and news flow around this asset class. Has that changed at all as we think about 2026 and beyond?

Martin Small
Senior MD, CFO & Global Head of Corporate Strategy

Thanks a lot. So we deployed $25 billion in 2025 across private markets, led by private credit and infrastructure. The deployment trends have been strong. We had $7 billion of private credit net inflows in the quarter, primarily due to deployment activity. We're seeing good and building momentum for private markets investing and private credit, I think, particularly. So that number, I think, is in the tables. We're generally seeing stable credit conditions across the main HPS strategies that today form the core of our private credit platform. We think some of the headlines that we've read often highlight isolated stress points rather than painting the full picture. But we generally see stable credit conditions across the portfolios that we're managing. But I think the context is critical, like defaults and losses in the non-IG direct lending to corporates have been abnormally low for years following low rates.

Default rates in the broader leveraged loan market are averaging slightly below the long-term average of 3%. And in economic slowdowns, like default rates rose to 4% to 5%, the all-time peak in the GFC hit 15% on an issuer weighted basis. And so direct lending defaults are rising but they remain in historical ranges. So I think we see this period, as do many of the other firms, as a period of expected catch-up following a long period of very low defaults. So returning to normal defaults is something I think we expect. When we look through the universe of BDC loans, the $400 billion across 20,000 loans sitting in the valuation databases, we see nonaccruals that are inside the historical average. We see PIK as a percentage of total interest income in line with historical norms, recovery rates that are in line with historical norms. The data does show some stratification between smaller companies and larger companies.

So a $0 to $50 million EBITDA company looks very different than a $100 million to $200 million EBITDA company in terms of the ability to generate earnings. So I think going forward, it's not that there's nothing to see here. It's just that we'd expect smaller borrowers, particularly those that were financed at very high or peak valuations and capital structures that didn't contemplate a 3% to 4% neutral rate, those are the credits that we'd expect to be more challenged. The HPS teams have focused very consistently over the years on larger companies. The weighted average EBITDA on the HLEND portfolio is about $250 million. But these are lending businesses. There will be normalized default rates through cycles. And I think the team is very fond of saying the promise of private credit is not that there will be no defaults, it's that detailed credit work is going to be rewarded and that lenders will be in a better position to maximize recoveries.

We continue to see good flows. We had strong gross subscriptions of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter in HLEND. Redemptions were 4.1%, which was higher than recent quarters but in line with the broader industry. I think a mix of factors affected the Q4 flows. There's generally elevated seasonal redemptions. There was media attention, some profit taking. And then I think forward expectations on lower base rates also plays in. But still, most BDCs posted positive flows. In our Preqin survey data, we see the structural pipeline for private credit fundraising and deployment as intact. In the Preqin data, over 80% of investors plan to maintain or increase their allocations to private credit in the next 12 months. It's just becoming a more standard part of overall fixed income allocations to provide income and diversification.

Your next question comes from Ben Budish with Barclays.

Benjamin Budish
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Maybe just following up on Dan's question. Just curious if you could provide a little bit more color on your expectations for the wealth channel more generally in 2026. HLEND, obviously, some good, if not better than average trends in Q4. What's the latest you're hearing from advisers? For GIP, I know there was some press indicating that there were maybe some challenges getting a product off the ground. So just curious if there's anything you can share there. And then I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about model portfolios using private markets. So anything you can share in terms of what those products might look like, what we should expect in terms of timing would be helpful.

Martin Small
Senior MD, CFO & Global Head of Corporate Strategy

Sure. I'll give that one a go. I'd start with the framing that, again, at our Investor Day, we discussed how our platform was going to target $400 billion in gross fundraising from 2025 through 2030. We raised over $40 billion in private markets in 2025. And we're entering '26, I think, with strong momentum, very excited about the integrated public private capabilities that now include GIP, HPS and Preqin. In private wealth and retail channels, we currently have the flagship private credit BDC HLEND, as you mentioned, been raising about $1 billion a quarter. And we have semi-liquid strategies in senior secured loans, junior capital and broadly syndicated loans. In '40 Act interval and tender offer funds, we have multi-strategy credit and private equity solutions that combine for about $1 billion in AUM under the tickers CREDX and BPIF.

And in Europe, we recently launched multi-alternative solutions products using the LTIP vehicles, which stand at sort of $600 million plus in AUM, generally offered through private banks and retirement plans. Looking ahead, as Larry mentioned, we're bringing an H Series of vehicles to the market for private wealth and retail channels over the course of '26. The H Series is going to give investors access to key private markets building blocks, direct lending, junior capital, real assets, triple net lease, private equity solutions. And at our Investor Day, we set out a goal to grow the private markets to wealth series of products to at least $60 billion of AUM by 2030. So I think you'll see here in the near term, a real asset strategy coming to market in the U.S., European direct lending to European private wealth clients and following with triple net lease and other strategies in the U.S. later this year.
