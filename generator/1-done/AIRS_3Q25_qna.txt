Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joshua Raskin of Nephron Research.

Marco Criscuolo
Nephron Research LLC

This is actually Marco on for Josh. So cost controls actually looked pretty strong relative to our estimates for the quarter. So I was just wondering if you could go a little deeper on the cost-cutting measures you have taken by line, whether it be G&A or cost of service. And then looking forward, how should we think about the sustainability of the savings you're generating? Should we expect those to continue into the fourth quarter and into next year as well?

Dennis Dean
Chief Financial Officer

Marco, it's Dennis. Thanks for the question. Yes, a lot of our cost controls, as we had kind of communicated over the past couple of quarters, has focused primarily in the SG&A realm. There are some things that we've done within the cost of services. But primarily, it's been in our SG&A and our support that we've had at regional positions and things of that nature. So that's been primarily the focus on it. We're continuing to heavily focus on that. Clearly, as we kind of guided our number into the fourth quarter, even though we are experiencing some -- the revenue softness, the cost controls are really kind of helping bridge some of that gap for us. So really pleased with that. We keep uncovering things as we kind of push on various vendors and those sorts of things and are identifying additional opportunities. So we expect to continue on this approach being diligent but most of that was in the SG&A line.

Great. That's helpful. And if I could just squeeze one more in. It was good to hear about the progress you're seeing with the stand-alone skin tightening service. But could you just go into a little more detail on what you're seeing there in terms of uptake and how you envision the pace at which that's expanded across the rest of the centers? And then also, if you could just go a little deeper on what new services you're looking to add to address that GLP-1 population.

Yogesh Jashnani
CEO & Director

Marco, this is Yogi. Thanks for the question. As it relates to skin tightening, our thesis is proving out in that we are seeing there's demand for solutions that address loose skin. Now what we are also seeing is that the pool of qualified candidates for stand-alone skin tightening was smaller than we anticipated, mainly because the loose skin was beyond what skin tightening could address. So while that meant Q3 revenue was muted, we see this as a broader and more enduring opportunity for a suite of procedures to further address additional loose skin. That comes in the form of skin excisions or skin removals, for example. And many of those can be done in our clinics under local.

It fits within our model pretty perfectly. So we have started to pilot some of that already. Skin tightening has been expanded to multiple centers. Skin excisions is in pilot right now. And even without marketing it, we are starting to see good demand for that. So we will continue to expand on that. Just as a quick reminder, for all of these procedures, it takes 3 to 6 months for patients to see full results. And so while we are starting off on these, it will take us a few months to get the before and afters and then turn those around into marketing and expand it from there.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Sam Eiber of BTIG.

Maybe I can start on a Q3 question and then I definitely want to come back to the GLP-1 opportunity. But Yogi, you talked about a timing issue this quarter. Would love, I guess, your thoughts on exactly maybe what happened here. I know last quarter, leads and consultations were stepping up a bit. So I would just love to better understand the timing issue in Q3.

Yogesh Jashnani
CEO & Director

Yes. All right. Sam, thank you for the question. So for Q3, we continue to operate in a challenging consumer environment, especially for considered purchases. That hasn't changed since Q2. While we saw leads and consults continue to remain strong, they were strong in Q2 and they continue to remain strong in Q3. We continue to see that consumers are hesitant to go from, I'm interested, I want to talk to you guys, I want to get a quote, to purchasing. However, we are seeing Q4 same-store sales trends are better than year-to-date. And as we are transforming the business, we realized there is a bigger opportunity with GLP-1 users than we initially thought.

We initially thought skin tightening would be able to address a broader sliver but we are seeing that the demand is bigger and the needs are broader, which we can address. And we are already starting to see that GLP-1 users are converting better than non-GLP-1 users. So the strategic play is with introducing the new procedures, adapting our marketing and sales to capitalize on that. So in summary, while short-term revenue is lower than expected, we are excited about the broader GLP opportunity in front of us.

Sam Eiber
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Okay. That makes sense. Very helpful, Yogi. All right. Maybe coming to the GLP-1 opportunity. I would love to, I guess, better understand surgeon interest in the skin excision opportunity within AirSculpt centers, right, their ability to capture maybe some of the economics for these procedures among these patients. And then maybe as a follow-up to that, how you're thinking about any shifts in marketing or brand awareness for AirSculpt to go after this opportunity? Does that need to change at all as you kind of go after this new subsegment of patients?

Yogesh Jashnani
CEO & Director

Sam, I'll address both parts of that question. As it relates to surgeon interest and expertise, I think you were asking about both, if I understood your question correctly. Look, there is -- both are actually a pretty strong positive for us. I had to -- at a couple of points, slow things down and make sure that we are doing a pilot in fewer locations than where I had surgeon interest. So surgeon base is definitely interested in doing skin excisions and that is evident in our pilot as well. And surgeons are more than capable -- we have an elite network of over 80 surgeons, plastic and cosmetic, who provide excellent care. And many of them have the abilities and have been doing this in their -- whether it's in their private practice or in their past lives as well.

So no concerns from that perspective. Now there will be -- to your other question, there will be changes in marketing and sales. It is much more about making sure that we get the messaging right to people who are GLP-1 users or who have loose skin. So that's where we are testing into what is the right messaging, what is the right targeting and what is the right place in the cycle of GLP-1 use that people are looking for loose skin as a problem. Remember, we've been talking about loose skin and also fat removal is another big idea here because with GLP-1, there is uneven weight loss and uneven volume loss. So we continue to see people coming in for removing those stubborn fat deposits that GLP-1 was unable to address as well.

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the Q&A session. I will now hand back to Yogi Jashnani for closing remarks.

Yogesh Jashnani
CEO & Director

Thank you again for joining us. I also want to thank the AirSculpt team and our network of over 80 surgeons that provide excellent care and results to our patients. Together, we are powering the next chapter in AirSculpt's growth. We look forward to share our progress when we report Q4 results and wish you a happy and healthy holiday season.

Operator

Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's event. Thank you for attending and you may now disconnect your line.
