Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Ben Sommers from BTIG.

So kind of on the W56 step van and kind of being eligible for those state-level incentives in California, kind of curious just more broader market outlook. How you're seeing state-level incentives across the U.S. kind of panning out in different states and what you think the opportunities are beyond California for the step van?

Richard Dauch
President, CEO & Director

Great question. So we are -- we worked with the CAR group and a couple of other people in the EV space to make sure the HVIP vouchers are competitive. Out in California, that was successful, and we saw immediate pickup in orders from the FedEx ground guys out there. And right now, we're -- but every truck we're building between now and the year has already got a purchase order and HVIP voucher tied to it.

We are seeing some good movement in the state of Washington and the State of New York in terms of vouchers, and we have turned our efforts to those 2 areas, those 2 states for sure. So -- and then I'd like to say, too, is that we talked about having our truck down the last 3 years at the FedEx conference for the ground operators. We have one site in California now that's operating more than 20 W56 step vans. Once we get a truck in the hands of a ground operator and they see the reliability of our truck averaging 97%, 98% uptime, we're seeing repeat orders from multiple FedEx ground operators.

Awesome. And then just kind of curious on costs as we ramp closer towards production of this vehicle, how should we be thinking about that trending in '26 as we get prepared for the production launch there?

Richard Dauch
President, CEO & Director

I'm going to ask Bob to answer that question.

Robert Ginnan
Chief Financial Officer

Okay. So I think if you look at the costs from 2 elements, there's obviously the bill of material cost, which we continue to focus on bringing that down through engineering and supply chain. But also as we -- as the production increases, you'll see an improvement in the labor cost as we get into a regular cadence on the lines there. So we look to see improvements in both areas as we go forward.

Richard Dauch
President, CEO & Director

Yes, and we're starting to see -- obviously, we haven't had a lot of volume so far. And so to get the manufacturing right, we built 3 or 4 trucks now perfectly. We had no post-production touch-ups and some of that. So our guys are starting to get a handle on how to build the chassis and more importantly, the cabin body. That's a pretty complex assembly operation there.

We also have de-escalators in our purchase contracts when we hit certain volumes down the road. We're far from those volumes now, but they're built into the contracts, and that will lower the bill of material costs. We know we have to move closer and closer to be almost on parity with ICE. That's going to take a couple of years, and it's going to require us to get to certain levels of volume, especially on batteries to lower the cost.

Yes, one thing I'd say, too, is that once we do get trucks in the field, based on the data we're having right now, both at FedEx and Ground, we're seeing somewhere between a 55% to 65% total cost of operation reduction. No fuel costs, obviously, new trucks, very -- no spare parts and uptime, again, 98%. So we think that's a good selling point when we're out there talking to fleets.

We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Rick for any further closing comments.

Richard Dauch
President, CEO & Director

Appreciate your patience with us. It's been a tough 4 years in the electric vehicle transition market. Those things we can control, we're doing our best to do that. And we think the merger with Motiv gives us even a bigger opportunity to lower the operating cost of the company, expand the product portfolio, give us a better opportunity to be successful long term, and we think it's the right thing for shareholders. We appreciate your support, and have a great day. Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

Richard Dauch
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Kevin.

Take care, everyone.
