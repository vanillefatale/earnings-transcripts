Our first question will come from Saket Kalia with Barclays.

Saket Kalia
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Barbara, congrats on your next phase.

Barbara Larson
CFO & Principal Financial Officer

Thanks, Saket.

Saket Kalia
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Tomer, maybe for you, it's great to hear that half of the bookings are now coming from outside Endpoint. Can you just maybe talk about which products outside of Endpoint are kind of becoming the most material from a new business perspective? And to what extent is Flex enabling that?

Tomer Weingarten
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Of course. Thanks for the question. First and foremost, Data Solutions. That accelerated for us to triple-digit year-over-year growth with both new customers and existing customer expansion. So a lot of momentum in kind of the SIEM replacement space. And obviously, with the acquisition of Observo, this will continue and remove the friction in these transitions and allow us to onboard more and more data into our Data Analytics platform.

The second contributor is Purple AI. With no surprise, it's about 40% attached, which is a new record for us. And this is only for the base capability. That really validates our applied AI approach baked in directly into every part of the platform, and that we believe, delivers true customer value and efficiency gains. And obviously, when you think about Flex, that is what's allowing these customers now to have the freedom to consume every part of the SentinelOne platform. So that is also a catalyst, and we're seeing that come up online for us in a pretty nice way. So as the platform goes wider, Flex enables that consumption across the board. And we believe that these are going to be the modules for us, are going to carry growth for years to come.

Our next question will come from John DiFucci with Guggenheim.

John DiFucci
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Listen, team, this looks like a good strong quarter here, and it's really nice to see that free cash flow. But guide was just a little lighter than we were looking for, and I think the Street was looking for. Is there anything to read into that? I only half-jokingly ask whether it's because Barry is going to be less focused on growth next quarter in his new role. And I just kind of trying to figure that out. And I guess, Barbara, we'll miss you here. And it's -- SentinelOne has become pretty consistent here since you've been there, and I think people are starting to understand the way your cadence has worked out here. But is there anything other than an opportunity outside of cyber that you can say?

Barbara Larson
CFO & Principal Financial Officer

Yes. Well, let me first cover the guidance, which I think you're specifically talking about the revenue outlook. So Q4 revenue outlook reflects steady momentum in the business. It's supported by a healthy pipeline, continued momentum with customers and partners and growing contributions from our emerging products. As you know, Q4 is seasonally the largest quarter of the year. So things like deal timing, in-quarter linearity can influence quarterly revenue. We believe that's a prudent approach to take given that the macro environment continues to be dynamic.

And then just zooming out from a full year perspective, our FY '26 revenue guidance implies an improvement of $1 million compared to the midpoint of our prior guidance. Again, steady execution and business momentum.

And then on your second question, this is just really a personal decision for me. You can't always time opportunities, but it was an opportunity for me that comes in a space that I'm deeply passionate about. Helping SentinelOne surpass $1 billion in ARR, reach non-GAAP profitability has been a really important milestone for me personally. I just want to be clear, that decision is entirely independent of SentinelOne's outlook. We've built a really strong foundation, achieve profitability, have solid momentum. That's clear by our Q3 outperformance and outlook for FY '26. And I'll just say, I care deeply about the SentinelOne team, which is why I'm committed to staying through mid-January and help Barry and the team with a seamless handover. So thanks for the questions, John.

Your next question will come from Brian Essex with JPMorgan.

Brian Essex
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Barbara, congratulations from me as well. I guess maybe to piggyback on John's question, could we -- could you touch on gross margin? And it looks like the guide calls for a little bit of sequential gross margin compression. Just would love to get your puts and takes on the drivers of that, what you see in the pricing environment and maybe with the longer-term outlook, how that may or may not have changed after what you've seen this quarter?

Barbara Larson
CFO & Principal Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks for the question. So Q3, we delivered industry-leading gross margins of 79%. We expect to sustain gross margin at the high 70s level. In terms of the puts and takes, our Q4 guide includes strategic investments in cloud infrastructure and capacity expansion. This is really just a reflection of growing global scale and platform diversification. For example, just this week, we announced that Singularity platform is now GA on Google Cloud in Saudi Arabia. So you can see the traction we're having in international markets.

Operator

Your next question will come from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.

Nasr Islam
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

This is Nasr Islam, on for Brad Zelnick. Gentlemen, nice quarter on both the new business and the margin front. As you evaluate the breadth of products in the Singularity platform, do you see the need to add further functionality perhaps through further M&A? And relatedly, what are the guardrails for M&A as you balance growth and profitability?

Tomer Weingarten
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

We believe we have a pretty complete platform. I think if you kind of look at the sum total of all the capabilities we have, it's incredibly competitive in the market. There aren't many platform providers that have the breadth and depth of capabilities that we have. We made these 2 acquisitions in areas that we believe are incredibly strategic, not only for now, but also for the future opportunity in cybersecurity. So as we look at our platform capability set today, we don't envision any big missing pieces. We're always going to remain opportunistic.

But at the same time, we've not changed our philosophy around M&A. And we have a substantial part of our platform built in-house. We're going to continue and invest in innovation in-house. And in the areas where we believe there's both opportunity and a strategic gap, we might opt to acquire. But again, nothing impending, and we believe our platform is incredibly competitive at this point.

Operator

Your next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.

Meta Marshall
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. Maybe just in terms of -- you kind of noted improvement in execution and just kind of traction with the Flex deals. Just wondering if you could kind of give more details in terms of where you're seeing kind of that strength and -- with both Flex and with kind of improved execution?

Tomer Weingarten
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. Definitely steady execution, a lot of platform momentum. Our teams executed above our expectations. And I think what's also clear is that our Technology Advantage is resonating. And at the same time, we're still making tangible progress in building stronger sales and marketing engines. But the last 2 quarters really reflect a steady improvement in execution and meaningful progress along that journey.

Second one, Flex, there's just a lot of momentum as customers adopt the Singularity platform in a more dynamic fashion. And it's still early for us, but Flex is already helping us secure larger multi-solution deals and longer-term customer commitments. I think you see some of that through acceleration of RPO as an example. The target is obviously to do more and more larger deals. You can also see that through a record ARR per customer contribution. So the more dynamic licensing capabilities we give to our customers, the more they're able to consume from the platform. So it's enabling our teams to land bigger and with higher efficiency for us.

To us, strategically, Flex, again, opens the door for customers to experiment and try more of our platform, and we're seeing that translate into more and more business for us. When you think about these acquisitions that we've done, when you think about the new capabilities that we bring online, Flex allows customers to immediately consume them as well. So it bodes well for our entire go-to-market motion.

The next question will come from Joseph Gallo with Jefferies.

Joseph Gallo
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

It was great to see the net new ARR growth in the past 2 quarters. Just any commentary on 4Q? And then given you're investing so much in capacity, you're clearly confident on the future. Can we expect net new ARR growth to grow again next year? Or how should we think about the glide path of growth into next year?

Barbara Larson
CFO & Principal Financial Officer

Joe, thanks for the question. So while we don't provide formal ARR guidance, for Q4, we do expect net new ARR to be higher sequentially, which would be consistent with what we've seen historically from a seasonality perspective.

Operator

Your next question will come from Fatima Boolani with Citi.

Fatima Boolani
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Barbara, congratulations on your next adventure.

I wanted to drill in on the net new ARR performance. So that 1% growth, can you unpack sort of the puts and takes there? And Barbara, maybe if you can help marry that with some of your commentary in the prepared script around net retention rates well into the expansion territory. I'm just sort of trying to reconcile the RPO and bookings strength versus maybe a little bit more on the net new ARR side?

Barbara Larson
CFO & Principal Financial Officer

Thanks for the question. So Q3 net new ARR remains solid. We saw healthy contributions from new customer wins, expansion with existing customers. We also saw record ARR per customer. Really, that's driven by continued adoption of our emerging solutions: AI, Data, Cloud. So continuing to innovate and execute and this quarter is an evidence that our Land and Expand strategy is working well given the momentum we're seeing across our emerging products. And from an NRR perspective, yes, remains in expansionary territory and relatively stable with what we've seen the past few quarters.

Operator

The next question will come from Eric Heath with KeyBanc.

Eric Heath
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Barbara, you mentioned the guide takes some considerations like deal timing and linearity into effect when we talking about Q4. I'm just curious like thus far through the month of November, if linearity was a little bit slower than maybe anticipated. And -- and maybe if there's -- the sales cycles that are possibly getting longer as you introduce Flex deals that are bigger and more strategic in nature?

Barbara Larson
CFO & Principal Financial Officer

Yes. I mean I would just comment on 2 factors that I discussed last quarter that are still relevant to Q4. In-quarter linearity is one of them. We expect it to be a back-end loaded quarter, especially given the U.S. holidays in November and December and then also lower than initially anticipated Services contribution. So as a reminder, Services contributes to revenue, but not to ARR.

Operator

The next question will come from Jonathan Ho with William Blair.

Jonathan Ho
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

I just wanted to see if you could give us a little bit of a sense of where we are in terms of AI security adoption and maybe where customers are in terms of that maturity curve for adopting some of these new solutions. It sounds like you've had tremendous success. And I just wanted to see maybe what inning we're in, in terms of analogies? Congrats, Barbara.

Barbara Larson
CFO & Principal Financial Officer

Thank you.

Tomer Weingarten
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I mean, obviously, to us, AI security is now centered around Prompt Security. The response from customers and partners has just been incredible. It addresses obviously an urgent and growing need. Every organization adopting AI tools and every CISO we engage with is just focused on doing it in the most safe way possible. The use of generative AI and agentic tools is accelerating as anybody can see and everybody can see. And customers are obviously looking for real-time visibility, governance and controls as they deploy AI workloads.

So we're seeing healthy early traction in the field. The sales motion for Prompt aligns very naturally with our existing go-to-market framework. It's a great augmentation to our Endpoint footprint, into our AI footprint with Purple. So it's both a great cross-sell opportunity amongst existing customers and an entry point for new customers looking to secure AI usage and the technologies that they onboard. So all in all, really great traction right now. Pipeline looks promising. And all in all, as you can imagine, everybody is looking for ways to deploy AI workloads responsibly and Prompt is just a great answer for that.

The next question will come from Shaul Eyal with TD Cowen.

Shaul Eyal
TD Cowen, Research Division

Tomer, what actions are you taking internally to accelerate net new ARR performance? Maybe how do you guys think about hiring into the new fiscal year? Congrats, Barbara.

Tomer Weingarten
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I think a lot of what we just discussed. I mean, SentinelOne's Flex is allowing us to just drive with more efficiency, customer expansions. Obviously, continuously investing in the acquired assets is another strategy for us where we continue to scale these businesses as we integrate them.

The other, I think, action that is allowing this is also a very rapid integration into our existing platform capabilities. So all of those just result, I think, in more strategic conversations with customers. It's not just about selling AI security or an AI data pipeline. It repositions our entire platform and create more and more competitive differentiation where we're able to come in and fully deliver end-to-end security, fully deliver end-to-end data onboarding, data ingestion, data retention in one solution and one unified platform. So as we think about net new ARR, that's obviously the #1 imperative, which is land bigger and expand bigger. And now we have the capability set and the outcomes to deliver to customers.

The next question will come from Mike Cikos with Needham.

Michael Cikos
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Congrats on the quarter and best of luck to you, Barbara. I just wanted to sanity check some of the commentary here and appreciate the consistent messaging on what you guys are communicating on macro. But it would be helpful at the margin to hear with respect to deal timing, macro sales cycles, how did that play out in Q3 versus your expectations? And then to the degree you can elaborate, how is public sector? I know it's a relatively small part of your business, but if that in any way impacted how you were thinking about the guidance here as well?

Tomer Weingarten
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

I think that in terms of deal timing, I'm just going to echo what Barbara said. The environment, as you can see throughout this entire earnings cycle is a bit unpredictable. So for us, we felt really the most prudent to solve for that, so to speak. With that, we feel very confident in our ability to execute against our Q4 guide. So all in all, we are just trying to create a more measured approach to what we see out there in terms of deal timing.

Barbara mentioned Q4 is our biggest quarter. So there's a lot of business coming in, linearity can change $1 million here or $1 million there, which is the entire gamut of this adjustment. So again, all in all, these are the factors that we're taking into play here as we continue and execute through the year. And obviously, as you can see for the full year guidance, we have taken our guidance up.

With regards to federal business, Q3 was in line with our expectations. Overall, we remain mindful that federal opportunities often progress at a slower pace due to procurement cycle and budget dynamics. But at the same time, our engagement in the federal vertical remained very strong with positive demand signals and alignment across our FedRAMP High offerings, which spend all the way from our endpoint solutions and through data and AI. Just this quarter, as we mentioned, we had a meaningful expansion with an existing customer, and we're building durable relationships, advancing the opportunities and solidifying SentinelOne's position as a trusted long-term partner across the entire federal ecosystem.

The next question will come from Shrenik Kothari at Baird.

Zachary Schneider
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

This is Zach Schneider, on for Shrenik. So you noted the minimal revenue and ARR contribution from Observo next year. But just more from a high level, previously, you've talked on how it unlocks a multi-hundred million dollar ARR opportunity by really eliminating third-party telemetry dependencies. So I'd just curious to hear sort of what benefits have you seen since the acquisition and just tactically how you're positioning Observo versus private vendors and some platform peers in competitive bake-offs?

Tomer Weingarten
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

This goes back to my commentary around giving a complete end-to-end out-of-the-box functionality. Not only Observo brings advanced capabilities to ingest data, it's not just another data pipeline, it's a complete AI native data pipeline, which just the pace of onboarding, the level of ease of use that we can provide is already above and beyond everything else in the space. And when you couple that with the ultrafast data lake we have, you kind of arrive in a world where we have the complete data suite from data pipelines and ingestion to data lake and search and data orchestration and hyperautomation.

So think about SentinelOne and AI SIEM and our data solutions as a complete one-stop shop to transition away from your olden legacy SOC provider and SIEM provider and into an ultrafast quick-to-deploy type of a solution that's fully AI-enabled. And obviously, if you then take into consideration the amount of automation that we can bring into the picture given that we control that real-time streaming element and the data ingestion pipeline, then you start to understand the art of the possible with deploying more and more agentic-based capability to automate more and more of the tasks in cybersecurity, which obviously has been our vision for quite a while now, and that marriage of data ingestion, data processing and data orchestration really starts to produce this vision of the complete autonomous cybersecurity platform, which is where we're going.

The next question will come from Adam Tindle with RJF.

Adam Tindle
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

And best wishes to Barbara. Tomer, I wanted to just mention, you talked about the partner ecosystem. And just to be very blunt, a competitor called out a pretty big displacement on their earnings call just earlier this week, and that was a partner that you had ramped just earlier this year. They're indicating that there's more to come after this. Just wanted to sort of give you a forum to respond to some of that comments on defending that and the notion of more displacements to come? And if you could tie that into how you're thinking about forward growth from here, the ability to maintain this 20% growth, which you're guiding to in Q4? That would be helpful.

Tomer Weingarten
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. I think you're going to have to talk to them. I mean we still have quite a lot of licenses going with all of our partners. And at the same time, this quarter, specifically, we doubled down in a very significant way with 2 of our biggest partners with multiyear commitments. So we have not seen any meaningful disruption from whatever competitor that is. Our partner ecosystem is incredibly robust. I mean we have a lot of partners globally. So I don't know exactly what they were talking about. But at the same time, all I see is growth from our partners set as a whole.

As for the next year, I think you can look at our Q4 exit rate as a good indicator. All in all, we have a ton of momentum in the business. At the same time, we're trying to balance the macroeconomic environment and how unpredictable and at times volatile it can be. But all in all, we have a lot of confidence in the momentum we're seeing right now in the traction we're seeing with our solutions. And I think more than anything, the customer reception and how well our solutions resonate versus everything else out there just gives us a lot of hope that this is the right solution at the right time and just a great market fit.

The next question will come from Joshua Tilton with Wolfe Research.

Joshua Tilton
Wolfe Research, LLC

Hey guys, can you hear me?

Barbara Larson
CFO & Principal Financial Officer

We can hear you, Josh.

Joshua Tilton
Wolfe Research, LLC

Awesome. Barbara -- actually, maybe this one is for Tomer. I guess my question is, there's been a lot of talk and a lot of focus and rightfully so about -- I don't know if it's been more focus on the bottom line or just an emphasis on delivering operating cash flow, free cash flow, just more of a conversation around profitability this year. And I know it's only in the interim while you guys conduct a search, but I can't help but notice that you're kind of choosing to replace the CFO that seems to have led this profitability motion with someone whose title is Growth or Growth Officer. And my question, I guess, is just like as we go into next year, is there anything you're trying to signal around a change in focus between how you think between growth and profitability this year versus next year? Or am I just kind of reading too much into a title?

Tomer Weingarten
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

You're absolutely reading too much into it. I don't think there was any intent to signal anything and we'll continue down the same path that we've been executing towards in the past couple of years. I mean, you're seeing us consistently expand operating margin year-over-year, and that's going to continue into next year as well. We're striving to achieve the Rule of 40 as fast as we can, basically. And that is just the way that we look at expansion. And we believe there's obviously more operating leverage in the business that we'll continue to extract.

The next question will come from Patrick Colville with Scotiabank.

Patrick Edwin Colville
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Tomer, I guess my question is for you, please. when I look at the metric around the proportion of quarterly bookings from emerging products, it's kind of interesting to me that it stayed consistent around 50%. And so I guess that could mean 2 things. It could mean that the core endpoint has like continued to surprise to the upside, and there's still like a decent amount of Trellix, McAfee, et cetera, to go after or it could be that these emerging products have maybe been a bit disappointing versus what we might have hoped. So I guess, could you just unpack that metric? And like what is going on behind the scenes and maybe with a lens towards next year, like what should we expect next year there?

Tomer Weingarten
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. I'd say, I mean, to us, it looks like a very balanced contribution. We like it where we are. There is definite potential and continued expansion in the core endpoint space, and we definitely don't want to wave that away. I just mentioned we doubled down with 2 of our biggest endpoint partners. So that obviously shows you that there's more to go after in that core endpoint space. And obviously, we're having a lot of success there. We have one of the best products in this space.

But then obviously, a lot of our data solutions, which are highly pertinent both for existing customers, but also as we land in competitive state, those are strategic to us as well. So we kind of feel like the 50-50 contribution is a good place for us to be as we continue to execute both on the core endpoint opportunity and starting to extract more and more meaningful revenue from data analytics and from AI. We're also adding more and more capabilities to our Endpoint suite. So it's not only about EDR, creating adjacent capabilities to continue and expand in that core footprint. So all in all, we got multiple growth vectors as we go into next year.

Operator

We have no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back to Tomer Weingarten for closing remarks.

Tomer Weingarten
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you all. Our third quarter results show the solid execution and progress we're making as we scale the business. Customers are increasingly turning to SentinelOne for better security outcomes and value, and we're focused on driving durable growth, expanding margins and continuing to deliver the industry's leading AI-powered security. Again, thank you all for joining us today.
