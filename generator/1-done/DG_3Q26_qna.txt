Our first question is coming from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer.

Rupesh Parikh
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Welcome back, Donny. So I have a 2-part question just on gross margin. So for Q4, it would be helpful to understand some of the puts and takes there you see on the gross margin line. And then from a longer-term perspective, we've seen significant progress this year on the gross margin front, including shrink. Just curious about your overall confidence in being able to deliver the next round of improvement, whether it's from retail media, mix shifts, et cetera, and on the damages front.

Donny Lau
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Maybe I'll kick it off and then hand off the second part of your question to Todd. But thanks, Rupesh. Good to connect with you again. Maybe I'll just start with the Q3 gross margin. I'm especially pleased, right, that we delivered 107 basis points of expansion in Q3, and that's on top of 137 basis points in Q2. And from a Q3 perspective, that's also despite 79 basis points headwind from LIFO. And so while we're very pleased to see continued benefit from some of our other key focus areas like lower damages, reduction in markdowns and some of the other initiatives that Todd is going to speak about, I think the outperformance and shrink was notable during the quarter. And so the way I think about it, Rupesh, is we're really building momentum on our key initiatives, and the team is really doing a nice job in terms of balancing price and managing mix.

In terms of Q4, we do expect another quarter of gross margin expansion in Q4. We expect to see continued improvement in shrink, as I was alluded to on the prepared remarks, to a lesser extent versus Q3. And that's because we really are lapping outsized or more improvement in Q4 of 2024 to the tune of about 68 basis points. We'll also be lapping a discrete item in the prior year really associated with the optimization of our portfolio. And we also expect continued benefit from growth in private label and non-consumables and continued improvement in damages as well as supply chain efficiencies.

The one headwind I will note is just LIFO, although we do expect to partially offset that with pricing and through continued managing mix as well. And so again, overall, on the gross margin line, I'd say, I believe there's more tailwinds than headwinds, which is nice to see and feel really good about the momentum we're seeing and building on this front.

Todd Vasos
CEO & Director

Yes, Rupesh, thanks for the question as well. As I think about the long-term gross margin opportunities, feel very good. Actually, shrink is -- our shrink improvement so far has actually given us, myself and our team here, even more confidence in delivering on that long-term model in our gross -- on our gross margin line. If you think about it, when I think about where we're at today with shrink, as Donny indicated, the great thing about our shrink benefit so far is while we did take self-checkout out, which has been a nice contributor, the stores that never had self-checkout, about 6,500 of them have seen very substantial increases or I should say, decreases in shrink and increases in gross margin. So what that does, it gives us a lot of confidence that there's probably more gross margin opportunities than we even thought in that long-term model. So stay tuned for that as we go forward.

And then as Donny indicated, boy, we still have a lot of great opportunities ahead. When you think of damages, we're just starting that journey. We've seen some nice damage clawbacks over the last couple of quarters, but we see even more without giving you any guidance for '26 yet, even more as we move into next year and beyond. So stay tuned there. I think you'll see us execute against that very similarly how we executed very strong against our shrink initiatives.

And then lastly, mix and media network. Mix continues to be a good guy and will continue to be. All of the work the team has done, the merchants, our operators, our supply chain on our non-consumable initiatives really has moved the mix number for us. And as you know, those hold a lot stronger gross margins, not only in our home, seasonal and apparel categories, but also our HBA categories, which have outsized gross margin. So we feel very good about the long-term prospects of that.

And then lastly, our media network, we're in the second inning. We're just starting the media network piece. And I would tell you that we're off to a great start, double-digit increases again this quarter. And as I look out to the long-term model, we see a lot of opportunity there as well. So stay tuned. We feel strong. We feel good about where we are and very good about that long-term model.

Next question is coming from Zhihan Ma from Bernstein.

Zhihan Ma
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

I have a 2-part one on real estate. So a short-term one, I think, Todd, you mentioned that the remodels are generating about like a 3% to 6% sales lift, which I believe are at the lower end of the previous ranges you've given. So can you just talk about is there additional upside? What are some of the near-term dynamics you're seeing there?

And then longer term, given some of the changes in your competitive landscape with Family Dollar no longer really in the picture, drug stores closing. How does that change your view on your real estate opportunities and the growth rate you're willing to pursue?

Todd Vasos
CEO & Director

Yes, sure. We're really happy with the remodel program. As you know, we really are just in year 1. We haven't even cycled a full year yet of Project Elevate. And that's given us -- what we've seen so far has given us a lot of confidence. As a matter of fact, as you heard in my prepared remarks, we're going to do another 2,250 of those next year. So hitting right around 3% right now, but we're just getting started. So as we look to even enhance this program as we go into next year, we'll continue to look at ways to ensure we even get a better comp out of it. But 3% is very strong and is well within our guidance and our guidelines here to continue to move forward. It's a strong, strong return at 3%.

And then on Project Renovate at 6%, again, we're just getting going good there. We've been doing, obviously, these projects for many, many years. As we continue to rationalize our SKU base, our coolers, we see real opportunity to continue to drive long-term sales growth in these, albeit probably closer to 6% than the 8% that we have seen in the past. But again, I'll take a 6% comp any day of the week with the investments that we're putting forward on these. So again, gives us a lot of confidence to do another 2,000 of those next year. So really feel good about each of those. But we're retailers. We're never satisfied with the comps that we put out, and we're going to continue to push even harder.

And then long term, on your second part of the question, I would tell you, we still feel very good. We got 11,000 opportunities in the Continental United States to put a Dollar General store in. Obviously, as we said, we won't get all those. But your question pointed to the reason we're bullish on getting a lot of these is that our competition today is really not opening a lot of stores. And for that, we don't feel compelled to have to rush to open a lot of stores. So we believe that the right mix right now, 450 stores, still very strong for the year.

The right mix of remodel and new we believe is the right thing, taking care of that mature store base as we go forward is also strong. But with still close to 17% returns on new stores, we feel very bullish about what the future looks like with that 11,000 opportunities. And when we feel it's appropriate, we have the opportunity and the capacity to step it up from there.

The next question is coming from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.

Matthew Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats on a nice quarter. So maybe 2-part question. Todd, first, how would you assess current health of your low to middle income customer, maybe leveraging your latest survey work? And what's the traffic versus basket interplay that you've historically seen in similar economic backdrops?

And then for Donny, if you could maybe just touch on any puts and takes to consider as it relates to next year, just relative to the target to return earnings growth to 10% at 2% to 3% comps and tying in the moderated real estate plan for next year?

Todd Vasos
CEO & Director

Okay, Matt, yes, thank you. I'll start out. Yes, as we exited Q3, I would tell you that, that low middle end consumer continues to be stretched. She is definitely being very mindful of where she shops and what she shops for, making trade-off at the shelf in many instances. The great thing about Dollar General is that we offer extreme value here with a very convenient place to shop. And that is obviously resonating with the consumer with a 2.5% comp for the quarter. And I believe most notably, much different, by the way, than our competitors have put out there a 2.5% traffic number.

And if you think about it, when you think about traffic, we've always said here, traffic is the real measuring point, right, because that's the sustainability of the comp as we go forward. And we can leverage that additional traffic that we're seeing into long-term sustainable growth here at Dollar General. So stay tuned for that. We know how to also go after these customers. We've already started that retention program to ensure that we continue to keep the customer -- the new ones that we're seeing into the brand, both from the middle and the high end.

And then lastly, on that low-end consumer, when you think about where we sit in price, we have a very -- we feel very good about our everyday price, very good positioning there, a solid and balanced promotional cadence, which is always important for that low-end consumer. But the most important that she continues to tell us through our survey work, Matt, is that we've got over 2,000 SKUs at $1 or less every day inside of our stores.

As a matter of fact, the team did a great job this year, leveraging that low-end consumer work with our holiday performance. And as you think about holiday this year, we have 20% of our SKUs are at $1. We have 70% of the entire mix of holiday at $3 or less. So it's going to resonate pretty well. And I will tell you that we're off to a very nice start here in Q4.

Donny Lau
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And then in terms of your question on 2026 and long-term framework, Matt, we'll plan to provide more formal guidance on our Q4 earnings call in March. But overall, based on where I sit today, I do think it's fair to say that we're tracking towards the time lines contemplated in our long-term financial framework. And if you just take a step back at a high level, I feel really good about our ability to deliver against the long-term financial framework targets. I'm especially excited about the progress we're already making against some of the key targets. And so the way I think about it, Matt, is given all the great work the team has accomplished around our Back to Basics strategy, we've essentially stabilized the core, right? And the business is once again on really strong footing.

Obviously, a lot of work to do still, particularly around sustainability, but we're now able to execute better against certain, what I would call value drivers. And the great news is we're making great progress across many of these drivers. And I think that was reflected right in our strong Q3 operational and financial results. And so when you add it all up to me, we really are building momentum across many aspects of the business. We're ahead of schedule versus some of our initial targets that we laid out, and we'll continue to accelerate where we see opportunity. And so overall, I think there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic as we move ahead.

Your next question today is coming from Seth Sigman from Barclays.

Seth Sigman
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

My question is on digital and the incrementality that you mentioned. Can you talk about the value proposition? What is appealing about your offering for the consumer for delivery today? And if you can, maybe frame the contribution to total comps growth from delivery. How is that starting to help? And then just taking a step back, how does this change the economics of the business over time? Obviously, it's an important part of the long-term margin story. And so I think it would be helpful to sort of lay that out.

Todd Vasos
CEO & Director

Yes, I'll take the first part. I'll let Donny talk briefly on the economics. But Seth, we're very proud of where we are on our -- in our digital journey. Again, as we talked about our media network being in the very early innings, the second inning, I would tell you, our digital journey in totality is probably just in the second innings. So we're really just starting our journey. But I would tell you that we're off to a really nice start. It was a very nice contributor again this quarter.

But as I step back and think about our digital piece and what it looks like, when you think about the proposition for our core customer and quite frankly, for the customer just in general, what we're seeing early on is still very high incrementality rates of shoppers in the digital program, over 70% incrementality on how we're measuring it, which is a very, very strong piece, getting new customers. We're seeing much larger basket sizes through our digital properties, which really does, again, show that it's a different type of customer than our core, but also that we're starting to see more signs of a stock up versus what we normally see inside of our brick-and-mortar of fill-in. So we feel good about that incrementality piece, good about the extra piece.

Our real opportunity here is to continue to deliver to rural America. I think that's our value proposition at this point. And I believe we are off to a great start there. And by the way, we have a unique opportunity. We own rural America out there across the United States. And today, even in the second inning that we're in, over 70% of our orders that are done are delivered to an individual's front door in an hour or less, even in rural America. And that is a strong proposition that no one's been able to touch. And we'll continue to foster that and look at ways to even gain momentum across those properties.

Donny Lau
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. As Todd alluded to, we're especially pleased with the incrementality. I think the other way to think about that is we're introducing new customers to the Dollar General brand, right? And the great news is, as they engage with us, they engage more across our digital properties, right, which makes the DG Media Network even more attractive to our brand partners, which is fantastic. And so what I'm really excited about is we're seeing good growth here, and it is sales and profit accretive, which is obviously fantastic to see.

Next question is coming from Michael Lasser from UBS.

Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Donny, welcome back. My question is on the comp. You've now settled into a few quarters in a row of 2% comp. Is this as good as it's going to get? And does it provide enough margin of safety looking forward to next year when SNAP could become a headwind and other factors are going to be at play in the overall environment? And if that's the case, might you have to become more promotional, do more things like offer $5 off of $25 basket in order to drive the comp and you'll have to sacrifice the margin in order to drive the top line?

Todd Vasos
CEO & Director

Thank you, Michael. I'll start out and have Donny wrap that up. But we feel great about the 2.5% comp. As I indicated in the earlier question, the comp was strong at 2.5%. We've been well over 2% now a few quarters in a row. And as I think about Q4, we feel very good about the numbers we put out for full year guidance that would also portray a stronger comp in Q4. And as I think about the comp, the composition is so important, Michael. You know that. You've been with us on this journey for quite a while now, many years. And any time we can turn a 2.5% comp into a 2.5% ticket -- I'm sorry, traffic number, that is a very strong showing, and it bodes well for what the future holds in comp.

We're retailers. We're never satisfied with where we are. And I would tell you that we strive to turn even higher numbers. But the great thing about how I look at this business is that we always look for sustainability, not a quick win on the comp side. And I believe that's how we've put this together and what we're seeing as we go forward.

And then lastly, I would also tell you that from a promotional cadence perspective and what we see in the future, we believe we're uniquely positioned today and rightfully positioned. We don't see that changing at least in the near term into next year, we don't see a need to be more promotional. We think the way we have approached this with a great everyday price, a good balance of promotional cadence opportunities that we already have in place. And again, that very, very important $1 price point that we continue to offer the consumer puts us in a really unique position to drive comps.

Donny Lau
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And the only thing I'd add, too, Michael, is I also have -- we have a lot of confidence, right, in the 2% to 3% growth over the time period that we've outlined in the long-term framework. I think the great news is we're able to deliver against our long-term framework targets within this range. And I think the other thing to point out is the new stores and the remodels, they're expected to contribute about 150 to 200 basis points of that, right? And then on top of that, you layer in the growth we're seeing in new customers, trade-in, higher income, the playbook we have to retain them. I'd tell you, overall, we feel really good about our plans to build on our sales momentum balance of the year and beyond. And then we touched on this earlier, too, but on the margin line, overall, I'd tell you, I think we have more tailwinds and headwinds as we move into 2026 and beyond.

Next question is coming from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.

Simeon Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

My question is on getting back to 6% plus margins. Can you think about the construct? Should there be linearity to it? It sounds like retail media will be a big piece of it, but maybe not in the immediate year or so? Or is that the wrong way to think about it?

Donny Lau
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Maybe I'll let Todd touch a little more on the media network. I think we touched on it earlier. But at a high level on the margin side, Simeon, I'll tell you, I feel really good here also in terms of our ability to deliver against that margin target. We talked -- we touched on this a little bit, but there are a lot of drivers we have in place that we expect will contribute to margin expansion over time. I do want to note that while the focus is on the op margin line, right, gross profit obviously is expected to be the more meaningful contributor to margin expansion over this time period.

Within gross margin, we do continue to expect shrink and damages will contribute at least, right, 120 basis point expansion. We talked about this, but the great news is shrink is already improving at a faster and higher rate than we were initially anticipating a lot of reasons to think. We can deliver continued improvement over time on that front.

In terms of damages, right, they're trending in line with our expectations. Overall, really pleased with that progress. On the DG Media Network, as Todd alluded to, kind of early days. We do think it's going to be a meaningful contributor over time. The great news is we're just beginning to really build momentum against our initiative here. And just remember, there's a lot of other drivers in place that we expect to contribute as well, whether it's further reductions in kind of markdown risk and greater efficiencies across the supply chain, continued growth in the non-consumables business. We're seeing good growth coming out of private brands. And so overall, I'd tell you I just feel really good about our ability to drive continued gross margin expansion as we move ahead.

Todd Vasos
CEO & Director

Yes. And Simeon, I would tell you that is we do believe the media network as we go into the outer years of our long-term framework will be a substantial contributor. And the reason that we feel that way is we already are seeing nice large double-digit gains quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year. And I would tell you that as we pick up momentum on our native myDG digital platform, as those start to grow even more, what we start to see there is more first-party accounts, which then translates and we're able to monetize that with our vendor partners.

They see a lot of value in that because, again, uniquely positioned here because we own the data for lower end to middle-end consumers in rural America, where it is very difficult, if not almost impossible for anyone else to have replicated what we know about that customer and then how we monetize that over the long term. And for us, we believe that uniquely positions us to be able to deliver on that long-term framework as it relates to the media network.

Donny Lau
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And then just quickly, too, Simeon, just because we haven't really touched on this, but in terms of SG&A, right, just as a reminder, the goal here is to really minimize the deleverage. And I think we're really well positioned to deliver against this target as well. Just briefly, as a reminder, for this year, we do expect outsized incentive comp of approximately $200 million this year. So that should benefit next year as we -- I think it's fair to expect for us to plan for a more normalized rate there.

But in addition, right, the accelerated remodel program is expected to mitigate future R&M expense. In the meantime, we do expect to drive additional efficiencies through our work simplification efforts. And so overall, we feel really good about our efforts on the SG&A front as well.

And the one thing we really haven't spoken about at all is really AI, right? And I do think this provides a potential opportunity to maybe drive greater efficiencies and more sales as we move ahead. In fact, we recently hired a new Head of AI to accelerate our efforts here. And in the meantime, in the background, we are laying the foundation to enable AI at scale, right, with our IT modernization efforts. And importantly, what I would say is these additional efficiencies and potential opportunities for more sales growth that are associated with AI aren't captured in the framework today.

Next question is coming from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Partners.

John Heinbockel
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Todd, 2 related questions. Where do you think the greatest opportunity is on labor productivity? Because I don't think financially electronic shelf labels work in the Dollar Store setting or correct me if I'm wrong with that.

And then secondly, do you think you can get shrink down to 1% or so without adversely impacting sales? Or there has to be a natural floor that you don't want to go below?

Todd Vasos
CEO & Director

Yes, John, thanks for the questions. Yes, I would tell you, I'll start when you think about the shrink numbers, we feel good about where we're headed here. We had set our sights on around the 2019 levels of shrink. We felt really good about that. We are recalibrating to a better number because we're seeing even more opportunity. And I think you're leaning toward and I think importantly for me to point out is that our SKU rationalization efforts have really produced some of this outsized shrink opportunity on the good side that we've seen so far. And it should be the gift that keeps on giving because we believe that as we move into '26 and stay tuned as we talk about '26 when we come out with our fourth quarter results.

But rest assured that SKU rationalization and just inventory in totality will still be very top of mind in 2026. And with that, we believe that there's opportunity for even lower shrink numbers as we go forward. That's why I mentioned earlier that I feel that in that long-term framework, we can benefit probably from even better shrink than we had first anticipated. And if nothing else gives us great assurances that we can deliver on that long-term framework. But stay tuned, a lot of time ahead of us, but we feel good about that.

Operator

Next question is coming from Scot Ciccarelli from Truist Securities.

Scot Ciccarelli
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

And Todd, I think you started to touch a little bit on this, but you've had almost 2 straight years of inventory declines. Obviously, there's a major working capital benefit. But I have a 2-part question. One, can you guys size the positive margin impact that the lower inventory levels have had on both markdown activity and shrink? And then two, at what point do you need to start rebuilding your inventory levels?

Todd Vasos
CEO & Director

Yes, I'll take that. We're not going to quantify it, but I would tell you that what we've seen is -- and you mentioned it, we've intentionally gone out with SKU reduction. We've reduced over 2,500 everyday SKUs over the past couple of years. We've got more to go. And I would tell you that any good retailer does this over time. We don't believe there's a need to rebuild current inventory levels. We believe we're in many categories at optimal levels, but we also believe there's a lot of categories that we can still optimize. And that's what we'll be going after in '26 and beyond. So stay tuned and should benefit us on the shrink line and most importantly, on the damage line as we go forward.

The great thing I think we can all agree upon at this point is all those efforts have not hit us on the top line. As a matter of fact, we've continued to produce fill rates that are at some of our highest levels that we've seen in years here for the consumer. And obviously, you see the 2.5% comp this quarter and the traffic number. And that traffic number is a real good indication that she has a lot of confidence to continue to come into Dollar General and find what she needs. So we feel good about where we are. We don't believe for a moment that we're finished and more to come. We think that it's a real opportunity for us and a strong opportunity on that gross margin line, probably even more so as Donny indicated, than we even had first contemplated in that long-term model.

Next question is coming from Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett.

Charles Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Welcome back, Donny. I have 2 questions, just one near term, one long term. On the near term, Todd, can you just amplify on the strong start to November and the more positive outlook for the fourth quarter? How much of that's traffic driven? Have you seen any improvement in ticket?

And then longer term, there's a lot of concerns out there about Amazon and Walmart+. Can you talk about some of the key tenets of your competitive moat in the rural landscape and how you can compete more effectively?

Todd Vasos
CEO & Director

Yes, Chuck, thanks for the question. Yes, I would tell you, while we're not going to give you a ton of color on Q4, I would tell you we are off to a good start, a great start, quite frankly, we feel very good about that. Even in the face of some of the SNAP benefit holdbacks due to the government shutdown. I'll give you a little color around that, which I think is important because SNAP as we go into next year may have some headwinds to it, but we still see OB3 as a complete in totality, a tailwind for us.

And here's one reason on the SNAP side is what we saw was the consumer still needed to feed her family. She still has to do that. And she used cash as a tender with us in the -- during the shutdown time where she didn't get her benefit. And then as those benefits flowed in, we also then got the SNAP benefit on the second part of the month. So quite frankly, it was a net positive for us as we move through November. And not only in those areas, but she also bought a lot of the non-consumable categories. And holiday is off to a really good start as well. So feel bullish, but always keep in mind, a lot of quarter still left ahead of us with the important Christmas holiday selling season upon us at this point. But we feel, as Donny indicated, we have a fair amount of momentum heading into that holiday season and into next year.

And then lastly, your question around our competitive moat. I'd tell you, we feel good about the competitive moat. We have spent years, Chuck, and many, many dollars, as you know, not only building but strengthening that competitive moat in rural America. And with 80% of our stores in those small towns across America, very, very difficult to replicate, whether it be brick-and-mortar or whether it be on a digital basis. And again, we didn't sit back. We moved swiftly once we saw that our core consumer was starting to venture into her digital journey. We've always said our core customer, she's a fast follower. She'll get there, and she's starting to move that way. So we moved that way.

And the great thing is we moved that way with a lot of intentionality and that intentionality was really centered around rural America and be able to deliver that customer in an hour or less, where no one else can touch that at this point. We feel that's a very strong competitive moat, and we'll continue to do that, but also build on our ability to have a very strong and sustainable brick-and-mortar business as well as that digital business as we go forward.

Our final question today is coming from Spencer Hanus from Wolfe Research.

Spencer Hanus
Wolfe Research, LLC

I just wanted to circle back on the remodel program. The updated lifts you provided was helpful. But just curious what you think the tailwind could be in year 2, if there's any tailwind coming. And then just in terms of the price gaps, you called out that 3% to 4% gap versus [ mass ]. Have you seen any change there and how you guys are coming in from a pricing standpoint versus some of these other guys out there?

Todd Vasos
CEO & Director

Yes, I'll take those. I would tell you on the pricing piece that we feel very good about where we are, as I indicated earlier, not only our everyday price still falling within the bounds that our core customer looks to us to be able to provide her, but also around those promotional cadence, our TPR program, temporary price reduction program and our ad program, all deliver solidly to our core consumer and it's evident by those traffic numbers that we're seeing.

And then lastly, and I keep emphasizing this because it is such an important component to the low-end consumer, and that's that dollar price point is so, so important to that consumer. And with that, gives her a halo effect on price in totality within the Dollar General organization. So I would tell you that our price perception numbers through what we see in our consumer data is on the increase, while others may not be. And we feel very strong about that positioning as we go forward.

And then our programs around our new store programs, our remodel programs, we again feel very strong about where we're headed and the long-term possibilities that those hold, including our pOpshelf in Mexico banners. We feel good. We're in test and learn mode on those 2, but we're seeing very nice sales gains. The customer is resonating with each of those brands, but more to come there as well.

Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.
