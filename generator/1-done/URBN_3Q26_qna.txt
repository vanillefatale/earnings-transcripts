[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.

Lorraine Maikis
BofA Securities, Research Division

I wanted to follow up on the commentary around pricing. I think the words you used last quarter were gently and sparingly. And I wanted to see, a, how much of a customer reaction you've been able to realize from these price increases; and b, if the expectation was that you would continue to protect opening price points, especially at the Urban brand.

Richard Hayne
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

Lorraine, I'm going to ask Tricia to take that call -- that question.

Tricia Smith
Global Chief Executive Officer of Anthropologie Group

Lorraine, we're being highly strategic and thoughtful about taking price because there are definitely not across-the-board price increases. We've taken small price increases where we felt the price value equation was appropriate and have seen really little to no price resistance where we did so. We also want to stress that we remain committed to maintaining our opening price points and our pricing architecture and protecting those items that our customers count on to have great price value. Next, we're really planning very little incremental price increases over and above what we've already implemented this fall and holiday. We really don't anticipate price resistance. Our focus remains on protecting the integrity and the value of our product while we manage our cost structure appropriately.

Richard Hayne
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

Yes. And Lorraine, I want to emphasize that all the brands are protecting their opening price points, and furthermore, as we think ahead, we think that most of the price increases are behind us and that we'll have little need to raise prices next year.

Our next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays.

Adrienne Yih-Tennant
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I have to say, I mean, congratulations, every aspect, every geo, every brand, it's pretty amazing. So congrats to everybody.

Richard Hayne
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Adrienne.

Adrienne Yih-Tennant
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

You're very welcome. So Trish, just on kind of -- you talked about the own brand penetration. Can you talk about kind of where you are in the journey of own brand, where it could go and what the global footprint for Anthropologie may look like Europe versus North America? And then for Frank and/or Melanie, just on UO, so we have a, I think you said, a positive low single-digit segment margin in the quarter. Where does that bring us year-to-date? And I think earlier, you had said that you didn't think that this year you could break that profit barrier, right, to become positive. So I mean there's so much opportunity after this. So just a little color on kind of how you think about that for the year.

Tricia Smith
Global Chief Executive Officer of Anthropologie Group

Adrienne, our own brand growth, as mentioned in our opening remarks, has really been a source of strength for us as the brand, and we're really leveraging the talent and strength of our design teams, our buying teams. As I've mentioned, the penetration grew by almost 100 basis points versus last year, and we continue to plan and execute against our own brand growth outpacing that of just our total. We have successfully launched Celandine, LyreBird, leveraging daily practice and then really proud of the results the team has delivered with our Maeve expansion as a stand-alone brand and in our concept store.

So continued growth. We believe it will continue to outpace the total of our brand and expecting that to continue. I would say from a global footprint for our brand, really proud of the team successfully opening 2 stores in the U.K. in the past several weeks and excited about the Manchester opening that will be opening at the end of this week. So we're in a place where I think we'll continue, as we mentioned, to open stores in North America. We'll continue to gauge the results of the stores that we're opening abroad in the U.K. and see an opportunity for us to continue to do so.

Adrienne Yih-Tennant
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I also I think it's worth mentioning Pilcro.

Tricia Smith
Global Chief Executive Officer of Anthropologie Group

And Pilcro, yes, definitely.

Adrienne Yih-Tennant
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Pilcro had really good season.

Tricia Smith
Global Chief Executive Officer of Anthropologie Group

Yes, Pilcro has been a brand that has expanded significantly, and I would say several years ago from a penetration standpoint in denim, and that's grown significantly. Now it is our #1 performing denim lifestyle brand for Anthropologie. It has been significant.

Francis Conforti
COO & Co-President

And this is Frank, Adrienne, thanks for your question. I just want to give an update on Urban. So first and foremost, I just want to say it again. honestly, a huge congratulations to the entire team on the turn and the overall results. It's just -- it's really great to see the progress the teams are making delivering such strong sales growth and great profit improvement. Yes, as you noted, the brand was profitable on a global basis in the third quarter. This was driven by exceptional profit growth in Europe and a healthy reduction in the loss in North America.

We're not ready to give a forecast for exactly what next year could look like. Our business in Europe is already profitable and certainly was boosted by the extraordinary comp results so far this year. And while North America has delivered a meaningful reduction to their losses, they still have a healthy opportunity to continue progress into next year. And I would say, given the size of the opportunity in North America, it is possible that the brand turns globally to be profitable next year on an annual basis. But we'd like to see exactly where this year lands before we commit to exactly what next year will look like.

Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.

Matthew Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats on another nice quarter.

Richard Hayne
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Matthew.

Matthew Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So Dick, could you speak to drivers of the further acceleration in business that you saw during the third quarter, notably at the Urban brand. Maybe elaborate on early holiday selling trends that you mentioned. Just how you see the setup for your brands through holiday. And Frank, I think so with 100 basis points of operating margin expansion anticipated this year for the company, how best to think about margin drivers or levers beyond this year if we think multiyear?

Richard Hayne
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

Okay. Matthew, the drivers of the business across all the brands was the traffic. And traffic in stores and traffic online. And sales was almost exactly congruent with the increase in traffic. So I think that, that's what did it. As we look into holiday, we think that the same thing is occurring and we believe that the holiday season is likely to be very nice from a sales perspective, but we do expect it to be slightly more promotional than we saw last year.

So let's say our customers aren't responding well to the new fashion. They are and they are particularly responding to their gift-giving favorites, but we're waiting -- they're waiting more patiently for anticipated promotions. And the events we've run so far have been very successful. So judging by the strength of those promotional events and the strong back-to-school season and the surge in customer spending on holiday decorations, I anticipate a very good holiday season.

Francis Conforti
COO & Co-President

And Matt, I can touch on operating profit. So obviously, we're extremely proud of what we produced last year, delivering 100 basis points of improvement, getting to 8.6%. And based on our current plans, believe we can deliver approximately 100 basis points of improvement in fiscal '26, which would certainly put us very close to our 10% goal. As it relates to next year, I would just say it's a little early for us to commit to a rate. Obviously, as Melanie said, or as we target as a company, we're certainly going to target to keep SG&A at to below sales. But -- so then that leaves gross profit margins. And I just think there's a ton of uncertainty as to where tariffs are going to shake out given potential deals, supreme court rulings. Our tariff mitigation efforts are ongoing, and we'll have a better picture of this at the close of the year.

But the one thing I do want to say is with all that said around tariff impacts, if you were to ignore that for a minute, where our opportunities could land in gross profit would be driven by continued markdown improvement largely from the Urban Outfitters brand. We still think there's opportunity to leverage store occupancy. It's not on will the brands continue to drive healthy comp sales. And when you're excluding tariffs, we actually still think there's IMU opportunity, which is great to see at all brands.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi.

Paul Lejuez
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

You mentioned pressure on IMU a couple times, but also lower markdowns. So just curious, maybe you could talk a little bit about out-the-door merch margins, and what you saw by brand. And then second, on Nuuly, I'm curious if you've seen any change in the demographics in terms of age, income, regional of the new customers that you're attracting into that business versus what you've seen maybe several quarters ago.

Francis Conforti
COO & Co-President

Paul, this is Frank. I can take the sort of out-the-door IMU which was favorable given the markdown reduction for URBN. As we noted, sort of all brands were impacted by the tariffs. And the lion's share of the markdown improvement was driven by Urban Outfitters, but Free People also had a favorable markdown rate in the quarter. And Anthropologie was just slightly up, but also did a really good job at offsetting their -- excuse me, their IMU and high gross profit gains overall as a brand for the quarter. So all three brands contributed to -- within the Retail segment to the gross profit gains for the quarter. And then Dave, I don't know if you want to touch on Nuuly.

David Hayne
Chief Technology Officer & President of Nuuly

Yes. Paul, thanks for the question on Nuuly. I would say that largely, we are seeing our customer base remain relatively stable in terms of the curve across age, net subscribers, demographic, geography. If anything, I would say, we have seen a slight shift, ever so slight towards a slightly younger subscriber in terms of our new customer acquisition. And we've seen penetration from a subscriber standpoint, a slightly heavier penetration into the southern region of the country, more so than other geographies, mainly from a new customer standpoint. But those are just slight changes. There has not been a big transition or a big change in our -- the composition of our subscribers.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird.

Mark Altschwager
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Congrats on the strong results. I wanted to follow up on gross margins. First, I guess, where was the upside versus your plan for the third quarter? Any surprises there by brand or on the markdown front. And then just for Q4, you're commenting on expectations for higher promotions over holiday, given the shift in behavior. But you are maintaining your guidance for the full year. So just curious what the offsets are there that are allowing you to hold that plan?

Francis Conforti
COO & Co-President

Sure, Mark, this is Frank. I can take that. I think the outperformance in the third quarter was largely just -- top line came in really healthy. So you got some better leverage as it related to store occupancy, which was great to see with all brands contributing to that. As it relates to the fourth quarter, you hit the nail on the head. We are maintaining our annual plan and expectation in hopes of delivering 100 -- approximately 100 basis points of gross profit margin improvement. I would like to say I hope we're being conservative, but we do expect, as Dick noted, the holiday to be promotional. And if those promotional events are bigger than last year, that could have an impact on margins, and we're hoping that we're being conservative there.

This does not mean, and I just want to be clear about this, that we're planning on more or deeper promotions because we're not. It just means over the past several years, we've seen this concept of highers being high -- highs being higher and the lows being lower as it raises the sales impact -- sales events, I should say. So again, I hope we're being conservative with the level of improvement we're planning, and we're really excited and pleased to hopefully be able to deliver that 100 basis points on an annual basis.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley.

Alexandra Straton
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Congrats on a great quarter. Maybe Frank or Melanie to start, I think you've put a 10% long-term EBIT margin target out there, but you'll be very close, if not there this year. So just curious how you think about that longer term and maybe what pushes you beyond it. And then while we have Tricia on the call, I just wanted to take a step back on Anthro, feels like there's just been a structural change in the growth that, that business delivers versus where it was at pre-pandemic. So I'm just curious, like what's changed? And how do you think about the durable growth rate for that business over time?

Francis Conforti
COO & Co-President

And thank you for the congratulations, Alex, this is Frank. So as I said, we are still targeting 10% and, knock on wood, we're hopeful we get very, very close to that this year. Honestly, before we set a new goal, I'd like to hit the first goal. And as you know, and I think everyone knows, there's still plenty of opportunity for us to drive improvement. You've got things like the UO turnaround, which is certainly in play right now that brand, as we said, will still have healthy opportunity to drive operating dollars and profit rate gains into next year. You've got Nuuly growing at a really healthy rate and that gives us opportunity from a profit rate perspective as well.

As I mentioned, I think with all the brands delivering positive comps, you've got store occupancy leverage and excluding what's going on with tariffs, which hopefully, some of that changes in the future, I think all brands have IMU opportunity as well. So there's several levers out there that I think we can pull and hopefully deliver to exceed. But for right now, we're not setting a new target. I'd like to hit the first target first and hit that 10% and operate at it and then we'll reset the goal.

Tricia Smith
Global Chief Executive Officer of Anthropologie Group

Alex, I'll speak to Anthropologie, thank you for the question. Our team set out a little over 4.5 years ago with really three strategic priorities. But really, I would say, first and foremost, it was getting or delivering on our ability to drive full price sales, which was really focused on newness. A lot of that came from really focusing and investing in our own brands, as I had mentioned. But I would say, as we've worked on modernizing our product assortment, diversifying the categories that we're able to deliver and ensuring that we have a broad-based appeal for the multigenerational customer base that we serve has really been the bigger driver of that.

Our customer base as we focused on growth and acquisition, but also retaining our existing customers, has delivered over 50% increase in the last 4 years in our total customer count. And I think as we leverage that and think about how we execute and we deliver experiences both in stores and our teams have been very, very focused on ensuring that those experiences in the service delivers and exceeds our customer expectations, but also investing, I would say, in our digital capabilities, multiple factors contributing to our ability to be able to deliver improved conversion.

And then I would say just lastly, making sure that we really deliver on those exceptional experiences and leverage our team's capabilities of design and creative and buying, we believe that we've really built a sustainable model for growth coming out of, I'd say, pre-pandemic that we've been able to deliver on and are proud of our team's ability to execute on those.

Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.

Dana Telsey
Telsey Advisory Group LLC

Congratulations on the product -- on the progress. As we think about the product -- that's all I'm thinking about. As you think about the consumer, and Dick, you mentioned it, some of them waiting closer for deals. Any framework for that? Is that across all brands, all demos, all regions or anything you're seeing in terms of the promotions that you need to drive. And then it was interesting on Nuuly with the continuing average active subscriber growth over 42% or whatever, it sounded like on the gross margin commentary, some of them are buying more of the rental product now. Are you seeing that shift? Is it from all ages, all income levels? And how does that impact the margin?

Richard Hayne
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Dana. The consumer pausing to wait for promotions, I guess I would chalk it up to intellect. I mean they know the promotions are coming, as I said to you, we saw a very rapid process in mid to late October in people putting items in their carts. And that signaled to us that this was the beginning of, okay, we know what we want. We know there are promotions coming. So why not wait? And if you think back maybe 2 or 3 years ago, when everybody was so worried about, oh, there's not -- I guess, it's because the transportation was difficult out of the Far East with COVID.

And everybody thought, oh, there's not going to be enough to go around and people started buying earlier and earlier. I think what we're really seeing is just a reversion to what we saw before COVID when people did wait and they did partake more in promotions. So I don't think there's any particular magic to it. I don't think it says much about the consumer other than they're smart. Dave, do you want to take the Nuuly, or Frank?

David Hayne
Chief Technology Officer & President of Nuuly

Yes, sure, I'm happy to touch on it. Dana, you're absolutely correct. We did see a higher rate of sales to the customer in this quarter, and that has a lower gross profit than the subscription sales to the customer. There's a lot of ways in that we can sell product to the customers sort of in the box through a marketplace through their direct website. We're not really seeing anything different from demographic from age or a geography perspective as to where those things are coming from. And I think it will just be variable from one quarter to the next.

Our next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro with The Retail Tracker.

Marni Shapiro
The Retail Tracker

Congrats to everybody.

Tricia Smith
Global Chief Executive Officer of Anthropologie Group

Thank you.

Marni Shapiro
The Retail Tracker

I must say, oh, my god. And that cardigan with the flowers that is like rich thrift store vibes, so good. So my questions are for you. I hate baseball metaphors. And I understand Europe is on solid ground. But I guess where do you feel like UO is in this recovery process. And could we also just touch on men's. I feel like we glided by past, you had sounds like some stabilization and slight improvement in men's. I'm curious if the men's business is a smaller part of Urban's business at this point, given it's been a little tougher even than women's. And is it still putting pressure on margins, or is it neutral at this point?

Tricia Smith
Global Chief Executive Officer of Anthropologie Group

Hi, Marni, thank you for the nice comments. You're talking about the Rachel cardigan. It's one of our biggest and most beloved items. So I'm glad that you love it and lots of customers do too. I'm really, really proud of that item. So I think your first question, where do we sit in the recovery? First, we recognize that this is a journey. We're incredibly proud of the team and I think the team is executing really well on our plan. They are staying acutely focused on the customer.

In Q3, really, that was about occasions of getting back to campus. Same day was a big occasion and reentering campus life. From a product perspective, I think we continue to be excited about the categories that customers see us as a destination for that would be denim and lounge and really anchored in our own brands, BDG and Out From Under. In marketing, the team continues to really delight customers, meeting them in places and moments that matter, some exciting partnerships and activations in the third quarter, whether that was celebrating On Rotation with UGG, which is our newest partnership and on rotation experience or the partnership with Canva, which was a really exciting proud moment. Our team through insights with customers heard that 54% of young customers make wish lists for their holiday -- for their holiday gift list. And so we partnered with Canva and had 3 unique formats that our creative team developed with 100 products and drop-down menus just from Urban Outfitters. That experience is live today with lots of customers participating in it and something that we're really excited about.

And from a channel or touch point perspective, feeling excited about the progress that teams are making there, seeing our creative really showing up in our stores, on our digital channels, across social, really evolved to be much more upbeat, really inclusive and I think representing our product in a really, really delighting way. And we're excited to have opened 2 new stores, representing our new store environment. I think we're hearing great things from our customers. Certainly, the environment is bright, I think more modern and flexible from our perspective, allowing us to ebb and flow with categorical performance and we're really excited about the early reads we're seeing from a productivity perspective in those 2 stores as well.

Your next question on men's. We are real excited about what we're seeing in men's. You heard us mention that perhaps from the last call. Real proud of the men's team and the progress that they're making. This started with their focus on the customer as well. And they identified an opportunity to really broaden the assortment as they broaden the range of customers that they were serving to for them, that really meant being more versatile and focusing on young college guys. These are simple people. We have an opportunity to really be more versatile and focus on more outfitting and wardrobing for this customer.

So the team had prioritized really redesigning and rebuilding our core items and anchoring in core categories. That's bottoms, pants, jeans and sweats. [ Go figure ] and some of their tops, so fleece programs and woven tops. And that is resonating really well. And so with some new customers in the business, really proud to see that we are now a destination where they have more to buy from us than ever. Men's is an important part of our business, and I think that we really have an opportunity to differentiate in the marketplace and be a destination, not just for our own branded products, but be a place where we can have some of the best national and discoverable brands for men. And that's something the team is working on as well.

Richard Hayne
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

Marni, if I may, I'd like to say a word about Urban. As an ex simple college guy, who hasn't gotten much more complex as the years gone by. I want to give Sheila a big shot-out and also both team leaders, Shea, in North America and Emma in Europe. They both delivered outstanding quarters. And Shea and her team produced the double-digit comp sales that you've heard about and strong -- very strong double-digit full-price sales. It shows that the turnaround strategy is working very well. In Europe, Emma and her team accomplished something I've really never seen in my many years in this business. They delivered a 17% comp sales gain with single-digit less comp inventory and very strong positive double-digit full price sales. So clearly, the momentum for both geographies is strong going into the holidays, and I just want to give my congratulations to all global Urban brand employees.

Our next question comes from the line of Janet Joseph Kloppenburg with JJK Research Associates.

Janet Kloppenburg
JJK Research Associates, Inc.

Can you hear me?

Richard Hayne
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

Yes, we can.

Janet Kloppenburg
JJK Research Associates, Inc.

I don't have to tell you how excited I am about such a strong quarter. But I wanted to talk to Shea about Urban. When I look at it, Shea, and I followed the company a long time, it looks like you are working to broaden the assortment and the customer that you're targeting. And I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about that. And if your pricing strategy has changed and if what they're doing in Europe is similar to what you're doing here?

Shea Jensen
President of Urban Outfitters Brand of North America

Hi, I'll take that first. This is Shea. Yes, one of the first things that we did was a lot of customer research. And I think that we had identified that we had become unintentionally niche or narrow as it related to our product assortment. We had been focused on a bit of grungy, a bit of a narrow assortment. And I think we recognized an opportunity to be a bit more broad and welcoming in terms of our assortment and listening to our customers. They told us very clearly. We love your denim, and we love your lounge, and we love those 2 brands, BDG and Out From Under. But we weren't giving our customers enough of those brands and enough of those categories. So that is what we've been focusing on and the customer has been responding in like a lot.

Richard Hayne
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

In sales.

Shea Jensen
President of Urban Outfitters Brand of North America

Yes, in sales. And we're going to keep giving it to them as long as they keep responding.

Richard Hayne
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

And Janet, I'm going to ask Sheila to talk about similarities with Europe.

Sheila Harrington
Global CEO Urban Outfitters Group & CEO of Free People Group

So I think the similarities of the consumer focus is very strong between Shea and Emma. Obviously, the customer is slightly different in what they want at any given time, knowing that Emma is touching on Europe, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, et cetera, and the countries that she's touching and just like similarities in North America or New York and the south respond differently to products. I think both leaderships are concentrating on their consumer, and that feels really, really good. It's a great collaboration, hearing a product between both countries to find the best results for the consumer. I'm proud of Emma's growth because it's not only just coming from the U.K. now. There's double-digit growth coming from multiple countries that she's continuing to build on and will in the foreseeable future as our continued store growth happens in Europe.

Our next question comes from the line of Jay Sole with UBS.

Jay Sole
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I have two questions. First, just curious about your wholesale business. As you look into next year, I'm curious about the kind of orders that you're getting from your wholesale partners, given it's possible they might have a different view of what 2026 might look like. And then there's some speculation today that Red Sea shipping lanes might open up. If that does happen, what might that -- how might that impact your margins next year if shipping rates go back down to where they were.

Francis Conforti
COO & Co-President

Jay, I could take the Red Sea shipping lanes. I would just say, obviously, if that happens, the more lanes, the more opportunities, the better the opportunity is for us. But it's a little early for us to speculate exactly what rates are going to look like and what the impact could be. But yes, that would be a positive. Supply and demand are good things and a greater supply of transportation opportunities is a good thing for us.

Richard Hayne
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

And I will ask Sheila to take the wholesale question.

Sheila Harrington
Global CEO Urban Outfitters Group & CEO of Free People Group

So I'm going to answer, wholesale, it's exciting time for wholesale because we're seeing the brand, both Free People and FP Movement perform extraordinarily well within our wholesale account base. So we do believe that as we continue to react and learn from our customer, from our C2C perspective, we have the only opportunity to continue to fuel our wholesale channel with the partners that we've built. I think FP Movement had a spectacular quarter at wholesale this year. And we don't necessarily see that slowing down. We see our specialty store business thriving as we specialize our product into the outdoor space, our studio space and the international opportunity we have with both brands. So we're really excited.

Richard Hayne
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

I believe that finishes the call. I thank you all very much. I wish you a very, very happy Thanksgiving. I know we've got a lot of work to do. There was a backlog of companies reporting today. So I appreciate it, and we will talk to you soon.
