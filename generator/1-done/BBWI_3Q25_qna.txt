Question-and-Answer Session


Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.


Irwin Boruchow
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I guess, Daniel, my question would be, can you help us understand bigger picture kind of what changed between when you first joined the company? I believe you kind of talked to an expectation to accelerate growth while expanding margins obviously, today's expectations for 4Q revenue to be down, margins that compressed goes against that. Can you maybe just walk us through what exactly has changed, what you've learned since you've been there? And exactly how should we be thinking about what Q4 guidance kind of means to next year would also be helpful.


Daniel Heaf
CEO & Director

I can thank you for the question. So let me start by reemphasizing that the third quarter results and the lower expectations for the fourth quarter don't live up to the expectations that we all have for this brand. The brand is not fulfilling its potential. I joined to accelerate growth, and I remain confident that we will do so.

So directly to your question, what's changed, if we unpack our Q3 performance, we declined in each of our core categories, and that really underscores the diagnostic I gave in our opening remarks. That focus on adjacencies has resulted in underinvestment in our core and not keeping pace with our consumer.

But again, this strategic reset is the result of months of detailed analysis in every part of our business. It isn't a reaction to the quarter. And if we look across the last few years, and you guys all know this, while we've been able to drive some growth in some quarters, we've lagged the market. We've lagged the beauty and fragrance sector and the growth that we've delivered was not durable. I've talked about that since I arrived and now is the time to address that. We've laid out the diagnosis clearly. We've laid out a very clear plan how we're going to put the consumer back at the center, reignite the brand, begin creating innovative, coveted disruptive products in our core categories again.

And those 4 pillars of our strategy have already been communicated to the whole company. Work is well underway. And what gives me confidence, honestly, in this plan is that this is a pattern I've seen many times in my career in many other places, many other companies. And this is really about going back to what made this company so great but evolving to meet the needs of today's consumer.

We will deliver coveted product. We will deliver elevated experience, but that change isn't going to happen overnight. Now to the next -- what this means for Q4, an excellent question. And the macro is a significant factor in our Q4 guide. And Eva, can I hand to you for some more color on that?


Eva Boratto
Chief Financial Officer

Sure, sure. Ike, so I guess I said in my prepared remarks, right, the outlook we're providing for Q4 reflects what we believe is the floor, right? We saw material changes in trends affected by the macro coming into the quarter. We've seen some modest improvement since the government reopened, and we're further taking actions to improve that.

That said, our underlying core performance was weak, as Daniel said. If you looked at our Q3, we were down 1%. But if you were to normalize for the expansion of the fall sale extension, we were probably down closer to 3%. So if I look forward to 2026, our current view is that we do not expect to deliver growth for the full year. These initiatives that we've laid out today will become visible to consumers throughout the year.

But realistically, we don't expect it to impact the business in any meaningful way until the second half of the year. Digital is the fastest-growing space in beauty. We know those enhancements are underway. As Daniel said, evolving our core product, which is critical to attract that new customer. That will start to become visible in the second half of the year. So we are here. We are working with urgency, driving the changes we need to drive that durable growth, and we'll have more details on our Q4 earnings call.

Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.


Matthew Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So Daniel, maybe to pick up on that. So on the new strategy, so the last 2 years, the company has talked positively about adjacencies and collaborations. But now that strategy is wrong, and the focus is on the core to drive durable growth. So could you provide maybe some of the key KPIs that you're watching to gain confidence in this new strategy? And while you cited the change won't happen overnight, I mean what do you see as a reasonable time line for stabilization?


Daniel Heaf
CEO & Director

Great. Thank you, Matt, for the question. So first, I'm going to say that this strategy has been communicated to the whole company. Work is, as Eva said, underway. Teams are working feverishly against those 4 priorities. But let me show some progress that is already evident. Firstly, let's take a look at talent in a very short amount of time, we've added tremendous talent to our team where we saw gaps and where we saw a need to improve our executional ability, we've moved with speed.

A couple of moves I would highlight. We've brought in Veronique Gabai. She obviously brings global beauty experience, creative vision and has worked at iconic brands across Estee Lauder and L'Oréal. Craig Smith in digital, 2 decades of building digital transformation at Burberry, Apple, LVMH [indiscernible] unrivaled wholesale experience for more than 30 years at brands like L'Oréal and [indiscernible]. And as you'll have seen in the press release last week, Maly Bernstein, a transformational retail leader who has a track record in driving incredible results across beauty and omnichannel businesses. So where we saw gaps, we've already addressed that.

Next, when you think about the things that we talked about on the call that we expect to be delivering in the short term, winning in the marketplace. We know we need to be more convenient to consumers. We know that we need to be in their path, and you'll see us launch on Amazon early next year. And I mean, frankly, we already know that we're doing somewhere between $60 million to $80 million of gray market sales in that channel that is brand dilutive and profit dilutive. And so launching there is an incredible sales opportunity, but also an opportunity to reignite the brand, that second pillar of our strategy.

And then from day 1, we have recognized the digital opportunity, and we are moving with pace there. We relaunched our app. We relaunched the website. We have new product photography coming in on roughly about 500 of our current SKUs, elevated claims and messaging. But we know we have got so much further to go. We are working with pace, but the opportunity there is enormous. If we think about just the penetration of digital sales. So Eva and I were talking about this just last week.

In soaps and sanitizers, the percentage of e-commerce sales in that category is about 40% to 45%. Our current e-commerce penetration is 20%. That just represents the incredible opportunity that we have to drive growth and acquire new customers in the digital channel.

Now when it comes to metrics, of course, there's all the normal metrics that we're going to be tracking and delivering revenue, operating income, EPS. But where I'm really focused is in total active consumers and growth in our core categories. Underneath that, of course, we are measuring the retail equation. And if you think about digital in the most recent quarter since we've made some of the modest changes already, we're seeing an increase in traffic. We're seeing an increase in dwell time. So these are good leading indicators for the progress that we are making.


Eva Boratto
Chief Financial Officer

And Daniel, if I could just add, Matt, to your question about stabilization, I'll just say again, we don't expect growth in the full year next year, but we certainly expect business to improve as we progress throughout the year. And in the second half of the year is where more of our consumer-first plan initiatives will come to fruition with new products with further time under our belt in terms of digital, and we'll continue to update you as we progress on this plan.


Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.


Lorraine Maikis
BofA Securities, Research Division

Daniel, it's clear that the underlying business is worse than you thought when you first joined, and it will take time to return to growth. Does your plan require more investment than you had originally thought? And how should we think about margins in 2026 as we balance these investments with cost cuts?


Daniel Heaf
CEO & Director

Lorraine, yes, the reason we did such a comprehensive diagnostic right across the business, it was about discovering and laying out exactly what is holding this incredible brand back. And it's clear to me that the core is weaker and some of that was masked by promotions and collabs and anniversarying some of those adjacent product launches.

So 2026 will be absolutely about investing behind our brand and our product, investing in the things that the consumer sees to strengthen our fundamentals and position this brand for long-term sustainable growth. Now as Eva mentioned in her opening remarks, that the teams are already hard at work in unlocking $250 million of additional savings to help fund these investments. And we have -- and before I arrived, this team has a strong track record in looking for efficiencies to fund investments. They've done that successfully over the last few years. And yes, of course, until we see that top line growth, which we are pursuing with vigor, we will be pressurized by deleverage.


Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley.


Alexandra Straton
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. Maybe just on the cost savings program, that $250 million in the next couple of years. Can you just go through where exactly you're trimming and how they're different from the cost reduction that was pursued under Gina? And then does all of that get reinvested so we're sort of in the same margin place? Or maybe just help us with how we should think about SG&A and how it should grow in relation to sales over time as we're thinking about the out-year margin trajectory?


Eva Boratto
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. Alex, this is Eva. So we're really proud of the savings that we've delivered over the past couple of years, delivering about $300 million in savings. We're targeting, our goal is another $250 million, as Daniel said.

As I think about where that will come from continued activities like value engineering, opportunities. We have further opportunities in sourcing optimization, also logistics operations. Daniel spoke about SKU simplification. That simplification will bring cost reductions over time, and we'll continue to optimize our overall operations to drive cost savings as we prioritize focusing on high-value consumer-focused areas. We're working hard to fuel and fund the investments that are required over the next couple of years.

I would think about the savings that we're driving are offsetting the investments and are not flowing to the bottom line. In the shorter term, there could be some mismatches that investments outpaced savings. We'll have more details there. Our focus is to make the right investments to drive the durable growth and do that in a responsible way.


Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup.


Kelly Crago
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

This is Kelly on for Paul. I just -- first, I had 2-parter here. One on the Amazon partnership. If you could just elaborate on sort of the product that's going to be in that channel versus the store and if that makes you the expanded distribution, whether that makes you rethink your store growth and your store base?

And then secondly, on free cash flow, still very strong free cash flow this year despite weakness in the business. Any color on how we should think about free cash flow for F '26? Any kind of color you could provide there would be great.


Daniel Heaf
CEO & Director

Thanks so much, Kelly. Let me just -- I'll start by just touching on the Amazon partnership. Obviously, that's part of our third strategy, win in the marketplace, and that is about being in the part of the consumer. As I said, in answer to an earlier question, we know our consumer is already there. We are doing millions of dollars of sales in that channel. We're going to start with a small assortment. We're going to be -- it's really going to be some of our evergreen products, and we're really going to make sure that we get that absolutely right that we test and learn that we build the right PDPs, the right ratings and the reviews that we're offering the right fulfillment services before we start to thoughtfully expand that assortment with new products that will be targeted at acquiring a new consumer.

But we're feeling very optimistic about that component of our strategy. And maybe, Eva, if I hand over to you on the free cash flow.


Eva Boratto
Chief Financial Officer

Sure, sure. Thanks, Kelly, for the question. I'll just reiterate, we are a strong cash-generating business. And overall, our capital allocation priorities remain the same, investing in the business, and you've heard us say that those investments will increase next year to support our transformation, maintain a strong balance sheet and return cash to shareholders, which we've done over the last 3 years, returning $1.5 billion. We are headed into our biggest quarter of the year.

So as I think about cash for next year and projections for next year, we'll come back to you in February on that. But we remain focused on continuing to focus on working capital and driving cash out of the business.


Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird.


Mark Altschwager
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

As you pivot back to the core categories, can you talk about the innovation pipeline over the next 12 to 18 months and how you're thinking about the balance between legacy franchises and then some of the ingredient-led or efficacy demands for the younger consumers you're targeting?


Daniel Heaf
CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Mark. So let me start by saying that in our core categories, we remain the market leader. It is, without question, where we have the greatest right to win, and we started this work for our strategy in designing those 2-consumer music. It is not about leaving our current customer behind and reaching for a new consumer. It is about serving both. If you think about Jen, she is probably more atypically the kind of customer that we have today, and we believe that we can elevate our product proposition and continue to attract more of those customers as well as reaching for a new, younger consumer, the Zoe, if you like.

And what she requires is, as you say, more ingredient-led, cleaner, more stylishly or more sophisticated design in packaging, and that is where our investment is headed. So without question, we have underinvested in our core. Let's take a look at our packaging. Some of our core forms, I don't think have been restaged for a decade, right? That will change. We are already building a very strong pipeline of innovative new concepts, and we expect them to come to life in the back half of the year. And I'm excited about what I'm seeing from the product design and merchandising team.


Eva Boratto
Chief Financial Officer

And Daniel, if I could just add, in addition to the innovation, we are taking immediate actions on the innovation front. And we've changed and we're involving consumer testing much earlier in the process to ensure as we shape this innovation to attract that new consumer, we are hitting the mark. As Daniel said earlier, we're making choices to exit categories that haven't been successful for us that increase complexity such as men's grooming and hair, and we'll continue to work to optimize our portfolio as well.


Daniel Heaf
CEO & Director

Yes. And Mark, I just want to follow up on your question. You talked about the new products, and you also talked about, let's call it, the core or the carryover product, which in some way, I think, hit that what we have to do. As I said in my opening remarks, we have the iconic fragrances -- it's been one of the big things that was an upside on what I thought when I arrived. Some of those biggest frequencies are doing over $250 million a year annually and they sit on a shelf in the left-hand side of our store, and they operate somewhat like an annuity. Customers come in and they buy them, but we haven't treated them with the reverence and with the marketing they expect.

So part of that second pillar of our strategy is reigniting our brand. And part of that is about showing the reference for those iconic franchises, those iconic fragrances, building a world around them, taking them out to new consumers in alternative distribution channels, I'm sure that future Zoes and future Jens are going to love some of the products that we already have, and it's just about making the big, bigger.


Mark Altschwager
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

A quick follow-up for Eva. Just with the earnings reset here, the leverage ratio is edging higher how comfortable are you with the leverage ratio medium term? And just any shift we should think about and how you're balancing buybacks with potential debt reduction.


Eva Boratto
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. We've made tremendous progress over the last couple of years, bringing the leverage ratio to our target 2.5x level. This challenging period will put pressure on that. We will -- you should expect we will pay our debt down that comes due in January of 2027, and we'll work vigilantly to bring our balance sheet to the position that we want to. And as I said earlier, our capital allocation priorities are the same.


Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays.


Adrienne Yih-Tennant
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Daniel, thank you so much for the detail. This is -- it's really refreshing to hear on the strategy and the movement of the business. But in doing so, I guess, can you help us understand the timing of the exit of the non-go-forward categories? Is that sort of like a Q1 thing? I'm sure there's some hangover inventory. What's the best method of exiting those categories without kind of further putting kind of brand pressure, right, as you kind of exit those?

And then within the core categories, we had talked about SKU rationalization and obviously, you're talking about focusing on fewer of the things that mean something. So how many of the kind of alternative scents and kind of that newness that you bring to the seasonal scents will now go away to help focus?


Daniel Heaf
CEO & Director

Okay. Thank you so much for the question. Look, let me just underscore that everything that we do at this company is subject to a rig to rigorous testing. And that is something that we have integrated, as Eva said, as part of our product development process, and that is true about the way we think about our assortment.

So we're not pursuing a SKU rationalization target for the sake of having a target. We're pursuing it because the customer tells us that our proposition in store is too overwhelming and confusing. So this is the outcome that we want is to be able to entice new consumers into our stores and onto our digital platform. They can find what they want easily and fall in love with what they like easily.

So I think about it less as a number to hit and a set of categories to exit than I do about reaching a consumer outcome. That said, we'll begin to rationalize our SKUs and begin to exit these categories in spring, so in the first quarter of next year. And we will ramp that up with testing and exits as we move through the balance of '26. But it's really test, learn and make sure that we are bringing the new products to market that we're elevating, as I said, some of those new -- some of those core franchises that are already large so that we're filling the gap. It's less about, I would say, hitting the number.


Eva Boratto
Chief Financial Officer

Adrienne, your question on hangover of inventory. As you know, we have 2 seasonal -- 2 semiannual sale periods that we're able to use to clear inventory. The company has a long history of successfully doing that. We -- despite the pressures in Q3, we were able to exit Q3 with clean inventory as we use that fall sale period. So we'll be really thoughtful on our inventory management and our decisions around timing and when to exit.


Adrienne Yih-Tennant
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Helpful. And then, Eva, just a little bit of help on the exit categories. What's the aggregate dollar amount that they contributed in 2025? And how should we think about the wraparound tariff pressure into 1Q?


Eva Boratto
Chief Financial Officer

Okay. So I'll take the tariffs first. Overall, the tariffs, I would think about on a full year basis, it's basically comparable to 2025. In 2025, we had about 100 basis point of impact to the year. Expect that to be pretty comparable in 2026.

Now the timing of that first half will have a bit more of a headwind given when tariffs started with the reverse impact in the second half. In terms of the dollars of the exited categories, we'll have more to say as we build toward 2026. We don't expect that to be a meaningful drag.


Daniel Heaf
CEO & Director

No, not. The problem is those adjacencies haven't grown in the way that we had expected, and they are not significant the ones that we are starting to take out. So we're looking at every merchant does SKUs that are not contributing that much and SKUs that are not productive, and that's where we're starting in that long tail.


Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Jonna Kim with TD Cowen.


Jungwon Kim
TD Cowen, Research Division

Daniel, just on the competitive dynamics within the fragrance and body category, I know a lot of new entrants have entered the category in the last few years. How are you assessing the competitive dynamics there? And then you also mentioned shortening lead times, which category needs more work in your view?


Daniel Heaf
CEO & Director

Great. So yes, we operate in a very competitive sector. I love the sector. It still continues to grow. It's a young sector with sort of youth and innovation at its heart. And I think that, obviously, we operate as the market leader in these categories. We have a right to win. We're building on a solid base.

So for me, some of the problems that we have in our product are what I would call perception problems. We have fantastic formulations that are clean, but we have not communicated those benefits consistently and effectively. So we know in our product testing with consumers and some of the blind testing that we do that we far outperform some of those competitors that are often talked about, but we don't market it correctly. We don't put it in elevated packaging. And as a result, the consumer doesn't see us as having the attributes that they need.

And then in some of the areas that we're looking at, we will launch new forms and new vessels and those types of things and new formulations. And those sort of things take longer than just chasing into demand, which is what our supply chain is really good at. But together, the teams at Bath & Body Works and our fragrance house partners and our manufacturing partners, we are all working day and night to make sure that we are bringing this new innovation to market, and we're looking forward to starting that journey in the back half of 2026.


Eva Boratto
Chief Financial Officer

And Daniel, can I just add one thing. As you look at these categories that we're in that we're all excited about and our growing categories, growth in digital is outpacing the market. So the strategies that we're talking about today and the investments we're making in our own digital experience as well as alternative distribution and our presence on Amazon, we think are key elements to capturing and bringing that new consumer in as well.


Daniel Heaf
CEO & Director

And part of the -- we've talked about being in the part of the consumer. And that, of course, is what drives everything in this business now, putting the consumer at the center. But I'm looking forward to competing with those competitors on that playing field, right? We have left Amazon wide open for competitors to play. That is changing.

We have left other wholesale partners wide open for those competitors to play. That is going to change also. So to me, I'm looking forward to putting our products front and center, telling bolder motive stories and winning in the full marketplace.


Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Jay Sole with UBS.


Jay Sole
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Daniel, I want to just follow up on that last question. Is there a tension at all between entering Amazon and potentially other mass market channels and sort of maintaining an iconic brand image? And if so, how do you feel about navigating that?


Daniel Heaf
CEO & Director

No. I think about it not as either/or. I think you look at some of the world's luxury brands there on Amazon. And I think it's as much as a sales opportunity as I think it's a brand opportunity. I can't wait to tell an elevated story about this brand in third-party channels and in particular, on the largest shop in the world on Amazon. What would I believe to do to change product perception will be in all channels and particularly on social channels actually. And that work that what I call brand reignition work and brand reigniting work is well underway.

And by that, I mean, we have seen visuals. We have seen photography. We have seen tone of voice and everybody who's seen it is blown away by it. Customer testing just this week and our consumers, both current and future, love the direction that we are taking this brand.


Jay Sole
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I understand. And maybe if I can just follow up on that. I mean what about just the concern that entering Amazon will cannibalize traffic into the stores and obviously create a separate issue.


Daniel Heaf
CEO & Director

Well, our product is already on Amazon. We're doing $60 million to $80 million roughly in sales on that product -- of our product from gray market on Amazon today. So just going there and making it a brand-accretive experience, making it a profit-accretive experience is the first thing that we look to do.

And actually, I think that telling the story of our brands across digital channels will drive traffic in stores. And then finally, we have a very wide assortment, maybe too wide an assortment in places. And so we have an opportunity to use that assortment thoughtfully across multiple channels to drive differentiated propositions to acquire different types of customers. And so I think that this strategy is wholly accretive.


Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James.


Olivia Tong Cheang
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Really helpful diagnosis of the areas of improvement. And I know Amazon was something you've been hinting at for some time. So I'm sure you're excited to get going on that. So a couple of questions with that. Can you talk about the sales expectations and the margin profile of launching on Amazon? You obviously mentioned the $60 million to $80 million in sales already. Clearly, your hope is to go above that but just trying to think about the arc of building on that and then the margin profile as well, whether that you expect that to be at similar margins, dilutive, accretive, that would be helpful.

On the exit of the categories, the ancillary categories that you launched into a couple of years ago, could you help us understand a little bit of the decision-making as to why not continuing to run the business? Of course, it's a distraction, but it is offering some sales. And a lot of the heavy lifting, more importantly, has already been done. And I would imagine that, that's something that could work in other channels.

And then Eva, one for you is just around how we should think about the cash flow progression next year. You talked about earnings, but would love to hear your views in terms of the working capital, in particular, given launching new channels, clearing out the old inventory, how you think about the arc in working capital?


Daniel Heaf
CEO & Director

Great. So I'll start on Amazon and then move to adjacencies, and then I'll hand to Eva for cash flow. On Amazon, we're very excited about the opportunity, as I'm sure you can hear. We believe it's the right thing to do for our consumer, and it sits squarely in our third pillar of our strategy. The plan is to go slow to go fast, right? We're going to launch with a tight assortment. We're going to make sure that we are optimizing those pages for the Amazon consumer that we're providing the right level of product description that we're providing the right level of PDP that we build up a really incredible bank of ratings and reviews.

And as we start to gain success in that channel, we will build out the assortment over time. But as I said in my opening remarks, our owned channels will remain the widest expression of our assortment and the purest expression of our brand. So we'll be very careful to make sure that we're using that channel to attract a new consumer or a lapsed consumer, and we're not just taking the assortment, handing it over to a different channel and expecting and taking a margin here as a result of doing that. So it's a -- go slow in the first half to speed up as we move sequentially through the year.

And then when it comes to adjacencies, I want to just clarify what I've said. We are no longer going to invest in adjacencies. We are going to invest in our core. We have told you of 2 categories that we plan to exit in hair and men's grooming. We haven't, at this point, signaled that we are exiting whole adjacencies. We -- I actually agree with your question, what is the most thoughtful way to use the money that has been spent in these areas to potentially build this business over time, but it won't be something that we're continuing to invest in formulas, in packaging and in other ways.

We've got to get back to the core, but we aren't simply just abandoning those adjacencies. We intend to maximize the sales opportunity from those.


Eva Boratto
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And on your cash flow progression, for next year. As a reminder, and I'm sure you know this, Olivia, right, we generate all of our cash in the Q4 period. We typically like to start the year with about $500 million of cash to fund the business through the first 9 months, investing in inventory throughout the year. We're building our plans for 2026 now.

As I spoke about, there will be greater investments related to this transformation. So that could put a little bit more pressure on that first 9 months of next year, but we'll manage our cash effectively throughout the year. On the margins for our adjacencies and Amazon, in particular, it's our goal to have a comp margin structure over time. We're going to test and learn our way into this as Daniel said.


Operator

Our final question this morning comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.


Dana Telsey
Telsey Advisory Group LLC

And good to hear of the plan. As you think of the loyalty customers, which I think numbered 39 million the last time we heard, how do you break them down through the transformation strategy that you put in place and the diligence you've done? What are you seeing about that consumer? What are you learning? Who's coming, who's going? Any updates there?


Daniel Heaf
CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks. I'll start, and maybe, Eva, you can follow up with a little bit more detail. So as I've always said, our loyalty program and that loyal consumer that we have today is a competitive advantage, and we're going to continue to build on it. And in fact, I think in the recent Q, we're now up to [ 40 ] million loyalty customers. So it is a competitive advantage. We're going to continue to leverage it to drive sales, to drive building the basket of our existing consumers. Eva, maybe if I can ask you for a little bit more detail.


Eva Boratto
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Sure, sure. I think that loyalty customer, we've continued to drive the strongest retention rate. With our changes in our loyalty program, we've seen an increase in reward redemption that brings along with it an incremental spend. We're seeing good visits, good spend across all of our deciles. And the team, the marketing team, the loyalty team really continues to focus how can we continue to engage and excite those very valuable loyalty members that drive 80% of our sales.


Dana Telsey
Telsey Advisory Group LLC

Got it. And then with the reset going on, collaborations has been a big focus over the past few years. With the refocus on the core, how do you see the opportunity for collaboration? How do you maximize the strength of the product with the opportunity to enhance with sales or margins with collaborations?


Daniel Heaf
CEO & Director

Great. I appreciate the question, so I can clarify what our collaboration strategy is. So make no mistake, we love collaborations, right? They are a way to drive energy, equity and excitement and buzz into the brand. And we actually have lined up for the next [indiscernible] some really, really exciting collaborations.

But strategically, collaborations should be used to drive energy into the brand and energy into some of those franchises and collections, energy that builds everyday luxury, energy that builds White Barn Colorama, energy that builds the seasonal collection like fall, not necessarily something that sort of stands alone and is there to carry the quarter.

We don't want to get into positions where a collaboration like Villains was something that was the difference between where we guided our Q3 and where we ended our Q3. We want to use them more tactfully, more thoughtfully to drive long-term brand equity into our brands, into our franchises and into some of those iconic fragrances that I've referenced in today's call.


Operator

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Heaf for any final comments.


Daniel Heaf
CEO & Director

Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. Thank you very much for your thoughtful questions. And just let me restate, I came to Bath & Body Works to accelerate growth, and I remain absolutely confident in our ability to do so. Work to restoring our brand and achieving sustainable growth, as you've heard on today's call, is already well underway, but it will take time and focus. We've aligned our teams to the vision and the strategy, creating disruptive and innovative products, reigniting our brand, winning in the marketplace and operating with speed and efficiency to attract a new and younger consumer to the brand and unlock what I know will be the next era of growth for this brand.

You've heard today that we are driving early progress across those priorities, and we look forward to sharing more updates in the quarters ahead. I want to say a special thank you to our associates and our store teams for delivering joy this holiday season. We have the platform, we have the plan, and we absolutely have the team to win.
