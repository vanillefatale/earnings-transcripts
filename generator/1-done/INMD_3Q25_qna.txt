Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Danielle Antalffy with UBS.

Danielle Antalffy
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Congrats on a good quarter here. Just curious, Yair, as you look at the Q4, the implied Q4 guidance based on what you provided at the midpoint, you did beat Q3. So it implies a little bit of a lower Q4 number.

But I was wondering if you could level set us, sort of, as we think about the exit rate here in 2025 and look ahead to 2026, how we should be thinking about sales growth next year given the lingering uncertainties out there, I think consensus is sort of in the mid-single digit range?

Yair Malca
Chief Financial Officer

I think it is a little bit too early for us to discuss guidance 2026. We would like to see how Q4 plays out before we discuss 2026.

I think we would want to be somewhat conservative when we go into next year because of all the uncertainties, as you have mentioned. That's all I can say about 2026 at the moment.

Danielle Antalffy
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. That's totally fair. I hear you. And then just the capital equipment environment, it looks like in Q3, international was weaker, U.S. not as weak.

But in the U.S. specifically, we are in an environment now where interest rates are coming down. I mean, does this make you a little bit more optimistic as we look ahead to 2026, appreciating you want a conservative starting off point, but just maybe comments on hearing from customers? Is there increased interest now to purchase capital equipment as interest rates come down?

Yair Malca
Chief Financial Officer

So the interest rate has come down, but not enough to see that trickle in a meaningful way into the financing of the capital equipment in the U.S. as hopefully it will continue to come down, then we will start see a more meaningful impact. And then hopefully, this will translate to additional or increase in capital equipment sales.

And Moshe, go ahead.

Moshe Mizrahy
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

No. What I wanted to say, it's not just in the United States. We don't see the end -- the light at the end of the tunnel as regard to financing capital equipment, especially medical equipment to clinics.

I'm not talking about hospital and hospital is probably different. But as far as clinics who are buying capital equipment like for medical aesthetic or any other medical community, I mean, the interest rate on leasing are still very high.

I know that the interest rate went down twice in the United States, 0.5%. In Europe has not yet. So we believe that sometime in 2026, when the U.S. will lead the reduction of interest rate, it will come up to other territories, but we don't see it yet.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Matt Miksic with Barclays.

Matthew Miksic
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I had one question on the ophthalmology initiative that you've been sort of pushing forward over the last couple of years. It ran into some of your folks at AO and the general sentiment around the conference and around those specialties is significant upswing in dry eye treatment and significant interest, particularly in the optometrist channel.

I'm just wondering any color or updates you have on your strategy there, the progress, contribution, if you want to go there? And then I had one quick follow-up.

Moshe Mizrahy
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Okay. Hi, this is Moshe. Well, let me answer your question on a couple -- 2 things. One, as regard to commercial and salespeople, we are separating the salespeople for the Envision from the rest of the aesthetic and starting 2026, it will be managed by a director who is responsible only for the Envision and the sales team will sell only to Envision to optometrists and also to ophthalmologists.

We are making some progress with the American Optometrists Association. We have some agreements with them to do together some workshop in different state. And we started that at the second quarter, we continue on the third quarter and we have at least 3 events coming on the fourth quarter.

In addition to that, as far as the ophthalmology, as you probably know, we still do not have the final clearance from the FDA to say that we're treating dry eye. We hopefully will -- we're still -- we negotiated with the FDA.

I don't want to call it negotiated. It was a discussion with the FDA as regard to the protocol that we will do during the study to get the indication. We are in the last stage.

We're doing some safety tests right now on [ Revit ]. Hopefully, they will approve it before the end of the year and we will start the study next year.

It's not going to be a very long study, because you need to show some immediate effect. Hopefully, sometime towards the second quarter of 2026, we will finalize the results of the study, submit the FDA. So sometime towards the second half of 2026, we will be able to clear the indication and claim dry eye.

But right now, not only in the United States, we have enough data that show the significant competitive advantage of any other modalities that deal with dry eye and we sell it without the clearance, just because we're explaining how it's worked.

We do have the FDA clearance to the handpiece, either the Lumecca, the IPL or the bipolar RF. The 2 handpieces are already approved. So we sell it without the clear indication, but we have enough clinical data to show to the doctors and to the optometrists, they are also doctors, but they are ODs, to show them the advantage.

And we are making progress. And hopefully, next year, once we have a distinguished and separated sales team, we will show better momentum.

Matthew Miksic
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

That's very helpful. Just one, maybe zooming out to the broader business in aesthetics. Similar kind of question. When we all sort of, I think, have a sense of where you think the market is and waiting for sort of like this general sort of uptick or upswing in the cycle in the U.S.

But in terms of new products, anything that you would call out in addition to this initiative and follow-through in optometry and ophthalmology that could start to kind of drive incremental growth in, say, early first half of '26, back half of '26? Any color on the pipeline would be super helpful.

Moshe Mizrahy
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Well, we have some products coming to the -- we will launch early next year, mainly in the aesthetic, some new lasers that we bring to the market. I don't want just to reveal the type of lasers and what exactly these lasers do, but they are very complementary to our aesthetic, I would say, portfolio.

Two of them will be introduced during the national sales meeting in the U.S. sometime at the end of January '26. We will also present those 2 devices at IMCAS, which is the main conference in Europe, again, sometime in the beginning of February next year.

Yes, we currently have enough projects on the R&D pipeline, aesthetic and wellness and we will launch them 2 at a time.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from [ Caitlin Roberts ] with Canaccord Genuity.

Unknown Analyst

It's [ Michelle ] on for Caitlin. Can you maybe talk more about your rationale for picking Michael Dennison for the new role of President of North America and what he is working to drive in the early days in the new position?

Moshe Mizrahy
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. Michael worked with us for more than 10 years. And before that, he used to work for Cynosure, which is another major company in medical aesthetics. He is relatively young, in the 40s. Basically, before he took the President position, he was Vice President for the East Coast of the U.S., doing very well.

I would say the reason why we nominated him is because we didn't have -- we didn't want to have the East and West in the U.S. We want to combine all the territories under one management. And we thought Michael is the right guy to do it for InMode. And therefore, right now, we are combining all the territories under one manager, including Canada -- including Canada.

And anything else that you want to know about him? I mean, he's well known. He knows the market, he knows the doctors. He knows everything about sales and marketing, many years of experience.

As part of his taking the position of President, 2 VPs left. One was the VP West, which wanted to be a President, but we had to select only one; and also, the VP of Canada, and we're not hiring another VP for the West and VP for Canada.

We rather have some sales director in every territory. We divide the U.S. into 6 territories and Canada is the seventh one and they all report to Michael at that point.

Next year, we might appoint some other position for strategic planning and other, but we want to keep the entire North America operation under one roof.

Unknown Analyst

That's great. And maybe one more from us on urology. How did the user meeting in late August go on the urology side? And have you begun rolling out the products or seeing revenue contribution? And then any commentary or directionality you could give us for your expectations for the urology business in 2026?

Moshe Mizrahy
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Urology, I understand you mean the men wellness. Yes, I mean, the August event was a user meeting that we had in Chicago and it was with something like 800 doctors. And we introduced that with the 2 lectures and presenting some clinical data that we had at that time, which was good clinical results.

And now we are launching it and every aesthetic rep can sell this device as well. We are not separating yet. We want to see what will be the results until the end of the year and the beginning of 2026 and we'll make the decision later.

Operator

And your next question comes from Sam Eiber with BTIG.

Unknown Analyst

It's [ Alex ] on for Sam. So I just had a quick question on the OUS business. And so you mentioned that you guys opened a new subsidiary in Argentina this quarter and also have been expanding your efforts in Thailand.

So can you just talk more about the strength in OUS this quarter? And how can we think about it moving forward?

Moshe Mizrahy
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

You mean about the 2 subsidiaries that we opened this year?

Unknown Analyst

And just OUS in general, like what are the trends there? Like how should we think about it, like for the end of the year and going into like '26? Like will it be more of the same or different?

Moshe Mizrahy
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Okay. If you're talking about OUS in general, currently, we have -- we're selling in 88 to 90 countries, out of which in Europe, we have 5 subsidiaries that cover 10 countries, Italy; Spain that cover Portugal as well; Germany cover Austria as well; France is covering Belgium as well; and U.K. is covering Ireland and Scotland. So these are all direct operations that we have in those countries, something like 10 countries.

In Asia, we have 4 countries: Australia, India, Japan and the new established Thailand. And we are currently not planning to -- in 2025, we are not planning to add more countries, not in Europe and not in Asia.

The only one country that we have direct right now in Latin America is Argentina. And the base we build in Argentina is also responsible to manage all the distributors in Latin America.

As far as managing the distributors in EMEA, Europe, Middle East and Africa, we have a base in London with the VP sitting there and he is responsible for all of this area.

In North America, you know we have Michael Dennison managing all the North American operations, Canada and the U.S.

And Israel is also a country where we are considering now going direct. We used to have 2 distributors, but we want to go direct starting 2026, because it's a home base and we want to sell direct here. It's important for us.

I don't know which country will develop in 2026 to become direct operation. We have not yet decided. We have several alternatives and we're exploring several opportunities, but we are just now focusing in the last 2 that we established in the last 6 months.

Operator

And your next question comes from Mike Matson with Needham.

Unknown Analyst

This is [ Joseph ] on for Mike. I guess apologies if this was already asked, as I hopped on from a different call. But just looking at noninvasive growth, obviously, you guys had a really large quarter in the second quarter and dropped back down this quarter.

I'm just kind of wondering how should we think about the lumpiness of this division? Is it -- was there just large orders in the second quarter and it's more stabilized from here out? Yes. Any color there would be helpful.

Moshe Mizrahy
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

You mean on the noninvasive and non-ablative. That's correct?

Unknown Analyst

Yes.

Moshe Mizrahy
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Okay. Let me say something before. I would say that except 1 or 2 platforms that we sell, almost every platform that we sell has at least one invasive or ablative handpiece, either Morpheus body face or the Ignite or the BodyTite.

What we sell noninvasive, it's what we call the commodity type product like all the other competitors, diode laser, IPL, noninvasive RF, hands-free devices.

We don't have -- we have a competitive advantage in this field and we would like it to grow, because we want to be one-stop shop to every doctor. So if the doctor needs a complementary technology to our minimally invasive and ablative, we wanted to buy from us.

So this is -- and currently, we are developing some new lasers which are noninvasive. So this doesn't mean that we are now doing only things that are ablative and invasive. Everything is getting the same attention and we're developing the noninvasive as well.

I don't know if I answered your question, but I believe that...

Yair Malca
Chief Financial Officer

I would like to add that this year, Joseph, we -- the 2 new products that we added happened to be noninvasive, the CO2 that we added in the beginning of the year and men health that we added after.

So this is the reason for the increase that you see in the noninvasive category for us.

Unknown Analyst

I see. So just a lot of orders for customers that were waiting for those new platforms and a lot of that was realized in the second quarter. No, that's helpful.

And then maybe just one quick one, just touching on the consumables growth. I'm curious how many handpieces you guys sold in the quarter and just how you're thinking about growth there in procedures.

Moshe Mizrahy
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

In the third quarter of 2025, we sold about 230,000 disposable, which means onetime use tips, either for minimally invasive or ablative.

Unknown Analyst

Okay. Great. That's helpful. So it looks like a sequential increase in the quarter. Okay. Yes. That's all very helpful.

Operator

This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Moshe Mizrahy, InMode's CEO, for any closing remarks.

Moshe Mizrahy
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Thank you, operator, and thank you, everybody, who attended this call. I want to thank the InMode team, especially in all the territories. And we hope that the fourth quarter, as always, will be the strongest one and we're looking forward to 2026. Thank you very much.

Operator

The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.
