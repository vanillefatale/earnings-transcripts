Question-and-Answer Session

Certainly, we will go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.

Erik Woodring
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Congrats on the results. Tim, can you maybe share a bit more detail on why you think the iPhone 17 is having the degree of success that it is at this point? And really, the question is do you believe this is the aged installed base replacement cycle kicking in or are there specific features or functionality you believe stand out this cycle versus past cycles that consumers are really looking for. And then just a quick follow-up.

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

Erik, thanks for your comments. I think it's all about the product. The product lineup is incredibly strong, our strongest ever. The 17 Pro is the most pro phone we've ever done. It's incredible in the design things. The iPhone Air is -- feels so thin and so light in your hand. It feels like it's going to fly away. And then the 17 phone is an incredible value and takes several of the features that were reserved for Pro before and brings them down to the consumer lineup. So overall, strongest iPhone lineup ever, and it's resonating around the world.

Erik Woodring
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. And maybe a follow-up for you, Kevan. Can you maybe just discuss your approach to managing component cost inflation during this time? You're obviously increasing the memory content in your devices quite substantially. At the same time, memory prices are going through some pretty significant inflation. So just how are you managing through this cycle?

Kevan Parekh
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Erik, thanks for the question. Look, as you know, we've got a pretty incredible world-class procurement team as we're constantly finding ways to continue to drive cost opportunities. Right now on the commodity side, I would say we're seeing a slight tailwind on memory in storage prices and nothing really to note there. And as we saw from our gross margin performance, we landed in a pretty good spot above the high end of the guidance range we provided at 47.2% and as well, we're guiding at 47% to 48%.

So I think we're managing costs pretty well. As you'll recall, when we talked about this time in the cycle, we just launched a bunch of new products. Those new products do have a slightly higher cost structure than the products they replace, but the team does a very good job of focusing our efforts on getting those costs down over time. And we feel pretty good about the performance we're seeing right now overall on material cost savings.

Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research.

Benjamin Reitzes
Melius Research LLC

Tim, can you talk a little bit about iPhone in China specifically? How is that going to trend in the December quarter? And have you turned the corner there? And how do you think that trajectory is going? And then I have a quick follow-up.

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

Yes. Ben, I was just there. It's incredibly vibrant and dynamic. The store traffic is up significantly year-over-year. The iPhone 17 has been -- the family has been very well received there. We do believe that we'll return to growth in Q1, and that is largely based on the reception of the iPhone there. And so I couldn't be more pleased with how things are going there in the early going.

Benjamin Reitzes
Melius Research LLC

All right. That's great. And then Services, great upside there, a little surprising, right? We were a little worried about that one only a few quarters ago. I was wondering if there were any tax payments in there or if the resolution that we saw with the antitrust ruling with one of your partners was a boost and if that played a role or if it was all really just organic outperformance with many of the things you mentioned.

Kevan Parekh
Senior VP & CFO

Ben, it's Kevan here. Let me try to answer that question. You're referring -- I just wanted to clarify, when you're referring to the antitrust piece, you're talking about the Google trial. Is that what you're referring to?

Benjamin Reitzes
Melius Research LLC

Yes. Yes, sir.

Kevan Parekh
Senior VP & CFO

Okay. Yes, there was no tax-related impact. And what I would say is our strong performance for the quarter is really organically driven. And again, just to reiterate, we had an all-time revenue record here for the quarter at $28.8 billion and as well, we surpassed $100 billion, so best year ever at 14% year-on-year. So really, that was all organic growth. As Tim outlined and I outlined in the prepared remarks, we saw a majority of the categories have sequential acceleration, and we had many all-time revenue records. But nothing abnormal at all, really pretty much all organic growth.

Operator

Our next question is from Michael Ng.

Michael Ng
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I just have 2 as well. First, just to follow up on the last one. The services revenue growth, I think, was the fastest across many categories and certainly the fastest in the last 2 years. I was just wondering if you could just unpack a little bit more the drivers of the acceleration. Was there kind of cross-selling with the new iPhone launch? Was it just installed base growth? I know you've been doing a lot of bundling with Apple One and AppleCare One. So any thoughts on that would be very helpful. And then I just have a quick follow-up.

Kevan Parekh
Senior VP & CFO

Michael, it's Kevan. Thanks for the question. Yes, let me build on the answer there. I think that the way we look at it is not one thing to point to that would have driven this higher performance. You're right that it is slightly higher than we've seen in the last few quarters. But as you know, our Services portfolio is very broad with a broad range of businesses, all that have different growth profiles and different performance characteristics, so those can vary in any given quarter. I would say our strength, again, was very broad-based, both across categories and also geographically. So I wouldn't point to any particular factor that drove any kind of outperformance at all. We were just very pleased to see that result.

Michael Ng
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Great. And just on iPhone sell-through, I was wondering if you were seeing any notable shifts in trends between the sell-through coming from upgraders versus switchers? Is the U.S. carrier competitive dynamic helping at all in terms of promotional activity? And any thoughts on channel inventory?

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

Okay. We did set a September quarter record for upgraders, and so it was a great quarter from that point of view. It's really too early in the cycle on 17 to make any comments about upgraders or switchers. In terms of channel inventory, we ended the quarter toward the low end of the targeted range. Obviously, because we had constraints on the -- on several models of the 16 and 17. And for complete transparency and clarity, we're constrained today on several models of the iPhone 17. There's not a ramp issue. It's just we have very strong demand, and we're working very hard to fulfill all the orders that we have.

Operator

Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.

Amit Daryanani
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I have 2 as well. I guess, Kevan, maybe just start with gross margins. Can you just walk through the expectations for the December quarter? I think it implies up 30 basis points or so sequentially. Can you just talk about the puts and takes on gross margin given you do have very sizable operating leverage in the quarter? So just maybe what are the puts and takes around that would be really helpful.

Kevan Parekh
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, sure, Amit, let me walk through the outlook. As we mentioned in our outlook, we are targeting a range of 47% to 48%. You take the midpoint of that range at 47.5%. You said it's roughly 25 basis points, 30 basis points higher. Really, there's a lot of puts and takes. As I talked about earlier, this is a quarter we launched a lot of new products. Those new products tend to have a higher cost structure than the products they replace. So there's definitely an impact from the cost side of thing, but that was more than offset by favorable mix, especially on the product side as well, as you outlined, we typically see higher leverage in this quarter. So I would say those are the 2 big drivers. And so the sequential increase is really going to be driven by favorable mix particularly from the product side.

Amit Daryanani
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. And then if I just go back to the China discussion for a minute, the performance in China, at least in the September quarter, was a bit muted. Could you just talk about what resulted in the weakness over there? And do you think it was a bit more of a pause given iPhone Air, for example, I don't think was available until a few weeks ago? So just somewhat what drove the weakness in September? And is the uptick of that expectation for December there just from the iPhone Air coming out? Or are there other factors as well?

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

Yes. The Greater China revenue was down 4% in the -- year-over-year in the September quarter. It was driven by iPhone and if you look at the iPhone, the majority of the sequential year-over-year change was due to supply constraints that I mentioned earlier. And so it was basically supply constraints that drove the results. We're thrilled with what we're seeing right now. With traffic being up significantly year-over-year and the reception of the 17 family, we expect to return to growth this quarter.

Operator

Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.

Wamsi Mohan
BofA Securities, Research Division

Tim, if I can follow up on your comments about the constrained supply in the quarter just given the very strong demand for iPhones, do you expect that as you can see your visibility across demand and supply, do you think that you will be exiting December at a point where you wouldn't be constrained anymore? Or do you still expect that there could be constraints as you exit the December quarter? And any way to quantify sort of what revenue could have been in this quarter without constraints?

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

Yes. If you look at the supply constraints, today, we are constrained on several 17 models. We're not predicting when the supply/demand will balance. We're obviously working very hard to achieve that because we want to get as many of these products out to the customers as possible. But today, I'm not going to predict.

Wamsi Mohan
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. Okay. And then as a follow-up, I heard you talk about new records across a lot of categories and services. I didn't hear search explicitly called out. So maybe it's a little bit of a follow-up to Ben's question. But given that there are some concerns around search volumes decelerating at the expense of AI, how do you think about the broader sustainability of these very strong mid-teens growth rates for Services over an extended period of time, not just for next quarter where you're obviously guiding to 14%?

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

This is Tim. The advertising category, which is a combination of third party and first party did set a record during the quarter.

Wamsi Mohan
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. And sorry, just to be clear, both Apple's own internal advertising and within the licensing individually set records?

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

Actually, I'm not saying that. I'm just saying that the combination of the 2 set a record. We don't -- I'm dodging the question intentionally because we don't split it at that level.

Operator

Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.

Samik Chatterjee
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Maybe for the first one, Tim, you talked about the strong momentum you're seeing in China, which is also driving your confidence for the December quarter. Any thoughts on the role that the smartphone subsidies in that region are playing in this momentum? And how do you think about sort of what portion of consumers are maybe using some of those subsidies, leveraging the subsidies at this point? Any more insights into that? And I have a follow-up.

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

Yes, the subsidies play a favorable role. The subsidies, as you know, are sort of across multiple categories from PCs to tablets, smartwatches and smartphones and -- however, it's important to note, they only apply to certain price ranges. And so there's a maximum price, and there are several of our products that are -- that sell above that price and therefore, are not eligible for a subsidy. And -- but it does have a favorable effect, and it's clearly and at least from our vantage point, driving some consumer demand.

Samik Chatterjee
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Okay. Got it. And a follow-up for Kevan here. On the OpEx increase going into the December quarter, a fairly sizable step-up. So if you could just dig into that number a bit more, what are sort of the components towards what you're spending? And then that increase year-over-year in OpEx does sort of exceed your revenue growth. So is that sort of what we should expect on a going forward basis as well where you probably need to invest a bit more in the near future?

Kevan Parekh
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Samik, thanks for that question. As we've been outlining and reiterated in our last call, we are increasing our investments in AI. We're also continuing to invest in our product road map. So the vast majority of the increase to our operating expenses are driven by R&D.

While we continue to manage the company in a thoughtful and disciplined way, we're also managing the business for the long term and are super excited about all the opportunities that we see ahead. As it relates to the question around OpEx and revenue growth, while OpEx has been growing at a faster rate than revenue, we have seen gross margin expansion. And so when we look at that, on a combined basis, it does allow us to have healthy operating leverage, and our operating income growth has been generally outpacing revenue growth for the past several years.

Operator

Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS.

David Vogt
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So maybe, Kevan, can I ask first, can you help us understand sort of the tariff impact sequentially from the September quarter to the December quarter, particularly around iPhone supply constraints? Because I think I heard you say tariffs go from $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion, but the sequential uplift in iPhone revenue and presumably production given supply chain constraints is dramatically bigger. So you -- can you help us understand how to think about the timing of those tariff headwinds as we move forward and sort of that correlation? And then I have a follow-up.

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

David, I'll take this one. You're right, it goes from $1.1 billion to a projection of $1.4 billion. And the $1.4 billion is based on sort of what we know right now and where the tariff rates and policies and so forth are. So it assumes a stable kind of environment for the quarter. It does comprehend the change that was just made, which we're very encouraged to see with the tariffs moving from 20% to 10% in China. And so that is factored in, and that is one of the reasons why the -- it's not linear to volume if you will. Does that make sense?

David Vogt
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Got it. No, that's helpful. That's what I was asking, if the change is reflected in that outlook. And then just as a follow-up, when you think about -- I think on the Macs, I know people aren't asking about it. You talked about the tough comp, but you're going into sort of a holiday season, and I understand that. But when you think about the attached possibility for other products to the iPhone in the holiday season, how do we think about sort of where the consumers' heads that and their wallet is at this point in the cycle? And granted it is a tough comp, but is there an opportunity to see some maybe upside from an attach rate perspective given the strength in the iPhone portfolio?

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

We always like to remind people that buy an iPhone all the other things that we offer, and so you can bet that we're doing that. From a Mac point of view, the challenge is that last year was sort of the mother of all Mac launches. All of these from Mac mini to iMac to all the MacBook Pros, all launched literally at the same time. And this year, that compares to launching the 14-inch MacBook Pro. And so there's a very difficult compare. Of course, in the long run, I'm very bullish on the Mac, and you can see that the Mac again last quarter outgrew the market. And so we feel really well about how Mac is positioned, but this certain quarter is an extremely difficult compare.

Kevan Parekh
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And Tim, I'll add to that, that we also have the DRAM upgrades last year for the Mac lineup, also was another factor.

Operator

Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.

Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan
TD Cowen, Research Division

My first one is on the iPhone constraints. Is there a way to quantify how much business you left on the table because of those constraints? And is the different iPhone manufacturing from 2 different regions contributing to the constraint? And then I have a follow-up for you.

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

To be clear, the constraint was not related to manufacturing capacity per se. It was that we called the number of iPhone 16s that we were going to make, and we're a bit short of where the demand really was. So we could have sold more. We're not publicly at least estimating the extent of that. And then on iPhone 17 family, it's -- the demand is very strong, and so we obviously came out of the Q4 time frame with lots of back orders.

Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan
TD Cowen, Research Division

Got it. And then a quick follow-up. Given like the prevalence of chatbots and now some of these AI-infused web services, do you think that could change the consumer behavior on mobile app ecosystems? Or are you seeing any of that? And would that have any impact on your App Store?

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

I think there are opportunities on the App Store with artificial intelligence. And so I think as we have made our on-device models available for developers and we've seen developers begin to adopt them and so I think as you -- as that proliferates, there's an opportunity to -- for developers and for Apple to benefit from that, from adding features to their apps and so forth.

Operator

Our next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.

Aaron Rakers
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I had 2 as well. I guess the first question is when we look at the iPhone 17 demand, which you've repeatedly highlighted is very strong, I'm curious if there's been any discernible kind of change in the mix within the iPhone 17 categories between the Pro and the Pro Max versions relative to prior cycles.

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

It's really too early to call the mix to be honest, and we don't like to publicly disclose that because of -- for competitive reasons. But frankly, we don't really know what the mix will be yet because we have constraints on both sides of the ledger at the top and at the entry. And so we'll see what happens as we get more supply.

Aaron Rakers
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Yes. And then as a quick follow-up, I'm curious, as we kind of work through kind of the AI narrative that continues to build. Is there -- could you provide any kind of updated thoughts around the build-out of Apple's private compute cloud and how we should think about that kind of as we look forward?

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

Yes. We're obviously using PCC, our Private Cloud Compute, today for a number of queries for Siri, and we will continue to build it out. In fact, the manufacturing plant that makes the servers used for Apple Intelligence just started manufacturing in Houston a few weeks ago, and we've got a ramp plan there for use in our data centers and it's robust.

Kevan Parekh
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Aaron, I'll add maybe there, too, since you asked a question about Private Cloud Compute that we -- in '25, we did have CapEx costs associated with building out our Private Cloud Compute environment in our first-party data centers. So you would have seen that in some of the CapEx investment in the year.

Operator

Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi.

Atif Malik
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Great execution. The first question is on iPhone Air. Does the consumer reception on iPhone Air gives you a feel on perhaps the foldable phone market? Or are the 2 form factors very different?

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

I'm not sure that they're -- that one is a proxy for the other. The thing that I would say is that we're -- we don't get into the model kind of demand. At the aggregate level, we are thrilled with how iPhone has been received, and that's the reason that we're expecting double-digit growth in the current quarter.

Atif Malik
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Great. And Tim, as a follow-up, good to know that the personalized Siri is making good progress and on track for next year. Will you continue to use a three-pronged approach with your own foundation models and partner with other LLM providers and maybe potential M&A? Or is one strategy more emphasized over another?

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

We're obviously creating Apple foundation models within Apple. We ship them on device and use them in the Private Cloud Compute as well. And we've got several in development. And so we also, from a -- continually to surveil the market on M&A and are open to pursuing M&A if we think that it will advance our road map.

Operator

Our last question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research.

Richard Kramer
Arete Research Services LLP

Tim, we've often seen Apple be a fast follower with iPhone and new technology, whether large displays or 4G or 5G. But with all the hype now around AI, are you seeing evidence that AI capabilities or features are a material purchase consideration for consumers or the record sales levels you're reporting simply reflecting other factors like the retention of your iOS base?

Timothy Cook
CEO & Director

I think that there are many factors that influence people's purchasing considerations and so -- and we don't have a great in-depth survey yet on the current iPhone 17 because it's very new in the cycle, and we give it some time to formulate. But I would say that Apple Intelligence is a factor, and we're very bullish on it becoming a greater factor. And so that's the way that we look at it.

Richard Kramer
Arete Research Services LLP

Okay. And then one for Kevan. In the wake of nearly every other large tech company massively increasing their CapEx in advance of AI demand and also mentioning that there's scarce capacity, do you anticipate Apple altering its sort of long-standing hybrid approach to your own and third-party data centers? And maybe can you talk a little bit about the role you see for Apple silicon with the new M5 series of chipsets?

Kevan Parekh
Senior VP & CFO

Richard, thanks for the question. In general, I think as we've talked about before, we are expecting increases in our CapEx spending related to AI investments. For example, as I mentioned earlier, we did end up having investments this year to build out our Private Cloud Compute environment. And we do believe this hybrid model has served us very well, and we continue to want to leverage it. And so I don't see us moving away from this hybrid model where we leverage both first-party capacity as well as leverage third-party capacity. We'll continue to want to build out Private Cloud Compute, as Tim outlined, as we have more usage there over time. But I think, in general, we want to continue to have this hybrid model.
