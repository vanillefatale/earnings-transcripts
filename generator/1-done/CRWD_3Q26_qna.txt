[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Brian Essex with JPMorgan.

Brian Essex
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Nice results. And Andy, congratulations on the new role. Maybe for George, great to hear the acceleration in the endpoint segment of the business. And I know you guys aren't giving any update until year-end on the emerging segments of the business. But could you offer a little bit of color of how those segments are behaving as you kind of lap the initial CCP initiatives of last year?

And then maybe for George -- I mean, maybe for Burt, I know you're not offering any kind of impact from Pangea and Onum on ARR, but any sense of the seasonality, organic seasonality for net new ARR?

George Kurtz
Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director

Yes. Brian, thanks. Yes, when we look at, obviously, the emerging products, which was the heart of your question, they performed fantastic. If you look at Next-Gen SIEM, it's been an all-star standout for us. We've seen just incredible results from a customer perspective and what they're able to do and driving down the cost and get better outcomes.

Identity as well, that's key to the -- securing AI in an enterprise. And then obviously, cloud, we talked about some of the big wins throughout the quarter. So when we look at those segments, and as you mentioned, we'll be reporting out on those next quarter, we're very, very pleased on the results and customers are embracing the technology and the consolidation the single platform delivers. So from that standpoint, I think we're very happy.

And then as we lap the CCP, CCP was designed to do exactly what we delivered, right? We helped customers through a situation. And also, we provided a way to accelerate Flex adoption, and we've seen that with our Flex license adoption throughout the quarter, which we called out. And then obviously, we had a fantastic endpoint quarter, which continues to help drive all the other modules. So overall, I couldn't be happier with the quarter that we just put up.

Burt Podbere
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And on your question with respect to Pangea, I think that I called out that we have got a de minimis impact from both a revenue standpoint and net new ARR. And we're excited that those are going to roll into the platform in Q4. So that's how we think about it.

Your next question will come from Saket Kalia with Barclays.

Saket Kalia
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great quarter, and congrats, Andy. George, maybe for you. I just want to pick up on your comment earlier on SIEM. It feels like the SIEM market is starting to see more velocity of displacements. Can you just maybe talk about what sort of value you're able to capture in those opportunities compared to what customers were maybe spending before? And then maybe relatedly, how do you kind of think about the timetable for legacy SIEM renewals in the coming quarters, years, which, of course, I imagine you'd be targeting?

George Kurtz
Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director

Yes. So I'll try to wrap this up into one answer here. But Saket, let me just kind of lay this out, if you look at the journey that we've been on and how we've been able to replace legacy AV, it feels a lot like that market in the early days when we think about replacing legacy SIEM, customers are looking for better outcomes. They're looking for faster results, and they're looking for lower cost. And because we already have the EDR data in the platform, we can offer disruptive pricing versus our competitors. The most -- the stickiest data that's out there is the EDR data, we already have it.

And really, what it becomes is a journey to activate Next-Gen SIEM for our customers. So when we think about the opportunity to work with customers and how we get in and the opportunity going forward, keep in mind, all of our customers are Next-Gen SIM enabled, all of our customers are Next-Gen SIM enabled. It's a huge difference between us and everyone else in the marketplace. And all we need to do is go through the licensing exercise, and Flex is helping to accelerate that. So we can offer competitive disruptive pricing and then overall grow our total wallet share with the customer over time. So it's a multiyear long-tail journey that feels very similar to the displacement of legacy AV.

Your next question will come from Matt Hedberg with RBC.

Matthew Hedberg
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Congrats from me as well on the quarter and Andy to you as well. George, building on your Next-Gen SIEM success and Onum and a little bit related to Saket's question, do you see a further push into observability? Obviously, there's been some movement with some of your cyber competitors to go deeper into observability. Just curious on kind of how you view that market? And is that a consolidation opportunity for you as well?

George Kurtz
Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director

Well, we do view it as a consolidation opportunity. And I'll remind everyone on the call that when we acquired Humio, which became LogScale, 50% of their business was actually in observability. So we have all of the technology. And in fact, because the platform is collecting so much data and so much telemetry, we have customers today that are using it for observability use cases. You combine that with our agent technology, which does deep inspection within its platform. And we have data that goes well beyond security data that is already being consumed by customers.

And then you combine that with Onum, the pipelining technology, the data fabric, which again has the ability to take IT data. And we have a fantastic opportunity in front of us to consolidate in those areas, which, again, this is nothing new to us, we've actually been doing this. And this has been part of our selling motion as well as what customers are embracing. So it's already there, and there's certainly more that we can do and certainly more we will do.

Your next question will come from Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs.

Gabriela Borges
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Question for Burt. So CrowdStrike has years and years of data on customer cohorts and how your customer cohorts typically expand with you over time. You've now got several quarters of data on Flex and how the Flex customers expand with you over time. There's a piece of this which is structural, which is you're making it easier for customers to consolidate with you. But I'm wondering if there's also a dynamic where you see an elevated tailwind to NRR for a period of time because of Flex and Flex starting with your best and most excited customers and then perhaps normalizes lower. So my question for you is how do you think about that dynamic? How do you think about the tailwind that Flex is driving in the model and how sustainable that is?

Burt Podbere
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Gabriela. So the way I think about this is our Flex licensing, it's continuous. Net ARR will be continuous throughout time. And the beauty of this whole program is that it's designed for customers to easily buy more. So over time, we're excited about the opportunity as we bring more products to market and offer more availability to our customers easily. And I think that's the biggest piece that everybody on the call should just remember is that, that's exactly what Flex was designed to do, make it easier for customers to buy, make it very easier for us to be able to deploy and be able to give value and lower TCO. That's how we think about it.

And the benefit is that we're seeing bigger deals and longer deals. And that's all good for us, and it's great for the customers. And I think the most important thing is and not get lost in things I've just said is consolidation. We started this company talking about consolidation, the ability for customers to do more with us, spend more with us and lower their total TCO but spending more with us. So I think that's the biggest point that I want to drive home.

Operator

Your next question will come from Dan Ives with Wedbush.

Daniel Ives
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

And also congrats on the Mercedes deal, George. Can you just talk about AI? Like as you're starting to see more and more deployments, talk about how that's changing the conversations with customers, even over the last 3, 6, 9 months relative to where CrowdStrike sits. Can you maybe just give some insight into how those have changed from your perspective?

George Kurtz
Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director

Yes. Great. Thanks, Dan. Thanks, as always. Yes, when we think about the conversation of AI, what customers have realized is that CrowdStrike is probably the only company in security that's moved beyond chatbots. And what I mean by that is Charlotte AI and its related agents are deeply embedded into the platform. At our last Fal.Con in Europe, we talked about 11 AI agents and AgentWorks, which allows our customers to actually create their own security agents, which we think is going to be a massive opportunity for us.

So it's moved from chatbots to actual doing work, and this is something that we continually hear differentiates us from our competitors. Our competitors are still stuck on chatbots where we've done the orchestration within the platform. We've created models around each of our modules, and we're delivering results. Things that would take 4 days of work, we're delivering in minutes for customers.

And at the various events that I was at both in Las Vegas for Fal.Con and in Europe for our Fal.Con in Europe, our customers talk about just the evolution of Charlotte, the maturation of it and how it's become a key part of their success in their SOC. And it gets back to what I said earlier, CrowdStrike has become the operating system for the SOC and Charlotte is a big piece of it.

Your next question will come from Joseph Gallo with Jefferies.

Joseph Gallo
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Congrats, Andy, on the new role. It was awesome to see you guys maintain the fiscal '27 net new ARR growth of 20% on higher numbers. You mentioned several key components of the business accelerated in 3Q. Is there 1 or 2 products that you think have an outsized growth impact for upside next year? And then as a part of that, security for AI feels necessary but very early. Is that accounted for in your preliminary fiscal '27 guidance? Or is that more longer term?

George Kurtz
Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director

Yes, sure. So I think when we look at next year, again, seeing the momentum that we talked about with Next-Gen SIEM, again, it's an all-star product. It delivers a lot of value, which is key in this market when you're talking about consolidation. And it's enabling customers to do things that they haven't been able to do.

And I think one of the areas that maybe is really not appreciated is that many organizations of all sizes are making a decision in the past to not collect certain data because of the cost. With CrowdStrike, we can actually open the aperture, and we can provide value to collect all that data. So in general, we're expanding the wallet share, but we're giving them more value because we're collecting data they've never seen, and we're giving them outcomes that weren't available to them previously.

So I would look at that as an all-star. I would look at cloud. We look at the displacements that we talked about in the call. We looked about -- we talked about the runtime protection, which is key. Customers want that protection. And then we look at Falcon Shield, which is, again, cloud and identity, but it is a key technology to help protect the SaaS applications. So these are all fantastic opportunities for us in the coming year, and we'll continue to double down on them.

Your next question will come from Fatima Boolani with Citi.

Fatima Boolani
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Here I go. George, I wanted to direct this to you. You gave us a lot of information about your strengthening partnership with AWS. And your proximity to AWS for customer and a very, very strategic partner has only cemented further. So I wanted to ask you a very high-level strategic question. This proximity that preclude you or influence you or potentially maybe even complicate your relationship with other hyperscalers and your customers who would typically presumably have multi-cloud infrastructure footprints. I would love for you to sort of dive into some of those dynamics a little bit, again, just by virtue of the strengthening partnership with AWS and the availability of the full Falcon suite in a very deep integrated way inside AWS.

George Kurtz
Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director

Yes. So first, we couldn't be more excited about this partnership. And really, I mean, I think this is something that's going to be incredible for AWS customers as well as customers at CrowdStrike and the fact that now natively, you can actually flow data from AWS into Next-Gen SIEM. It's right in your console, and it's going to be a tremendous enabler for new customer acquisition. And it's a needed technology for AWS customers. So overall, a fantastic relationship, and we're excited to be deeply integrated.

And when we think about the current environment, as you know, there's always an area to cooperate with many different companies that are out there. Just look at the AI space and how many people work with different companies that are out there. I think if you look at that and you apply it to security, of course, we're going to work with other players that are out there. They're going to leverage the best technology in the market, which is CrowdStrike. And we're there to support all of our customers and potential partners. So it doesn't preclude us from doing that. But again, I think this reinforces what a great relationship we have with AWS, how we've been able to partner with them, not only in the technology side, but also in the marketplace. And you've seen the evidence of that by the awards that I called out. So overall, extremely excited about what the future brings.

Your next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.

Meta Marshall
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. You noted core EDR acceleration in the quarter and you kind of noted AI as a catalyst for that. But just is that kind of more endpoints getting protected or as they become more intelligent or just existing customers looking to modernize as part of general AI adoption?

George Kurtz
Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director

Sure. When you think about endpoints and the adoption of AI, a lot of it takes place at the endpoint. Think about all of the various technologies that are out there where people are running these as a user on their endpoints. And we've seen some big announcements from consulting firms and others that are leveraging AI in their business because they have to and they have to drive efficiencies.

So what that means is that, that creates opportunities and exposure for companies. So they're going to need to monitor what sort of queries go in. They're going to need to monitor what data comes out. They're going to need to monitor what other services are connected into those AI desktop technologies, and that becomes another threat vector. So this becomes a catalyst. Again, I think this is underappreciated as a new risk vector that we hadn't had over the last number of years. Now with the adoption of this, this isn't AI creation, it's AI adoption. And that, I believe, is going to be a massive market opportunity for us. So that's where we see that. And overall, as I always say, 50% of the market is still legacy AV, and there's still a long runway in the endpoint business to be able to take that legacy market share.

Your next question will come from Patrick Colville with Scotiabank.

Patrick Edwin Colville
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

All right. I guess this one is for George. I want to ask about discounting levels because if I think about this time last year, we had the CCP program, but we also had CrowdStrike very correctly being aggressive to cement and extend its position through discounting. That was the right strategy, and these results prove that. But as I think about the quarter we've just had, fiscal 3Q and as we look towards fiscal '27, I guess, can you just talk about how you're thinking about just discounting and normal course of business discounting? Are those levels going to diminish over time as we have the Falcon outage further and further in the rearview mirror and your position is looking very strong?

George Kurtz
Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director

Sure. Well, I think when you look at this market and you look at, say, enterprise sales, I mean, there's always some level of discounting. That's not unique to us. It's not unique to security, and it's not unique to software companies. It just happens as a normal course of business. And I think we've been very prudent in how we operate in those areas. And we've tried to focus on things like CCP, which again, allow customers to take new technologies in, but protect the price point and allow us to basically capture them in a flex opportunity.

So we're going to use the tools available to us to be competitive. We continue to take share. We continue to drive new customer business. And we don't see anything out of normal course of business, but we've got various tools in our toolbox, and we tend to use those judiciously and again, where it makes sense for us and for the customer, and that just drives the growth that you've seen. And I'll also point out the 81% gross margin, like you have to look at the margin as well. And we've been able to be successful, and we've been able to protect the margin.

Your next question will come from Eric Heath with KeyBanc.

Eric Heath
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Nice set of results. George, I wanted to ask about the partnership with F5. I thought that was pretty interesting. But correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe this part of the infrastructure stack historically was never able to support endpoint agents before. So does this expand the endpoint TAM? How meaningful can this be? And are there other areas of the infrastructure stack you think this is applicable to?

George Kurtz
Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director

Yes. This is a great and insightful question. I'm really glad that you asked it because it does. And what we've seen over the years is that customers have been asking for a long time to protect these appliances. And in many cases, the appliances has not been available to us, the underlying operating system, if you will, to be able to protect, but there's been a huge demand there.

So we worked with F5 in great partnership and very quickly to be able to certify our agent to run on their platform. And we do think that this will create a model, working model that will open it up to other appliance vendors to be able to have it protected. And I can tell you just some anecdotal stories. There was a story just last week of a noncustomer never used CrowdStrike, had the opportunity to actually use our technology because of F5 and was blown away. And within a week, we had them in an EBC, and now we're getting into a proof of value.

So this play works, and we're going to expand our market and be very forward leaning in being able to protect other appliances that are out there, which you probably have seen are the tip of the spear for many of these nation-state breaches.

Your next question will come from Roger Boyd with UBS.

Roger Boyd
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Well, congrats, Andy, on the new role. I wanted to double-click on the Kroll partnership. I know MSP has been a growing part of the channel for CrowdStrike for the past couple of quarters. Can you walk us through that longer-term opportunity as you expand with Kroll and other -- beyond kind of the initial endpoint landing spot?

George Kurtz
Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director

Sure. Yes. We are excited about this opportunity. We took out another EDR vendor that was in there. We're providing a much better solution for them and their customers. And they're in a segment that allows us to bring our technology to. There's a lot of incident response engagements they're doing. They're part of the insurance panels. And it opens up a market opportunity with one customer and just accelerates our ability to penetrate that.

So these are the type of models that we like to create. We've been very successful in the MSSP market. This is just another proof point of us working with customers like Kroll and the reach that they have and the trust that they have. So the idea is to create more Kroll opportunities and certainly grow the opportunity that we have with Kroll, which I feel very confident we will.

Your next question will come from Tal Liani with BofA.

Tal Liani
BofA Securities, Research Division

I'm trying -- you're a $5 billion revenue company and you only provide one number, revenue or ARR. There's no breakdown. So I'm trying to understand a little bit of the kind of any segmentation of your revenues. And the question I have is, can you discuss verticals like contribution of SMB and trends in SMB, kind of new market opportunities that were not in your core before and how you're addressing them? And also new customers versus upsell to existing customers. Are you disclosing NRR and GRR? I know you stopped doing it a few quarters ago.

Burt Podbere
Chief Financial Officer

Actually, let me take the last part of your question first. So basically, we are going to be giving out dollar-based net retention and gross retention rates at the end of the year. So that's what we've talked about, and we will do that, Tal at, the end of Q4. So -- and we do it every Q4. So I think you'll be -- you'll get that information.

Now with respect to breaking out how we think about our business, whether it's enterprise or SMB or MSSP, the great news about our business is that we sell all of it. We're successful with all of it. We're successful with small deals. We're successful with large enterprise deals. And for us, we have that great technology that it's the same. It's the same technology for if you're a 5-person shop or you're the largest company in the world. And the beauty of how we're able to deliver our technology is that it's up and running in seconds.

So when you think about segmentation, you think about who we sell to, it really is everybody. Our ability and our success is agnostic. We are really driving new wins and displacing competitors on a daily basis, right? And for us, to continue to invest in the business and for us to be able to continue to make sure that we're able to deliver in a very timely manner, these are the successful things that we look at to be able to sell to all of our customers, whether big or small. So we're excited about that. And we're also rare in the entire security community to be able to do that successfully.

Your next question will come from Mike Cikos with Needham.

John Jeffrey Hopson
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

This is Jeff Hopson on for Mike. With the increased amount of M&A activity in security we've seen this year, including CrowdStrike recently, how are you guys approaching the buy versus build when it comes to a technology like AI that's developing pretty quickly?

George Kurtz
Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director

Well, when we look at the market, certainly, there's a lot of activity out there, and it probably isn't a week that goes by that we don't talk to some bankers that are talking about other companies. The great news is we've got a tremendous balance sheet. We're in a fantastic position to be able to build or buy or partner. And I think we've been very thoughtful about our acquisitions. And a big part of our strategy has been the integration.

When you look at Pangea, we're really starting to sell that in Q4 because we wanted to take the time and effort to integrate it. It's not just kind of stitch together. The single platform, which I talked about, is very important to our customers. So we're going to continue to be thoughtful. We're going to continue to buy what we perceive as best-of-breed in the market, not legacy technologies. We're going to integrate them, which is part of our customer brand promise. And we're going to continue to grow them within our sales motion and the channel that we built. So we'll be opportunistic, but we'll also be very strategic in what we buy.

Your last question will come from Adam Borg with Stifel.

Adam Borg
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Awesome. And Andy, congrats on the role. Maybe just on the identity business. It's great to hear the stronger quarter there qualitatively. I know we've talked in the past about PAM being almost like a 1.0 product. Love to hear more about how you're thinking about that product, in particular, and the maturity in coming quarters.

George Kurtz
Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director

Yes. So identity, as we mentioned, super important in an AI era, something that we got into many years ago, and we continue to evolve that. And we've seen some really nice wins specific to our PAM technology. We have to look at what customers are telling us and basically skate to the puck of where they're going, which is they're looking for more modern identity solutions. They're looking for solutions that can do just in time and some of the kind of legacy vaulting they'd like to move away from. So those are areas of focus for us.

We'll continue to build out our identity stack. It's been very successful for us. But certainly, there's more to do. There's more to build out and there's more opportunity in front of us. The good news is there's demand from customers, as you've seen lots of market movement. And as customers think about what they're going to do next, they want to make sure they set themselves up for really in the next era of agentic identity, and CrowdStrike will be there for them.
