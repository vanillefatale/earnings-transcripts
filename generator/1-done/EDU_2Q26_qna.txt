[Operator Instructions] [indiscernible] first question.

Felix Liu
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

First of all, congratulations on the very solid second quarter results as well as on the lift to your full year guidance. My question is on your guidance. Can management provide some breakdown on the segment growth as much as you can? I'm keen to understand the key drivers for the lift to your full year guidance?

Zhihui Yang
Executive President & CFO

Yes. Thank you, Felix. So let us start with this quarter's revenue growth analysis. We are very pleased to see the acceleration, what I mean is the growth of the K-12 business. As you know, I think this -- our strategy this year is to improve the product quality and service quality. And we have seen good results in Q2. We have seen the higher student retention rates and the better feedback from the customers. And -- so this is the K-12 business.

And so in Q3, I think the K-12 business will grow somewhere around 20% year-over-year or more. So let's say it's in 20% plus year-over-year growth. And overseas, yes, overseas related business, yes, we mean some of the revenue growth pressure. But I think we -- in the Q2, we still get the top line growth of the overseas test prep by 4% year-over-year growth. And we're quite resilient. And actually, I think we are taking the market share from the market. And so in the Q3, let's say, in the second half of the year, -- so I do believe the revenue growth will be flattish of the overseas-related business. It's still a drag, but I think we will do as good as we can.

College business, let's say, the 14%, 15% top line growth. And yes, this is a breakdown. And so in the second half of the year, I think we're quite positive about the revenue growth and the -- even the higher merger. Because -- since last year, March 2025, we started to the cost control. And I think we have done a great job. And going forward, we will do more on cost control. So it will improve the margin expansion going forward in the second half of the year and the year after.

Our next question comes from Alice Cai of Citibank.

Yijing Cai
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Congratulations on the strong results. We heard about the business integration between your test prep and consulting units, there I have 2 questions, quick questions. First, what is the expected margin expansion from this merger? And can it effectively offset the headwinds in the U.S. market? Second, regarding efficiency, how much reduction do you expect in the customer cost acquisition? And what is your target for the cross-selling rate?

Zhihui Yang
Executive President & CFO

Yes. Yes. I think, yes, I saw the news of the merging of the overseas test prep business and consulting business. And as you know, before the merging overseas test prep -- the unit and the consulting business provide the service to their clients, respectively. And each site has their own management teams, teachers, marketing staff, admin staff. And I think we -- now we put it together. We merged the overseas test prep and consulting business. And I think the merge -- so let's say, the restructuring aims to provide a customer with a one-stop service.

And I think the -- we will provide even better service to the customers, and also to be reduced absolutely some cost expenses because we put it together, and I think the -- one person can do more jobs even stronger than before. So let's wait till the next quarter's earnings call. I will share with you about how much cost we can save or even the -- how much can get more revenue or improve the top end growth and to save some cost to have the margin profile.

Our next question comes from Lucy Yu from Bank of America Securities.

Lucy Yu
BofA Securities, Research Division

Congratulations. So my question is on the margin expansion in the second quarter, which has been more than 1 percentage point. Could you please elaborate on the margin expansion? What is driving that? And how should we think about the margin expansion magnitude in the second half?

Zhihui Yang
Executive President & CFO

Yes. Okay. Yes. Lucy, I think your question is about margin. Yes, even, as I said, even though we made some margin drag from the overseas related business, but we still got the full margin expansion in Q2. The non-GAAP OP margin was increased by 470 basis points year-over-year. I think the margin expansion was mainly driven by the better utilization, the higher operating leverage and cost control and the -- and also the profit contribution from the East Buy.

I think we will continuously focus on operational efficiency and disciplined resource management, let's say, in cost control. We control the learning center expansion plan and we control the marketing expenses. You saw the numbers, the results -- and I think going forward, even the Q3 and the Q4 in the second half of the year, we will get the margin expansion. I don't want to give the detail guidance because typically, we don't give the margin guidance, but we are quite optimistic about the margin expansion in the second half of this year.

Next question will come from the line of Yikun Zheng from Citic.

Yikun Zheng
Citic Securities Co., Ltd., Research Division

Congrats on the strong results. So my question is about the overseas business. As you mentioned that the overseas business has like 4% of growth rate. Actually, the market condition is quite challenging. So just wondering the future trends and the main reason for the overseas that can get such good results?

Zhihui Yang
Executive President & CFO

Yes. I think yes. As I said, the overseas related business needs some impacts of the economy environment outside. But I think our team have done a great job. They have shown very resilient in the first half of the year. And we believe they will take the more market share from all the competitors. And also, I think the group gave the team more support than before because it needs some pressure. We should help them to do more jobs. And going forward, in the second half of the year, I think I just want to give the guidance, the flattish or little bit down a low single-digit growth because the outside environment has no change. But I believe our team will do the great job as they did in the first half of the year.

Our next question comes from D.S. Kim of JPMorgan.

D. S. Kim
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats on the great quarter. And I hope that -- this is first of many, many more quarters to come. Before I actually ask my question, can I double check on Lucy's earlier question on margin. Can we talk about how much of the margin expansion in 2Q, not the forward-looking, but 2Q came from core education versus East Buy to the extent that you can elaborate? And I have my question after this.

Sisi Zhao
Investor Relations Director

Yes. Actually, East Buy also reported their first year -- first half results, so you can roughly calculate. So if you take out East Buy all the rest together, margin expansion is roughly about 300 bps margin expansion year-over-year.

D. S. Kim
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And my actual question is for our new education business is great that we printed more than 20% growth. What do you think in your view is like sustainable growth rate for this segment from here, say, assuming stable 10% capacity expansion for -- like next 3 to 5 years, say, like 10% for the group capacity expansion, maybe that means K-9 capacity can grow maybe 15% per annum and then we can add on maybe 4%, 5% of ASP growth and a couple more points for efficiency gain or utilization gain, if you will. Does that mean that can we continue to expect say, 20% plus growth, I'm not talking about second half, but like next few years, based on this level of capacity expansion or the growth algorithm or formula can change versus what we had in the past?

Zhihui Yang
Executive President & CFO

Yes. I think it's a great question. We changed our strategy before the starting of this fiscal year. We slowed down the learning center expansion from 20%, 30% the year before to, let's say, 10%. So that means we put more focus on the quality -- and quality improvement. So I think all the business line, even the high school and the K-9 business the student retention rate is getting higher. I think it's even better than expected. And also, that means we got the better word of mouth. So we don't need to spend like crazy marketing expenses to acquire the new student enrollment. That means we get the new student enrollment by better word of mouth.

And so I think in the second half of the year, we guided the 20% plus the top line growth of the K-12 business, I believe we will keep the sustainable growth in the year after. Because the better quality and also the -- even the more -- the high -- the competitive edge of New Oriental, I think we deserve to get more -- new student enrollment even though we cut some marketing expenses.

And also, definitely, we will see more leverage because we just opened less than 10% new learning centers, but the revenue growth is something -- somewhere around 20%. So it will -- you will see the higher utilization rate and the higher margin of the K-12 business. Yes.

D. S. Kim
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I hope to see that coming through in many more years to come.

Zhihui Yang
Executive President & CFO

Yes. And also, I want to add one point to Sisi's comments. In the Q3, I do believe we got the margin improvement from both core business and East Buy.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Timothy Zhao of Goldman Sachs.

Timothy Zhao
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the solid results. So my question is that I recall in the last quarter results, you mentioned that I think about some of the new AI initiatives that you are launching. Just wondering if you can share any tangible results or any updates on the AI investments that you are making, for example, of a new course format that you launched probably late last year. Just wondering if there's any progress on that.

Zhihui Yang
Executive President & CFO

I think in the last 3 months, I think our team have done a lot on the new offerings of the new AI product. And I think we need maybe 1 quarter to testify the new offerings. And also -- and I believe it will contribute more revenue going forward. And one more point is -- I think the AI technology help us on the existing product.

You saw the higher student retention rate. Yes, we put more focus on the -- like the product quality and even the service quality, but I do believe the AI helps us to guide even higher student retention rate going forward. So -- and also the AI help us to get more operational efficiency to save some expenses and cost. So AI helps the whole group in 3 points, new offerings and the existing product improvement and cost savings. So I think we should spend a little bit more on AI technology, but it's not that much. And we will control the whole spending. But I think we will bear more fruit from the AI investments going forward.

Our next question comes from Elsie Sheng from CLSA.

Yiran Sheng
CLSA Limited, Research Division

Congratulations on the results. I have a follow-up question on the margin expansion because if we look into the details in the second quarter, the gross margin is going up and also the marketing expense ratio is also going down. And -- because I noticed that you earlier mentioned that you have initiated cross department customer service system to improve the service or efficiency and also reduce the customer acquisition cost. So I wonder if the decrease in the marketing expense ratio related to this initiative? And if it's so, how do we expect the impact of this going forward? Do you expect this trend of lower marketing expense ratio to continue in the next few quarters?

Zhihui Yang
Executive President & CFO

I think the situation will continue because -- yes, first of all, we put more focus on the product itself rather than spend more money on marketing, but growth is still very healthy. And also, as you said, we set up a new customer service department. And that means I think we will bring the information within New Oriental even the old departments, overseas, consulting, college, K-12 business, high school, K-9 and even other business and the tourism business at East Buy. So I think these new departments will bring us more traffic even within New Oriental customer resources. So this is -- I think, is a very good tool to save more marketing expenses.

And also, we just set up the 10% new learning centers this year. So we don't need to spend more money on marketing. And yes, even in the Q1, some -- I know some competitors did some summer promotion or even the reports in the summer. But we are happy to see more students from our competitors came back to New Oriental in autumn. So that means our core competitor were these product quality or quality turns to be better. And going forward, I think the selling and marketing expenses as the percentage of the revenue will go down going forward, even the second half of the year and year after.
