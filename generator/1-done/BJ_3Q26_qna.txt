Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Peter Benedict of Baird.

Peter Benedict
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I wanted to ask about some of the income demographics and the behavior. It sounded like it was relatively stable. And I think we're hearing a lot this week about kind of that lower and facing some struggles.

Can you remind us maybe your exposure to maybe the SNAP program, talk about the renewal rates you're seeing maybe across these income demographics, just anything further below the surface in terms of behavior across income demographics, both in the third quarter and then as you're kind of entering here into the holiday season?

Robert Eddy
President, CEO & Chairman

Pete, maybe I'll kick this one off, and Laura can add to it if she sees fit.

Our prepared remarks tried to tackle this question because we knew it would be out there. Certainly, everybody is concerned about the low-income consumer. The continued inflation provides clear pressure on that segment of all consumers and certainly that segment of our members.

With that said, removing the noise from the port strike and the hurricanes and stuff last year, we saw their performance in Q3 as being pretty resilient. The purchasing habits were very stable, and we're pleased to see that. There certainly was a lot of noise at the end of the quarter and the beginning of the fourth quarter around the SNAP program and the government shutdown.

I guess, I would say there was a slight disruption in the end of Q3, a more meaningful disruption in the opening days of Q4. But now that, that program is back on track, we're recovering. Those participants as they get access to their benefits are choosing to come to see us and -- as they have more opportunity to spend.

So we're encouraged by that showing from those members and from the members in the medium- and high-income cohorts that we saw during the quarter as well.

And maybe one final point. We're also encouraged, going forward, by the administration's help recently on the tariff front and reducing the cost of things that are not made or grown in the United States. And so that should be helpful to all consumers, but most pressingly, the low-end consumers that you referenced.

Laura Felice
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I think I'd just add on top of it from a membership perspective, we're really proud of our member -- our continued membership results throughout the year. We are acquiring members in our existing clubs, so comp clubs in our new markets and our new clubs that we've opened at the beginning of this year.

And there isn't anything, when we look at the details of membership to your question about kind of cohorts, that looks different. We're acquiring members across all the cohorts. And so we're really happy with our continued strength from a membership perspective.

Next question comes from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs.

Katharine McShane
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

We wanted to ask if you believe that the right long-term same-store sales growth for this business is in the 3% to 4% range. If so, why? And what do you think is holding you back from achieving this comp over the last several quarters?

Robert Eddy
President, CEO & Chairman

Kate, as you know, we've been transforming our business over the last several years with the idea of really four things: one, growing and maintaining a stickier membership; two, improving our merchandising; three, improving our convenience through digital; and then finally, increasing our footprint through real estate expansion. And as we talked about in the prepared remarks, all those things are heading in the right direction.

Certainly, the things that we're doing sometimes conflict with what happens in the outside world. We certainly have the luxury of competing against great competition, and it's certainly been a choppy economic backdrop out there. So we have tremendous confidence in our long-term ability to grow this business from a top line perspective. We're showing signs of that in all four of those pillars. And we'll continue to work on each of those to get to that point.

The thing that we try hardest to do, obviously, is put the right products on the shelf at the right value. And we made tremendous strides, I think, during Q3 to do that. Our merchandising team has put a lot of effort this year into that idea of greater products, greater values. And we made considerable investments in Q3 with that in mind.

We'll continue to do that because that's what we believe wins. Value and convenience are really what we're after for our members. And we'll keep plugging. We're very optimistic in our long-term aspirations.

Katharine McShane
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

And if I could just follow up with one question, you just mentioned the competitive environment. We were curious about what the competitive response has been when you open in some of these new markets, particularly Dallas, which has a really strong grocery offering and other club offering already. It sounds like things are going well there, but I wondered if you had any more details with the fifth store opening?

Robert Eddy
President, CEO & Chairman

Sure. The real estate growth story, and I'll let Bill talk about it since he is the architect of it, is a great one. It's certainly a continuing, sustained success and getting even faster with 14 clubs this year in lots of great markets. Those clubs are doing really well.

And so we're very enthusiastic about this ability to grow our company. And we've been received well in the markets that we've entered. So why don't I let Bill talk a little bit more about it?

William Werner
Executive Vice President of Strategy & Development

Kate, I think as Bob mentioned, we're really proud and excited about the success of the new clubs this year thus far and what's left to come for this year. And then as we look forward into Dallas next year, the prospect of going in and winning in that market is really important to the team.

We've talked about it a couple of times on these calls that the culture that we've built around new clubs is really important. And the team is actually at a high level. As we look back at this year so far, I think 2025 will go down as the best class of new clubs.

As far back as I can remember, with the success we've had with our 8 openings to date now and 6 more to go for the rest of the year, what we're seeing so far in those new clubs that haven't opened yet with preopening membership and the engagement of the community, we know that they're going to be outperformers as well.

And so as we take that momentum from this best class of openings into next year into Dallas, combined with the work that we've done in the market of raising awareness for our brand and engaging with the community, we have a ton of confidence that not only will we compete, but we'll be in a position to have great success there.

Operator

Our next question comes from Robby Ohmes from Bank of America.

Robert Ohmes
BofA Securities, Research Division

I wanted to follow up on the inventory positioning that Laura talked about. I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about that for the fourth quarter. Is it the positioning that sort of limits sales upside, but supports margins?

Just how -- what's the pluses and minuses of the tight inventory and semi-related Fresh 2.0 was like a great tailwind in comp driver, the benefit, the tailwind has slowed here. Is there anything that can reaccelerate? Is there a Fresh 3.0 or something like that, that's in the work here to kind of get that to reaccelerate?

Robert Eddy
President, CEO & Chairman

Robby, maybe I'll take a shot at starting off, and Laura can fill in.

I think what you're referencing is Laura's comments around proactively managing our general merchandise inventory. When we were in the beginning part of the year, I'm trying to understand where prices would go and costs would go as a result of tariffs, we made some proactive decisions to manage potential markdowns to allow us to fund greater investment in overall value for our members.

And I think that was the right decision. I think you want us to do that every day. That is really why we're here. We've taken those dollars and in fact, invested them across the rest of the business. In Q3, significantly reduced pricing on own brands water, on several other beverages, on some paper products across our produce assortment. So we are really trying to balance those two things.

And so we do have a more conservative inventory position from a general merchandise perspective, that was true in Q3. It remains true for the fourth quarter. And I do think it will limit the upside of the general merchandise business, but again, allow us to continue investing for the overall value for our members.

I think the other story within inventory is really an absolutely terrific performance in managing the overall inventory levels of the company. The team has done a really masterful job in the whole business to have our in-stock rates go up 90 basis points into inventories that are down.

We are doing a much better job allocating inventory throughout our chain, making sure that things are where they need to be, when they need to be there and to be in stock for our members every day. We need to keep turning that handle and get better and better every day, but I couldn't be more proud of the team to make a performance like that happen.

Anything else, Laura, on inventory? No?

Fresh 2.0, I think it was another terrific program, continues to yield benefits. You know that started out in our produce business. We had terrific produce results during the quarter again. And what you're seeing from the perishables business overall is some of the reduced benefits from egg inflation and things that are offsetting some of that great performance.

So with that said, we've talked about the next iteration of Fresh 2.0 and call it what you want, 2.1 or 3.0. We have made another set of considerable improvements in meat and seafood. And we're looking to doing the same in bakery and other categories as we go forward.

The mission there is the same, right? Our best members interact with us in these categories. If we can show them the greatest product, the freshest product at compelling value, is displayed in a way that is compelling, freeing our team members so that they are experts in all these disciplines; we can provide a better experience for our members, get more people into those categories and grow the overall traffic of the business.

That is certainly the result that we saw from Fresh 2.0 in the produce segment. The early returns on meat and seafood are good as well.

And so we're very optimistic about that program and its ability to drive sales within those categories, but also to get to that further bigger goal of driving traffic in the whole business, which obviously drives lifetime value. So some of these investments are expensive, but they're very much worth it in terms of driving the top line and the overall value of membership to BJ's.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Steven Zaccone from Citi.

Steven Zaccone
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I wanted to ask about the implied fourth quarter same-store sales because you referenced in the release that you've also seen some holiday momentum -- or excuse me, momentum to start the holiday season. Can you just talk through your category assumptions in the fourth quarter? And then, how you think about low end versus high end of the range?

Robert Eddy
President, CEO & Chairman

Sure. Again, maybe I'll start, and Laura can fill in, Steve.

We certainly, I think, had a good performance in the third quarter. I keep using that word resilient. But into the face of the port strike and the hurricane activity and all that stuff, our sales were a bit higher than we thought they might be in the range of outcomes.

And the team's preparation for the holiday season, I think, has been fantastic. We've been investing in value, we've got incremental promotions out there, we're continuing our really successful Free Turkey promotion, where if you spend $150 in 1 basket, you can get a free turkey for your family for Christmas. We're doing a lot of these things to really build on the momentum we saw in Q3 and get our members in our clubs and make them happy.

With that said, it's a choppy economic backdrop out there, right? We talked about the low-end consumer at this point. And we certainly have a little bit of a harder hill to climb from a comparative perspective, we had a good Q4 last year. But net-net, while it's a wide range of outcomes that can happen in any quarter, most notably the fourth quarter, we are cautiously optimistic about our ability to put up some good numbers in the fourth quarter.

Laura Felice
Executive VP & CFO

Steve, the only thing I might add to all the commentary Bob just said is I'd remind you about our inventory positioning that would be already talked about for general merchandise. So we've factored that into the range of outcomes.

That doesn't mean that we will be out of stock in general merchandise. It just means that we've tightened up the buys and we've picked the best of the best assortment. So we're ready for Thanksgiving, like Bob talked about. And we're ready for our members for holiday kind of as we roll into December.

Steven Zaccone
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. The follow-up I have then is on that general merchandise. So when we think about the inventory planning assumptions and maybe just talk about the buying environment, how does that look for the first half of next year, right? Because you made changes to the second half, presumably based on tariff uncertainty. But how does that apply to general merchandise plan as we kind of glance into 2026?

Robert Eddy
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Look, it's -- I don't want to get too far over skis and talk about next year. But obviously, the fourth quarter seasonal merchandise was bought in the spring when there was considerably more uncertainty around what the tariff exposures might be and what the consumer's response might be to any increase in prices. Every quarter we go through, we get more and more clarity and we get more information from our members as well. And so we obviously alter our buys accordingly.

I guess the other thing I would say is Q4 typically is a higher general merchandise penetration and obviously lower in the first quarter. And so this question becomes a little bit less important as we get into the beginning of the year.

Operator

Our next question comes from Mike Baker from D.A. Davidson.

Michael Baker
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

I hate to focus on the short term so myopically. But the guidance, your fourth quarter implied guidance, to me, I'm calculating around 2, 2.5 or something in that range. Correct me if I'm wrong on that, at least at the midpoint of the outlook. But if you are in that range, that's a pretty big pickup on a 2-year basis against the 4.6% last year.

So given all the caution you're talking about, can you square that? Or is it more reasonable to think about maybe the low end of the implied fourth quarter guidance, in other words, consistent on a 2-year basis?

Robert Eddy
President, CEO & Chairman

Mike. Look, let's just focus on the fact that we're cautiously optimistic, as I said earlier. We've done a lot of planning, a lot of action around providing our members the right products at the right value.

We talked about incremental promotion and building into that. We're certainly where we need to be from a digital perspective. People are loving interacting with our digital properties to get what they need from a convenience perspective. And we just -- we are trying to act within our purpose and take care of the families that depend on us.

And that is all those things, right, getting those -- getting the products on the shelf. We're doing a fantastic job doing that in an improved way, putting sharper prices on things, which we, again, had considerable improvements in during the quarter. And really trying to take care of all the different communities within our membership.

And we talked a little bit in our prepared remarks about our team members, maybe I'd take one minute to thank those team members out there every day, taking care of our members. They have the hardest job in our company. And guys, I'd really like to thank you for all your efforts. We initiated for the first time in our company's history, a 10% discount for our team members to really say thank you, to acknowledge that it's tough out there for everybody and to help our team members through their holiday season purchasing as well.

So I think we have a lot to be proud of. I think we have some momentum coming out of the quarter. The early days of Q4 have been reflective of that momentum. But we understand that there's a lot of road to go throughout the quarter. We're only a couple of weeks in. Next week -- this weekend and next week are huge for the quarter as are the remaining weeks in December.

So we feel like we're in a good spot, but it's very, very early. And so that thought process really is what drove us to have the guidance that we put out there.

Operator

Our next question comes from Ed Kelly from Wells Fargo.

John Park

This is John Park on for Ed. It sounds like the messaging is that you've been investing in price, but I guess merchant margins were flat. So I guess, what are some of the offsets in gross margin that helps you get there? And then anything on Q4 merch margins and how we should think about that?

Robert Eddy
President, CEO & Chairman

John, we certainly have invested -- we widened our price gaps in Q3 considerably with those investments versus competition. So I'd like to say thanks to our merchandising team for making those moves. It's important to our company, important to our members, for sure.

And we have many different levers to offset that throughout the business, not just within the margin construct. We will try and be as efficient as possible throughout the business to fund investments in member value.

Certainly, some of the offsets that you might think about within the merchandising world would be being more efficient in the distribution centers, trying to be more efficient from a trends perspective, growing our retail media program, which has been growing very, very nicely, the team is doing a great job there. There are many different things that we've tried to do so we can pass more value back to our members, and we'll continue to do that.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.

Pedro Gil

This is Pedro Gil on for Simeon. Nice job continuing to grow your digital business, really impressive. Could you comment on the work you're doing in retail media there? And also more broadly, we've heard some of your peers recently announcing partnerships in agentic commerce. Could you give us an update how you're thinking about the AI opportunity in e-commerce?

Robert Eddy
President, CEO & Chairman

Sure. As we've talked about, our digital business is an important part of our strategy. It has been growing by leaps and bounds for years now. So 30% during the quarter, over 60% on a 2-year stack. It is approaching 17% of our sales at this point. We are at a point that, frankly, a few of us didn't think we'd ever get to. And so we have a lot to be proud of there.

It all comes on the back of convenience. We have an incredibly talented digital team that builds these capabilities for our members to help them get access to tremendous value in a more convenient way than they otherwise might.

Most of our business, as you know, is in what we call BOPIC, Buy Online, Pickup In Club; as well as same-day delivery, as well as ExpressPay, where you check out in the club using your phone. Well over 90% of our total digital sales are fulfilled by our clubs. So we are efficiently building this business. It is certainly a moneymaking opportunity for us. We are really pleased with the way that it's growing.

Included in there is our retail media program that you referenced, and I talked a bit about it a few seconds ago. While still small, our team has been growing that quite nicely as well as we improve our website, as we improve the way that we partner out there with our advertisers, the way that we really coordinate between our different properties, whether it's our website or our app.

We are coming up with more ways to engage our members and allow our advertising partners to reach our members with compelling values that first and foremost, to help our members but also help us and our advertising partners. So we will continue to invest in that business in the future. Again, it's still small, but is growing quite nicely and allows us to make other investments in member value as we go forward.

Everyone talks about AI, we are no different. AI is a big part of our future. It is most notably used in our digital group at this point. And the use cases would not surprise you. They were on the vanguard of using it to make coding more efficient, making testing code more efficient. And they will continue to use AI in consumer-facing avenues as well.

And so I'll give you a couple of examples. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, we've got beta-launched AI shopping assistants and are using AI to do predictive shopping lists for folks.

Probably the thing that's most well along, however, is partnering AI with the robotics that we have in our stores. We have a robot that roams our stores named Tally. And initially, Tally was just helping us with inventory accuracy and price line accuracy. And now we have taken that much farther where Tally's imagery creates a digital twin of each of our buildings, something that we've never had before because our buildings don't have warehouse management systems.

And that has enabled really cool things from an operational perspective where not only are we getting better inventories and better pricing accuracy, but we are efficiently spotting problems for our team members to take care of, we are efficiently generating to-do list for our team members in the clubs find inventory and what needs more inventory, what should they be doing first within the building.

We are using it to make help us spot quality issues in our Fresh businesses as well, so we can make sure that our standards there are tiptop every day. We're finding new ways to use Tally and the data that provides every day.

I think the thing that's been most effective so far has been using those digital twins to predict the most efficient pick path for our team members to pick orders for BOPIC or curbside or same day, where they are about 40% more efficient today than they were before.

So we'll continue to build on the use of AI. We'll continue to focus on long-term investments that really will allow us to continue our mission, which is to offer our folks the best products at the best prices.

Probably the next thing up from a robotics and AI perspective will be our automated distribution center in Ohio that will go live next year. That will be when it gets going far more efficient than a traditional distribution center and will operate almost entirely in a robotic fashion.

So it will be fun to see that. I've been out there to see it recently, and I can't wait to see it with all the machinery going in there to see how it works. But it's all in the same spirit of providing even greater value for our members.

Laura Felice
Executive VP & CFO

Pedro, I'd just add all that commentary that Bob just said about Tally and the robotics we have in our club, there is a closed tie to that with the work that our planning and allocation teams are doing that we already spoke about in our prepared remarks. And that is producing our in-stock levels that have improved kind of year-over-year.

So there is a tie beyond some of the digital efforts into how we're putting product on our shelves and how our teams internally are using the data from Tally as well.

Pedro Gil

Awesome. Fantastic. And as a follow-up, if I could ask you, if you could comment on the competitive environment. You had a nice improvement in merch margin in the first half, a little more even this quarter.

To the extent that you can comment, and I totally get it, it's still early; how should we think about the level of investments next year? Are there any particular areas within grocery or gen merch that you're looking to prioritize?

Robert Eddy
President, CEO & Chairman

Look, I don't want to talk too much about next year, but I would just echo the comments that I've already made around the fact that our job is to provide our members great value every day. We've made considerable investments all year in doing so and have been pretty creative to find ways to fund it, having the merch margin results that we had in Q3, while making the investments that we made was a good result.

I would anticipate further investment going forward. As the competitive environment out there is, I think, consistent, but it's consistently competitive, and we need to continue to do our jobs to reward our members for their faith in us and the membership fees that they pay.

So we will continue to try and ride that balance between margin and value, but we will always err on the side of value to try and operate the business for the long term.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett.

Charles Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

On the margin front, just to move down the P&L a little bit, your SG&A per square foot levels have been really tight, which is good. But your peers are up a lot, suggesting maybe some investment in technology and other areas. So I guess my question is, how sustainable do you think maintaining that SG&A per square foot at that level over the next couple of years, particularly as you move into Texas?

Robert Eddy
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes, it's a good question, Chuck. Our teams have done a good job over time being very efficient with our buildings, making sure that, that they're in good shape. They're in far better shape today than they were 5 years ago.

With that said, we need to continue to do that and maybe even accelerate it. I think one of the things that we're seeing out there is our competitors getting sharper with their boxes.

And so we will have to continue to do that, not just because of the competitive environment, but we want to show our members the best box we can every day. And so I would imagine we'll spend some capital going forward, remodeling our boxes. We will obviously continue to spend into our new club pipeline as well. And we'll do that as efficiently as we can, but obviously, with an eye for the long term.

William Werner
Executive Vice President of Strategy & Development

Chuck, it's Bill. I'll just tack on to that as well. In addition to our existing clubs for the first time ever, we've really started to build a relocation program for some of our older clubs as well. So we had great success with our recent relocation in Mechanicsburg, PA. We announced this morning that we're going to relocate Rotterdam next year.

And so it's not just an eye to our existing clubs, but also to the long-term future of these strong markets where we may have buildings out a little bit on the older side. We're taking the opportunity to invest into the future there as well.

Charles Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Got you. Great. And then on general merchandise, right, like up 1.8% on the stacks much better than front half of the year, even with limiting inventory. You talked a little bit about the category improvement. I guess what do you think it's going to take to get home and seasonal to catch up to CE and apparel and other areas? And then I guess anything that you guys are excited about as we walk stores over the next couple of months into the holidays?

Robert Eddy
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes, sure. Maybe I'll start, and you guys can pick up.

Look, I think we've -- we've done some great things from a general merchandise perspective. As we talked about, we had a strong showing in Q3 from a consumer electronics perspective and from an apparel perspective. Consumer electronics has been a hallmark of GM for a while. It's always been a pretty good business for us, and it gets better. We have very talented merchants in that group.

Our apparel team has done a great job over the past few years really making sure that we simplify our assortment and bring in better brands, put great value out in front of our members every day. We need to continue to do those things, right? We might need to simplify our assortment a bit more. We need to continue to put great brands out there and put fantastic values on there as well.

We need to apply those same lessons to the rest of the business. And we are actively at work on those things. We've seen some green shoots in previous quarters, we've talked about those with you like toys and some of our gifting in previous quarters. I like our toy assortment this year as well. And I'm excited about the way our gifting looks in the front of our clubs as well.

But we need to have more sustained transformation in home and then seasonal going forward. These are probably the toughest categories, particularly the seasonal categories, maybe in the building. But certainly, among the GM categories, these are really tough categories. You need to be right on trend, you need to be right on style and color, on price point, all sorts of different things.

And while we've made strides, we're not done. We're not satisfied with where we are. We need to continue to turn the crank and get better going forward.

So we were under no illusions that renovating general merchandise would be easy or short in tenure. We've had nice success in the past, and we need to keep investing in that business because it is such an important part of the wholesale club model, where provides that treasure hunt, that emotional connection, those cool wow items that are so important to driving incremental trips.

And quite honestly, that question around membership renewal is not only tightly linked with the grocery business, but it's really tightly linked with our general merchandise business when you can have more opportunity to save your entire membership fee in one purchase rather than stacking up just good values on smaller ring items. You can save a couple of hundred bucks on a television or a mattress or a great seasonal item. That becomes a really important part of our overall long-term growth of our company.

So let me see if the guys want to file on, no? All right? So we're happy with our GM so far. We've got to get better and we'll continue to work at it.

Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer.

Rupesh Parikh
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Just going back to your commentary about 2025 clubs, the membership count is 25% ahead of plan. What do you think is contributing to that significant outperformance?

William Werner
Executive Vice President of Strategy & Development

Rupesh, it's Bill. I always come back to the success with the new club program comes back to the culture that the team has built. I think I've mentioned this a couple of times on previous calls that everyone that has evolved within new club program internally is fully engaged and fully bought in and want to see us be successful.

So we started this program way back in 2016 and the reps that we've built along the way. We talked about the goal of making the next opening, the best opening in the history of the company. Opening a new club where you have to build up, especially in the new market, membership base entirely from scratch is not easy to do, and it takes a lot of practice and a lot of learnings to do it right.

And we're executing at a higher level than we've ever executed. And as we think about going into the Dallas-Fort Worth market next year as well as all the other markets, a market like Foley, Alabama that we announced this morning is a really cool, unique market, and we're going to be really excited to be there. And we wouldn't be able to do that, we wouldn't have the confidence to do that without all the success that we've built up to this point.

So like I said, we're really pleased with what we've done here in 2025. It really has been probably the best class that we've ever opened in at least as far as I've been here. And it gives us a lot of confidence going forward. So more to come, but excited about what we've accomplished.
