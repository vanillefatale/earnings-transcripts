Question-and-Answer Session

Ana Soro

Thank you, Alex. We'll now turn to questions from our shareholders before opening up the call. We received a few questions asking what do you see as Palantir's unique differentiator that others may not understand?

Shyam Sankar
CTO & Executive VP

Well, Alex mentioned a bit of this here. It's become fashionable actually for lots of companies to start hiring FDEs. The Financial Times had an article about how it's the most popular new job title. But what you see is that they don't really understand it. It's just mimetic. And if you -- everything Alex, you said, like we build software that works, that not software that ought to work. We build software for the world as it exists, not a world that never was. And this ability to find what's true, that comes from the FDE. Our measure of success is not did we sell the software, it's did we solve the problem. And we have built an entire software stack over 2 decades, downstream of creating value for our customers. That led to the ontology a decade ago, more than a decade ago, which is a fundamental prerequisite to getting value out of LLMs in the enterprise. In this past year, it led to AI Hivemind and AI FDE.

Alexander Karp
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

The other thing, which like is implicit in that is the way we work puts us -- forces us to go up the chain of complexity every day. So we're taking on the most painful, most integral, most valuable parts of the stack in every enterprise. And it's precisely because like that's the way we actually lever our ability to deploy and orchestrate FDEs. That's the way we make our products stronger. And quite frankly, that's the way we produce these numbers because the closer you are to the front line of the very complex problem that a black box was not meant to solve, cannot solve. And at this point, everyone knows a joke to believe it could solve, that's where you -- and by the way, it's the safest position for us because this company, we will always believe that we are outsiders. We need to be in the place where the most valuable problem is being solved because that's the way we end up staying, solving the problem tomorrow and the way we get paid.

Ana Soro

Thank you both. Our next question is from Dan with Wedbush. [Operator Instructions].

Daniel Ives
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

Look, obviously, another monster quarter for you guys, congrats. So my question for you is for Alex and team. What -- can you just walk through just the accelerated sales cycles that you're seeing from so many companies that have gone to the boot camps? Like what surprised you from when they come to you at that first sort of contact to now actually launching deals. I mean, maybe you could talk about that just in terms of everything you're seeing anecdotally.

Ryan Taylor
Chief Revenue Officer & Chief Legal Officer

Thanks, Dan. So I think we look at U.S. commercial. We closed $1.3 billion in TCV at 6x on a dollar-weighted duration basis from what it was a year ago. And of those deals worth 83 were worth of $1 million or more 40 were $5 million or more, the 21 deals were $10 million or more. I've been involved in a lot of those directly. I'm feeling exactly what you're asking on the ground from customers.

And what's happening now is from the C-suite across the company, customers are coming to us looking to not just say, let's do a use case. The customers who are having the most impact are coming to us saying, how do we deploy this across our entire organization, how do we reorganize our entire organization around Palantir and AIP. And that's what's happening on the ground. And we're singularly focused on delivering the value to the customers, and that's our go-to-market. How do we get the product to them and deliver...

Alexander Karp
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Where Ryan is like really very much on the front line here is there's both how many customers approach you. I think where we're seeing the biggest shift is the customers who've approached us very quickly want to move to how would I change my enterprise to express it in a way that's most valuable according to my terms in your product? And then one -- and literally want a reorg, a short-hand version that we often use is you used to have to take a company private to change the unit economics of it.

Basically, just like we're providing venture results, high-end venture results to normal investors in the last couple of years, what we're doing actually in enterprise is, is providing a private equity like transformation in the public markets, in the public space under the current leadership. And that's essentially what our best -- and by the way, the other thing Ryan would tell you about is our newer clients have much higher expectations of us. Like they're like, essentially, I want to transform my business. I want to do it in months. I want to do it in the public eye, while being in the public market, mostly not exclusively.

And I want you to not only do the product side but also tell us how would you actually implement AI, foundry, ontology, FDE model and our tribal knowledge to do that. And it's a completely different game. We used to have to beg and plead to be like -- when we first started talking, we were begging and pleading to be at the margin of a problem that could affect a subset of the business. By the way, Shyam, it's like, unfortunately, can only tell you 1% what he's involved in. But this is like exactly the same in the U.S. government around the world. It's like the things that we're sitting on and working on are like crazy, crazy and important and are not downstream of the problem. They are the problem, and we're reshaping them.

Ana Soro

Thank you both. Our next question from Mariana with Bank of America.

Mariana Perez Mora
BofA Securities, Research Division

I'm going to do, as usual, a couple of questions, one on commercial, one on defense or government. On commercial, I'd like to follow up to Dan's question. And let's see if you can discuss what changed from a behavioral perspective, from a customer perspective to see this accelerated appetite to incorporate Palantir to not only accelerating how many customers you have, but also the existing customers go to -- go up the value chain. And what changed internally as well? We recently saw in a visit the like AI agents or AI FDE is, like how are you incorporating tech internally to be able to accelerate and catch up with that demand? And on the government side, U.S. government up 50% plus is really impressive. And how do you think about opportunities like Golden Dome going forward adding up to this?

Alexander Karp
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Well, you guys want to answer these questions? I think that there's an external one, which is like what does it feel like? That's clearly you. The internal one is a really subtle question. And I don't know anyone should jump in there? And then obviously, you should have Shyam opine on.

Shyam Sankar
CTO & Executive VP

Yes. Well, do you want to start with commercial or...

Ryan Taylor
Chief Revenue Officer & Chief Legal Officer

Sure. Yes. I think on the external, I think it's like going deeper and deeper and more and more like tangible results with customers where they're -- there's a network effect in coming, like customer sharing impact that we're having and direct impact we're having with customers. Customers are seeing as we -- it's a continuation of what we've been doing, but going deeper and deeper with the customers on that impact. And I think that what we're seeing is more and more are now coming to us saying -- and the ones that are most impactful are coming to us saying, let's do more.

Alexander Karp
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Ryan is our best at being a wonderful -- I'll just give a vulgar version here. Our clients realize the choice is suck basically. And they've tried a lot of stuff. It hasn't worked. And then we're in so many verticals. We're -- let's just say, we're in vertical 252 and we dominate for one customer. People see that. And then they're like, "Oh, well, I'll try this with some, I don't know, knock off half fake thing. It's just like -- and then a lot of people really still don't understand that are still trying to do this long migration where LLMs are going to perform as if they're LLMs and ontology. And as if they are LLMs were not a commodity. And then -- but then in the marketplace, they see the final result of someone else using ontology, foundry, FDE.

And now it's like, wait a minute, I'm paying hundreds of millions of dollars in getting nothing. And the person down the road, I kind of looked down on is way ahead of me and their unit economics are transforming overnight. And that just shifts the whole conversation because then we're like, okay, well, if you want it to work, you can have to do these 5 things. And these things are like you're going to have to talk to Ryan and they're going to have to -- I don't know, occasionally meet with me, and you're going to have to actually allow us to come in with engineers. And you're going to -- we're going to have to actually work on the problems that are valuable for your business and also look at the costs that are dragging you down.

By the way, the cost for most businesses is not just the actual money they're wasting. That wasted money creates an ecosystem of waste. They're talking to all these vendors all the time about all these things will never work instead of solving the problem. And so like -- and so getting the pathogens out of their business is a real issue, and now they're really, really interested in this. And so -- and then on the internal front, I would say it's just we have to double down.

The most important thing for us internally is with all this success, we do not want to give up the unique attributes of Palantir and somehow purchase fake ways for us that are artificial for us. And so making sure we are very, very close to the problem and making sure everyone here, like if you heard our internal dialogue, it's much more like who's on the factory floor here. What are we doing internally? How do we make sure our products are better and better? How do we make sure, say, Shyam is a savant at going around and figuring out what the underlying tech issue is, how are we making sure we have the best product team and the very, very exact right fit for every single deployment across our deployments that we care about, especially mission deployments, which we highly, highly overvalue in terms of our time and energy.

And like how do you make sure Palantir stays as tribal and cultus and unique as it was 20 years ago? How do we double and triple down on that? And how do we recruit the right people. And then internally, we have, look, we power ICE, we power efforts to defend America and Ukraine and with allies. We're on the front line of all adversaries, including vis-a-vis China. And we support -- we're at ICE and we're -- we've supported Israel.

Okay. These are very controversies. I don't know why this is all controversial, but many people find that controversial. Okay? So how do you align people to focus on these things in a way that is actually beneficial for us and our clients. These are really hard and tricky issues that we spend a lot of time. I would say, as an overarching thing, because what we found is the more we focus on our internal dynamics, the better our numbers are. That's why we have less salespeople, and we have 77% growth in 75% of our market, 121% growth in U.S. comp. Please tell that to some of your friends. I don't even understand how they can look at these numbers and not drop the key out of their [ Immortal Six ] and just like say, I mean, they're like they're fantastic numbers but it's like internal focus.

Shyam Sankar
CTO & Executive VP

I'll make the mistake of trying to follow Alex there and just say on the internal side with AIFDE, that's why we actually originally built it. Our headcount has grown roughly 10%, but revenue grew 63%. How are we doing that? We've made our FDEs wildly more productive. And I mean, so much so that we decided to give it to our customers. And we've started to make our customers more productive. When you have a note like the Army Vantage note, where the Army is consolidating into the Army data platform, you now have an army, literal army of green suiters who need to become proficient developers in the software.

And you have a generation of green suiters whose first interaction with the software is going to be with AI FDE. They're going to be super heroes on day 1. I think that it's accelerating adoption. It's accelerating understanding like the depth of adoption, not just are you using it, but how much of it are you really using? How much of it can you understand?

And then quickly on your comment on the U.S. government business, like, yes, the number of opportunities out there are great. I can't comment on all the opportunities you mentioned there, but whether it's NGC2, the continued growth of, Maven, I mean we have, of course, America is involved with 3 conflicts right now in the world from Europe, the Middle East and in our own hemisphere right now. And things are getting a little spicy. By the way, let me say something slightly political, and I'm not saying other people agree with this. But when people are attacking our soldiers for stopping fentanyl from coming to this country, I want people to remember, if fentanyl was killing 60,000 Yale grads instead of 60,000 working class people, we'd be dropping a nuclear bomb on whoever was sending it for South America.

So it's slightly -- like we -- in this -- at Palantir, we are on the side of the American -- average American who sometimes gets screwed because all the empathy goes to elite people and none of it goes to the people who are actually dying on our streets. And that's why it's like when you have an open border, it means that the average poor American earns less. I know my fellow progressives believe having an open border is going to make things, but that's because they're actually repping elite people instead of the working class.

And the same thing in South America, is like to believe our constitution does not give us the right to stop 60,000 deaths a year of working class men and women is insane. And this company -- this country is right to stop that. And I am very proud. I don't know all the efforts we're involved in, but to the extent we're involved in these efforts, I and most Palantirians are very proud of this.

Ana Soro

Thank you. Alex, as always, we have a lot of individual investors on the line. Is there anything you'd like to say before we end the call?

Alexander Karp
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

We're rocking along. Please turn on the conventional television and see how unhappy those that didn't invest in us are, enjoy get some popcorn, they're crying. We are every day making this company better, and we're doing it for this nation, for allied countries and also for -- and I never really like the term retail investors. How about same people who put up their own money and fight for us -- and by the way, you are fighting for the right side of what should work in this country, meritocracy, lethal technology vis-a-vis adversaries, products that spread GDP to working-class women, men and women by making their value creation higher and by the way, your bank account. And thank you for that.

Ana Soro

Thank you. That concludes Q&A for today's call.
