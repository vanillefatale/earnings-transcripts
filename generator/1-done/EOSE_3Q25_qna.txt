Question-and-Answer Session

Elizabeth Higley
Director of Investor Relations

Thanks, Joe. So, moving to a few of the questions we've received online with the first question being, can you provide an update on the time line around Factory 2 outside TA? And if Project AMAZE will need to be completed before Factory 2 lines go live?

John Mahaz
Chief Operating Officer

Thanks for the question. As we discussed earlier in my opening remarks, we now have building partners and automation partners that can deliver a line every 90 days. This work can all be done simultaneously going forward.

Elizabeth Higley
Director of Investor Relations

Thanks, John. Next question. As the company navigates a capital-intensive scale-up phase, how are you balancing the need for fresh funding with imperative to avoid excessive shareholder dilution? And what milestones might unlock access to lower cost capital?

Nathan Kroeker
Interim CFO & Chief Commercial Officer

Thanks, Liz. As you just heard John say, we're positioned to add manufacturing capacity to meet this growing demand. We're in an energy super cycle and it's my job to deliver the orders and the capital to support this growth. And I'm committed to doing this in the most cost-effective way possible for the company. All right.

Elizabeth Higley
Director of Investor Relations

Thanks, Nathan. I think the next one here is for Joe. What is the long-term vision? And how do you plan to surpass or match the competition?

Joseph Mastrangelo
CEO & Director

Thanks, Liz. So, look, I mean, you heard John talk about positioning us to be able to add capacity in a 90-day rhythm. That's great when you talk about being an energy super cycle. Nathan is out there with his 2 hats, winning the orders to fill the factory and securing the capital to drive growth. I'm just excited about the product that the team has delivered. I mean, we've got some things that we're working on that we're really excited about that will position us to be the energy storage product to help meet the needs of this energy super cycle.

We've got some work to do to continue to close the gap on profitability, and I feel really good about the playbook the team has to be able to do that. But at the same time, we've got to make this the easiest technology to work with out in the field, and that's why we're investing in a software hub here in Pittsburgh. And I think when you think about what we want to do is take a great technology, build it quickly and operate it easily out in the field. That's the simple strategy of this company and what everybody is executing on.

With that, we'll turn it back over to the operator and see if there's any questions from our sell-side analysts. Thanks.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Maybe just to kick things off here. I know you tweaked the '25 guide here. But if you think about like the quarter-over-quarter run rate and trajectory, I know you articulated this more in operational terms in your prepared remarks. But how would you think about as you exit '25 with that 4Q that's implied with your full year '25 guide, how do you think about that ramping into '26 here and what that trajectory suggests? If you just look at the 2Q, 3Q, 4Q trajectory on top line, I'm just really curious how you think about that revenue trajectory going into '26, and the ability for your commercial -- yes, go forward.

Joseph Mastrangelo
CEO & Director

No, thanks for the question. So, in my prepared remarks, I talked about -- so Q3, we were at 15% capacity utilization. If we look at going forward, we'll exit Q4 running our complete asset base 24/7. So, you're looking at going from a 15% capacity utilization to 90-plus from a capacity utilization standpoint. So, a lot of work was done in Q3, installing capacity, training our workforce, training the additional shifts and all the costs associated with it. So, as you fast forward, all the ramping will be done. So, as we enter Q1 at the very start, we'll be at OEs higher than 90% and we'll be fully realizing and utilizing the capacity.

John Mahaz
Chief Operating Officer

And then Julien, on the revenue side, and I'll let Nathan kind of add some comments there because that kind of falls into his 2 hats.

Nathan Kroeker
Interim CFO & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. No, I mean, John did a good job of laying out what we're doing this year. I think as we look forward into 2026, we're seeing a tremendous amount of activity in our pipeline, right? Pipeline is up 21%. 22% of that now is data center activity. We talked about kind of the sales cycle and how these things mature over a period of months, even quarters. And we continue to see very strong activity in the pipeline as we move forward.

Good news is John's capacity expansion now can be moved in 3-month increments as the orders come in. And I think we're going to see new orders come in. We're going to add capacity to line up with those orders and I see consistent revenue growth over time. Yes.

John Mahaz
Chief Operating Officer

And Julien, the only the thing I would add on the pipeline and order side, we've always been very conservative about what we do with our backlog and our orders pipeline. Nathan's got some things going on that are MOUs that we haven't been able to announce names yet, and he continues to work with Justin and the entire team to get some of these hyperscalers to go from an MOU to firm projects. And we really only want to talk about them when we close them and there's project names that we can talk about, like we do with Frontier.

And I'll make one more point. So, you think about the -- all the assets that we're installing, so we're learning as we go, right? So first bipolar line comes in, took us several weeks to get it up and running. 6 and 7 that we just got up, now we're talking days. The same thing will fast forward to when we launch line 2 in the spring. All those learnings, so we're able to shrink the ramp, shrink the time to get up to full capacity. So, everything we're doing now we're learning because it's -- so with the data, we're going to be able to aggressively move forward much quicker than we are right now.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Awesome. And guys, if I can take sort of the natural extension of that last question, how are you thinking about the ramp here, right? I mean it's pretty phenomenal what you've just achieved in the last 6 months here, as you just described. How do you think about the cadence of ramping further lines? And then also, related to that, how do you think about the financing side of that, right? So you've got the $43 million from Cerberus, you have the $24 million award.

You've got unrestricted balance of $60 million. You've got an ability to tap DOE. How do you think about financing that against potentially what seems like an accelerated ramp on CapEx? I don't want to put words in your mouth when I say accelerated, but I'm curious on how you think about just teeing this all up and setting expectations.

Joseph Mastrangelo
CEO & Director

I think, Julien, I -- let's kind of put the puzzle together there that you're laying out. We have a loan from the LPO from the Department of Energy that finances 4 lines, right? And we're going to line 2. What John is trying to do is like what we -- and what we have to do is reduce the cycle between starting and getting a line up and running so we start producing revenue off of that so that the capital requirements in effect, become operational versus financial. That being said, we're in a moment of time here where the industry and the world needs our product and we've got to be able to ramp into that as quickly as possible.

I've said many times, like we don't want underutilized capacity sitting around. But we're looking at all this. And what John has put together from the different automation suppliers that he now has and breaking this up into pieces and getting everybody focused on delivering to that goal, we'll be able to get that capacity online in 90 days, which is well within the cycle time of how Nathan is selling the product. So, part of it will be what we already have in place. Other things will be -- come from operations and deposits from customers as we close orders. And then we'll look to be opportunistic if need be for growth capital if we have to.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Awesome. Excellent. One last tweak here. You talked a lot about operational metrics improving, but it seems like the latest quarter ASPs went up materially. Again, you tell me if we're reading that right. And you also flagged, I think, in the Q here, a concentration with like 80-plus percent tied to a single customer. This is not the same customer as you guys have been concentrated to in the past, I presume. Can you talk to that just a little bit about the ASP dynamics and the customer maybe of late?

Nathan Kroeker
Interim CFO & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. We talked about this a @little bit last quarter as well. So Q2, I think, was the anomaly because we had one strategic customer that was a drag on revenue in Q2. What we're seeing in Q3 was revenue rates reverting back to what we view as a more normal run rate. And then deliveries in the quarter, I mean, it was 5 individual customers. They're not all equally weighted. But I would say the customer base that we delivered to in Q3 was representative of what customer base would look like going forward.

Joseph Mastrangelo
CEO & Director

And Julien, I just want to add 2 points on top of what Nathan just said. ASP, like you could -- like I try not to pick individual contracts. We're managing a portfolio. Like any portfolio, highs, lows, but you got to get your average where it makes sense, and the average of the portfolio is up and it's up because people are seeing the value of the technology.

Now, on this strategic customer that we talked about last quarter, look, we're getting data from that system out in the field and it's on that page that we talked about and the data is phenomenal. So I look at that as kind of an investment in our future where we needed to get Z3 out in the field at scale and see it operate, and it's delivering on those results. So, it's a mix of all things. But the overall portfolio of the order book, ASP is higher than what it was.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Yes, absolutely. I'm very curious to see some of these strategic partners in their Analyst Days in coming weeks.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Please.

Stephen Gengaro
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

So I think two things for me. One is just a follow up on the last question. I'm not sure how much you want to say, but you talked about sort of the average selling price kind of across the portfolio. Is that -- how does that look in the backlog and the recent awards that you're booking relative to kind of what you're realizing now?

Nathan Kroeker
Interim CFO & Chief Commercial Officer

Look, I mean, you can do the math on the backlog page, right? I mean we -- you can see total dollars and total gigawatt hours and how that's trended over time. And it stayed pretty consistent over time. I mean, we're not seeing long term -- long term, I think, the revenue rates that we've realized and expect to realize going forward are going to be pretty consistent.

When you get larger orders, we're working with customers and say, okay, what is our cost curve doing, what can we do from a large volume buy perspective. You saw the chart we showed on Page 8, I think it was, where you see margins improving over time. You see net margins improving over time as we continue to scale the business. But we think we're going to turn the corner here and get to positive contribution margin into this quarter, positive gross margin exiting Q1 on a path to profitable positive EBITDA after that.

Joseph Mastrangelo
CEO & Director

And Steve, what I would add on top of that, look, part of my job is handing out the targets to people and the orders that were recently closed are well within the ASP portfolio target that Nathan has as CCO.

Stephen Gengaro
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

That's helpful, because I couldn't do the math on the post-quarter announcement, but that's fine.

John Mahaz
Chief Operating Officer

And remember, -- we're talking about, Stephen, that's post quarter close that happened after the quarter, after 3Q. So that will be out in 4Q.

Stephen Gengaro
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. The other one I had is -- it's around the margins, but it's around the cost side. When we think about the progression of margin and some of your bigger costs that go into making the product. How should we -- like what are the necessary levers that get you to gross margin positive? Is it the supply chain improving? Is it the COGS coming down per unit? Is it just scale? Like are there -- is there color you can give us around how to think about the cost structure? That's the biggest -- as you've been successful with the ramp and the backlog growth, that's the biggest question we get from investors pretty consistently is, what does this look like at scale from a profitability perspective? So, I'm curious if you could give some incremental color.

John Mahaz
Chief Operating Officer

So, from a cost perspective, I already talked about the asset utilization. The same thing is true here is with our suppliers. So, they've had to put a lot of assets in place to be able to support this ramp. So, as we ramp, they're ramping. So, they're seeing cost optimization, they're seeing cost absorption, which will translate in cost reduction from a parts situation.

Then you kind of look at labor costs. So, a lot of what we're focused on right now is taking cost out and making things more efficient. So, I'll give you one example. We were focused on our gate and with that, we were looking at travel time, material, the way they're presented. Basically, all aspects of that operation came in on 1 weekend, completely changed the way we were doing that operation. And the 5 days prior to what we did versus the 5 days ahead, we doubled the output. So, the work we're doing is not having incremental gains, it's having step function gains. So, we talked about labor, you talked about utilization. Again, we'll be at 100% utilization coming out of Q4. So you're going to get match the asset. Then it's about taking cycle times out.

So, if I can -- we've got a heavy automated process. So, if I can take 10 seconds down to 9.8 seconds, down to 9.6 seconds, and that work is absolutely doable. Again, you keep moving it forward. The one thing I like about being here is where I came from, I had thousands of different products. So, the focus would shift every day. Now -- come in every day and focus on the one product. So, this journey never ends. There -- we will continue to look at all of our cost buckets and continue to put projects together that will close those out.

We, right now, just in taking material cost out, forget cost savings and what we're asking from the vendor, we've got 61 different projects that we're doing right now to take the amount of parts that we have out, to take the cost out, 61 projects, and all of those projects will be closed before we exit Q2. So that's the way I kind of think about it.

Operator

And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Joe Mastrangelo, CEO, for closing remarks.

Joseph Mastrangelo
CEO & Director

Thank you. Thanks, everyone, for listening. Look, one thing I want to talk about here in the closing is like the project that Nathan and Justin closed with Frontier Power, because this kind of lays out another strategic puzzle piece for us as we grow the company.

Look, we met Frontier back in January. Nathan and Justin met them at a trade show in the U.K. We developed a relationship, signed an MOU, got a project pipeline. And every week, we meet with Cerberus, and we go through where we are in cash, where we are financially, how are we doing in performance. And we look at Frontier not as a transaction, but as a platform. Cerberus financed Frontier because we view this as experienced operational leadership in the industry that can help us build a platform to expand out in Europe. We're excited about how that's going to look as we move forward and really look forward to partnering with the team at Frontier.

At the same time, we're looking at what John is doing operationally, and you heard a really -- it's fun working with him. It's great having him on the team and seeing what he's been able to deliver and the whole team underneath him. We just have to keep growing, keep focused and knowing that the industry needs our product. We got to continue executing and we got to keep making this simpler and easier to do business with. We look forward to keeping everyone updated on the progress. I want to thank everyone for listening today. Thanks a lot. Talk to you soon.

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.
