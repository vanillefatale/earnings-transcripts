[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Asad Haider with Goldman Sachs.

Asad Haider
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Maybe for Rob on BD. I was reassured to hear in the prepared remarks that you are assessing potential targets with urgency. And certainly, your Verona deal seems well received, and it seems that the market wants to see more of those types of transactions from you. So I guess any updated framing on what you're looking for would be helpful. And then related, there's also been an ongoing pickup in discussions about the potential reemergence of potentially transformative larger transactions in the industry, just given the external environment. So curious if you could share your updated views there.

Robert Davis
Chairman, President & CEO

Great. Asad, thanks for the question. As it relates to business development, as you point out, we were very excited about getting the closure of the deal with Verona. And as you know, we continue to see OHTUVAYRE as a multibillion-dollar opportunity. So excited about that. But as we've also said, we're not done, we do need to do more.

We continue to look across all therapeutic areas. I would say, obviously, the areas of focus for us continue to be aligned with what is our key therapeutic areas from the business perspective. Oncology continues to see a lot of opportunities, immunology, cardiometabolic and the like are where we're continuing to focus. As is always the case, science will drive us. And when we see a scientific opportunity where there's an unmet need that we think strategically aligns with our approach, if we see value, we'll move. So no change in our approach.

And as you think about deal size, we continue to be focused in that $1 billion to $15 billion range as the primary area. But as we've been clear to say in the past, we are willing to go larger than that, but always with the focus on science and always understanding that if we look and see an opportunity, we're going to do it based on that unmet need.

As you think forward to your broader question on the reemergence of potential larger scale deals, our view of that has not changed. We do not think that a transformative acquisition, a synergy-driven deal is something that we need to do nor aligns with our future because as you know, we have one of the most robust pipelines we've ever had, and we see large synergy-driven deals as disruptive to that activity. And so our focus will be on bringing in pipeline assets not on those types of deals. But as you think about that, as we've said in the past, we're open to Phase I all the way through Phase III, and where we can find it, commercial opportunities. So we look across the full spectrum.

Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Citibank.

Geoffrey Meacham
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I had a pipeline one for Dean. So on the expanding development of your TLL1 (sic) [ TL1A ] immunology, I'm assuming that a broad development program was already in place surrounding the Prometheus deal. But maybe talk about the selection of the indications that you just announced from a mechanism perspective and maybe what additional development opportunities do you like across the I&I space.

Dean Li
Executive VP & President of Merck Research Laboratories

Yes. Thank you very much for the question. I mean the focus initially was in the GI space, and we're -- our ambition is to be the first and best-in-class TL1A. We've always talked about that expansion. We've always thought about that expansion, and that expansion has been recently sort of outlined with recent Phase IIb studies in rheumatology and dermatology.

The question is, could we see more? I will always leave that open. I do think that the Phase III for ulcerative colitis and especially for Crohn's disease is very important to me, not just because it's in GI, but in Crohn's, there's an element of fibrosis. And the other one is the Phase II in SSc-ILD. I will need to see that because if I see that in Crohn's disease, then you all of a sudden start talking about not just similar to other anti-cytokines, dampening down inflammation, you then have a leverage in terms of fibrosis. And that would steer us in relationship to what we would do next.

Our next question comes from Akash Tewari with Jefferies.

Akash Tewari
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

So your team has talked about a 1.0 and 2.0 solid tumor strategy, with 1.0 being sac-TM3 -- sorry, sac-TMT and then 2.0 is combining the ADCs with the PD-1 VEGF. At ESMO, it looked like your TROP2 is showing a 6- to 12-month benefit on overall survival, at least it's trending that way in second line. And that's triple what we're seeing with the PD-1 VEGF. So what gets you more excited? The signal you're seeing with your TROP2 or the PD-1 VEGF class? And how does that impact your appetite to potentially run another round of Phase III combo trials with the LaNova asset?

Dean Li
Executive VP & President of Merck Research Laboratories

Yes. So I should probably reset. I don't believe that we've said anything in relationship to how you've talked about it in terms of the different phases. We are extremely excited about the TROP2, the sac-TMT, and we've had a productive relationship with Kelun.

One of the things I would just emphasize is it's very easy to sit there and say, "Oh, this is a TROP2 ADC, and we throw all the TROP2 ADCs in a bucket as if they're not different." I think the recent data suggests that there may be differences, and we're really interested as we move 15 Phase III studies, but 10 of them are actually in places where the other TROP2s haven't gone. So we're very interested in pushing the sac-TMT with and in the appropriate place with IO or with other precision targeted.

In relationship to the PD-1 VEGF, we're also interested in advancing that and seeing that data just evolve not just with us, but from the outside world. And that will define to us where we would put the PD-1 VEGF in relationship to PD-1. But I just want to just make sure that we're very excited about the sac-TMT. We've shown data, Kelun has shown data. You've highlighted how it's different. We believe that we're eager to see the trials that can drive that in -- not just in the Chinese patient populations, but in the U.S. and globally.

Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.

Evan Seigerman
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

I wanted to just touch on the ENFLONSIA launch in the United States. Heading into RSV season, can you just talk about the initial feedback, say, versus the competition and kind of what you're seeing in terms of potential uptake as we head into RSV season.

Robert Davis
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Maybe I'll start, and then if Caroline wants to jump in, she can as well. Overall, we feel good about where we are with ENFLONSIA. If you look at how that launch has progressed, I would point out that while we did receive, obviously, all the full approvals we were a couple of weeks later than initially expected. So that did play into this because it put us a little bit later into the season. We did highlight, as Caroline pointed out in the prepared remarks, there was $75 million -- or $79 million of initial stocking, and that really was the seeding order from the VFC as well as other wholesaler distributor stocking.

So as we sit here right now looking at the season and into next year, we really continue to see an opportunity. I would point out, if you think about the benefits ENFLONSIA brings, there's no weight-based dosing, our ability to look at our total contracted portfolio of vaccines. All of the things we've talked about continue to make us believe this will be a very important vaccine. And as we look forward into '26 and beyond, we continue to see that. We'll see where the rest of '25 plays out, but it's -- all in all, given the timing of when we started, we feel good.

Caroline Litchfield
Executive VP & CFO

And just to add to Rob's comments, we had the seeding order in the third quarter. We expect that to be utilized during the fourth quarter. Feedback from customers has been very good, and we look forward to having an impact this season and much more of an impact as we go into 2026.

Our next question comes from Daina Graybosch with Leerink Partners.

Daina Graybosch
Leerink Partners LLC, Research Division

I wonder if you could give us an update on KEYTRUDA and the proportion of the sales that you have from early-stage settings and a breakdown of which of those tumor types of the 10 approved is driving that revenue?

Robert Davis
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I'll start, Daina, and then Caroline can jump in as well. So if you recall, if you look at where we are in the earlier-stage setting, we have currently 10 approved indications, now 5 with overall survival, which is important. And if you look at where we are going forward, the drivers of that in that cervical continues to be important, RCC, we continue to see TNBC and non-small cell lung cancer, all are important drivers. We're obviously excited. We don't have approval yet, but you heard that we have yet another potential OS benefit coming, 905, I believe it is, that Dean spoke about earlier. So yet more coming, and that's in muscle invasive bladder cancer.

So a lot out there, we're excited about where it goes. It's driving over half of our growth. Right now, it's coming from earlier-stage indications. And we achieved -- if you look back to -- we indicated we would be at 25% in 2024, and '25, we're now -- we're exceeding 25%. We have not given specific targets, but we see it growing as a percent overall of total sales, and it's over half of our growth. So it is an important driver, especially as we think about the QLEX launch that is just starting to get underway.

Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.

Christopher Schott
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just Rob, a question on MFN. I appreciate the color in the prepared remarks. But just following some of the recent deals with the administration, both with Pfizer and Astra, should we be thinking about this type of structure as a reasonable framework for the industry? And just any updates in terms of where Merck is in terms of its discussion with the administration on MFN.

Robert Davis
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. As I said in the prepared remarks, overall, we're aligned with what the administration is trying to achieve, which is to lower the out-of-pocket cost for patients at the pharmacy counter and at the same time, to get foreign prices up to ensure that foreign governments are paying their fair share. So those broad-based principles, we're aligned with. We are in continuing discussions with the administration. I'm not going to give any specific updates other than to say, I am very optimistic that we're going to have a constructive outcome to those discussions. And the framework, we'll wait until we actually have something to talk about there to be more specific to how we see ours coming out.

Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Cantor.

Carter Gould
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

You had a pair of good WELIREG data recently. So Dean, I wanted to ask you around your confidence in ultimately hitting on OS in the 022 study and the importance of that in moving the needle on adoption in that setting.

Dean Li
Executive VP & President of Merck Research Laboratories

Yes. So we are equally excited about the WELIREG. It's a first-in-class treatment. We've announced the top line Phase III for the second line as well as the adjuvant. And I also think it's important that in one of the trials, the ability of a HIF-2 alpha to do something on top of the VEGF blocking agent is important.

In relationship to OS, I think OS is always really important. It's important for the FDA, but most importantly, it's important for patients. So we are really eagerly awaiting to see if and when we cross that boundary. And so yes, we are excited, and we have a broad portfolio program in WELIREG. And so we'll be anxious to share those results when we get them.

Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.

Terence Flynn
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Caroline, I know you commented somewhat on expenses for 2026. I was just wondering if you can give us any comments on the top line in terms of some of the pushes and pulls as we think about that, recognizing you probably don't want to give guidance yet at this point, but just maybe help us think through some of the levers there.

Caroline Litchfield
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Of course, Terence. So as we go into 2026, we are expecting solid top line growth for our company, and that growth will increasingly be fueled by the number of new launches that we have. So we're expecting continued patient impact and revenue growth from WINREVAIR. OHTUVAYRE now is also part of the Merck portfolio. We have CAPVAXIVE, which is off to a very strong start, and ENFLONSIA. And on top of that, we have our Animal Health business, where growth will also be driven by new launches, including BRAVECTO QUANTUM, the 12-month injection, as well as NUMELVI, our new dermatology product.

We also have the expectation of continued growth in oncology. To the last question, WELIREG, has strong growth with greater potential ahead of it as we get into other successful studies and treat a broader range of patients. And we do expect continued growth in KEYTRUDA, albeit at a slightly slower pace than we've seen as we are getting to peak penetration in some of the indications, and we do expect some headwind from price in our ex-U.S. markets.

The other headwinds that we will face will be related to loss of exclusivity and generic entrants. And that really is DIFICID that's seen generic entrant halfway through 2025 in the U.S., BRIDION, which will have its LOE partway through 2026. And we also expect the headwind of IRA price setting on the JANUVIA family and the generic entrant for JANUVIA midway through next year. But overall, confident in our ability to continue to positively impact patients and drive solid growth.

Our next question comes from Umer Raffat with Evercore.

Umer Raffat
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I was wondering if I should ask about Organon situation, but I realize it's multiple years removed, stand-alone company. So maybe there's not a whole lot you could say anyways. So let me focus instead on CADENCE trial instead. And Dean, my question is, it finished late September. You're indicating first half '26. It sounds to me like that's a little longer than I would have expected to get the readout out there on 150-patient trial. So could you just catch us up on your thought process there?

Dean Li
Executive VP & President of Merck Research Laboratories

Yes. So just as everyone knows, we have ZENITH, HYPERION earlier in disease, those data have come through. We have a primary completion date of CADENCE this year, and we said that we would be presenting it to the data in a meeting. I believe that we will be putting out a top line once we know it as well. So when we talked about the first half of -- or the first quarter or first half of 2026, we were talking about the full data at a medical meeting.

We are eager to see that result because that result will suggest to us how much we can use WINREVAIR outside of the patient population that's formally PAH. And so we're eager to see those results as well.

Our next question comes from Courtney Breen with Bernstein.

Courtney Breen
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Just coming back to some of the White House price policy pressures and comments you've made already. I wanted to ask this in a slightly different way. If we look at kind of Merck's ratio of revenue today, it's about 50-50 inside the U.S. versus outside the U.S. How different do you expect that to be in 5 years' time? And how much of that could be attributed to product mix? And how much down to kind of equalization of price?

Robert Davis
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, Courtney, thanks for the question. I'm not going to get into specific guidance. Obviously, if you look at where our business is driving, we're excited about the diversity of the pipeline we're bringing. A lot of those opportunities disproportionately will be U.S. based, primarily just because of the nature of the drugs and the uptakes and the value you can assert to the U.S. market. So mix will affect how we look forward. How MFN or other pricing dynamics change, it's too early to say because we need to see what it is. And so I would leave it at that for right now.

Our next question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities.

Vamil Divan
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

So I appreciate the comments around 2026 and how to think about some of the driver there. I had a question just more on GARDASIL. Maybe it's a good thing that we haven't talked much about GARDASIL on this call, but just obviously a challenging year for that product. I'm curious how you think about that product sort of in 2026 and beyond, both in the U.S., where obviously, there's been sort of evolving sentiment around vaccinations and maybe some -- could be an adjustment to the guidelines around the U.S. recommendations, but also then ex-U.S., given you'll be annualizing out of the China and Japan impact. So just any sense of -- I think consensus is expecting a sort of robust return to growth for that product over the next several years. Just curious how you're thinking about that.

Caroline Litchfield
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you for the question, Vamil. So GARDASIL still remains a very important product, and we're really proud of the impact that we're having in helping protect people from certain HPV-related cancers. As we look forward, in the United States indeed today, we are seeing growth in our vaccinations in the 9, 10 age group as well as the mid-adult segment. And that's being offset by a lower level in the adolescent segment, and that's really driven by a reduction in the eligible population, and there are some macro factors there.

As we look forward for the United States, we are hopeful for growth. But clearly, as you mentioned, the ACIP recommendation around that dosing schedule will very much impact whether we do or don't grow in the United States. And as we've said before, we will always look at having the appropriate price point in the United States based on the value that we are providing society.

Outside of the United States, you rightly note that we will lap the impact of China as well as the reduction in the cohort for the catch-up in Japan as we go through 2026. So we look forward to protecting more people around the world.

What we're seeing in countries outside of the United States, some of the public programs have really reached maturity. So we expect a routine cohort to be vaccinated each and every year. The private market is a great opportunity for growth for us. And that's really in the mid-adult segment, age 27 through 45, where we're creating the system to enable people to get vaccinated in many countries around the world. And it's also in some countries in the broad age cohort. So we will be working to activate that cohort. It does take time, but we'll be activating that cohort to drive growth in the private segment as we go forward. Overall, we expect modest growth for GARDASIL in the near term.

Our next question comes from Luisa Hector with Berenberg.

Luisa Hector
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

Just back to KEYTRUDA. Could you just update us on your latest expectations for conversion from IV to subcutaneous and the kind of pace that we could expect? And with that in mind, Caroline, you made a comment on KEYTRUDA growth at a slower pace for '26. So just to check whether that is the overall franchise or IV only? And will you report the sales separately?

Robert Davis
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Luisa, this is Rob. I'll maybe start and then Caroline can address the last part of your question. So if you look at expectations for QLEX, as we've said, it's early in the launch, but everything appears to be on track. And there's no changes to what we previously communicated. We continue to expect that we're going to achieve 30% to 40% patient adoption and that, that will take us out to 18 to 24 months to achieve that. So nothing has changed there. I would highlight, as we've pointed out in the past, that we will have a permanent J-code, but we won't get that probably for 6 months. And during that first 6-month window, you can anticipate a slower uptick just because with people using temporary J-codes, there can be longer reimbursement windows. And so some people will hesitate to order until they have the permanent J-code.

We've done everything we can to learn from the other subcutaneous products that have launched ahead of us. I can tell you that we've put in place, I believe, a commercial contracting strategy that really will make it frictionless to convert patients over, or in the cases of new patients, to adopt the therapy, and that's important to make sure that we are driving this because access and conversion are what is our goal or adoption is the goal we have moving forward.

I'll let Caroline speak to her comments about the overall growth next year.

Caroline Litchfield
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So Luisa, the comments I gave were with regards to KEYTRUDA in its entirety, where we expect KEYTRUDA to slow although it'd be an important contributor to growth for our company. Within that, to Rob's point, we are really excited about the contributions that QLEX can bring as we do provide treatment options for more and more patients as next year unfolds.

Peter Dannenbaum
Vice President of Investor Relations

And we will anticipate reporting separately in 2026.

Our last question comes from Alex Hammond with Wolfe Research.

Alexandria Hammond
Wolfe Research, LLC

On EyeBio, can you help with the Phase III BRUNELLO result in context? What's the bar to deem the trial a success? And I guess given the competitive nature of this indication, how do you plan to execute commercially?

Dean Li
Executive VP & President of Merck Research Laboratories

Well, let me just say that we're really excited about pushing this first-in-class MK-3000 novel candidate targeting the Wnt pathway. I would just remind, I believe this is the first time a novel mechanism has been pushed through in relationship to having clear human genetic evidence for it, and we plan to evaluate that MK-3000, not just in diabetic macular edema, but also neovascular age-related macular degeneration as well.

In terms of commercial sort of execution, I would hold off until we see the data from these trials, but we're pushing very fast and very forward in relationship to this because this could be one of the first new mechanisms, kind of like the WINREVAIR story, where it's the first generally new mechanism that can make a profound effect on such a broad disease.

Robert Davis
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. And maybe just to add a little bit on the commercial opportunity. And if you look at where we are today in the United States, there's about 1.6 million patients with diabetic macular edema. So this is the leading cause of vision loss in people with diabetes. And so as you look at that population, still, there's a very large opportunity because 30% to 40% of patients on therapy are not responsive to the current anti-VEGF. So the ability potentially to see conversions is significant. If you look, it's about a $13 billion market today, and we believe that our ability to drive that kind of conversion with this new molecular entity is important.

As far as the commercial infrastructure, we're really combining the EyeBio's leadership strengths and our expertise in ophthalmology and pushing these forward, and I'm quite confident that we will have the global infrastructure to be able to drive this. We're investing pretty heavily behind this. And when you look at this and combined with the Tiespectus, this is a multibillion-dollar opportunity for the company. We're very excited. I think this is one of the underappreciated areas of what we have, and I credit Dean and the team, they've advanced these by a couple of years from what we originally anticipated when we did the deal. So this is a win in my book.

Peter Dannenbaum
Vice President of Investor Relations

Great. Thank you Alex. Thank you all for your great questions, and we'll end the call there. Please reach out to the IR team if you have any follow-ups.
