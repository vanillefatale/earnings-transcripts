Question-and-Answer Session

Shirish Jajodia

Thank you, Michael. We are now going to proceed to the interactive live Q&A session of our webinar.

I would like to invite all of our Q&A guests to come on video. And we look forward to hearing your questions. We'll go one at a time. I'll call your names and you can direct your question to the management team.

For the first question, I would like to invite Andrew Harte, a research analyst from BTIG. Andrew?

Andrew Harte
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Team, thanks for having me on. I appreciate all the details in the presentation as always. So a lot of our investor questions are focused on the company's ability to pay dividends, especially as the preferred equity strategy continues to grow. Can you just shed some additional color and light on plans to fund those dividends? And then if there was a period where the mNAV compressed or was even below 1x, how could that plan potentially change?

Phong Le
President, CEO & Director

Yes, I can cover this one. And Andrew talked about this a little bit earlier. Right now, our dividends and interest on our convertible notes totaled $689 million annually. And our primary strategy when our mNAV is above 1x is to fund that through ATM issuances. And just to remind everybody, in the last 12 months, we've issued about $27 billion of equity, which means that, that's about the $650 million or so is about 2.6% of how much equity we've raised. So we clearly have the ability to raise equity to cover our dividend payments and our interest.

The big question is what happens when it becomes dilutive to shareholders to issue equity and when we're below 1x NAV or if we go below 1x NAV, what would we do? And there are other things that we've explored and talked about. We would -- we could sell equity derivatives, we could sell Bitcoin derivatives, and we could sell high basis Bitcoin to cover our dividend needs for our preferreds.

What's important when we do those things, and we've talked about it, is we want to preserve the ROC dividends on our preferreds. So we'd have to do them in ways that are avoid positive tax E&P right? We wouldn't do things like sell equity or Bitcoin derivatives that would cause our E&P to be above zero. We are able to sell high basis Bitcoin potentially at a loss and cause negative E&P and offset that with other Bitcoin that would cause positive E&P. We wouldn't sell the software business. I know there are questions about that because that would cause income and positive E&P. And so we want to preserve the ROC dividends, the preferable tax deferred treatment of our preferreds. So those are some of the things that we would do in that scenario. We don't anticipate that scenario, but we do have plans in place.

Shirish Jajodia

Thank you. For the next question, I'd like to invite [ Pierre Rochard ].

Unknown Analyst

Thank you for organizing this, and thank you for the invitation. It was mentioned that there would be marketing and advertising around the preferreds. What do you anticipate that expense looking like? And what the return on investment would be for those efforts?

Phong Le
President, CEO & Director

I can cover that. We're just starting to get into this. Actually, you just saw one of our advertisements for those who like money stretch, right? And so we'll start to experiment with paid advertising on platforms like an X or YouTube.

I think whatever the expense is, it would be quite minimal compared to the increased inflows that we hope to drive into our preferreds, right? And I think we've gone through in the past, if we're able to raise an incremental $1 billion in a preferred, we immediately turn around buy Bitcoin, and that's immediately accretive to Bitcoin yield and Bitcoin per share. I don't expect we're going to spend a ton of money upfront. We'll experiment and see what are the right channels and what causes people to wake up and understand the Bitcoin credit machine that we have.

And then in addition to just digital marketing, we're out meeting with investors, meeting with potential investors quite a bit now. And I think there's just an about a feet on the street between Mike, myself, Andrew, Shirish, CJ and the entire team.

Michael Saylor
Executive Chairman

Yes. I would just piggyback on that by saying, I just spent a lot of time in the Schwab studios and recording content to go on the Schwab network. I was in Vegas at Money 20/20. I was in Austin at a credit conference. I'll be in Naples, Palm Beach. I've got a big road show throughout the Middle East for 1.5 weeks coming up. So there's a lot of outreach. We get invited to speak at a lot of conferences. We also get invited to speak on television, right? So some of the better marketing channels is just go on Bloomberg, go on Fox, go on CNBC. And I think that the difference between what we're doing now and what we're doing a year ago is a year ago, people said, well, what is Bitcoin? Is it going away? And can you sell me on Bitcoin? Now we're beyond the Bitcoin going away. Everybody has embraced it as digital gold. Now when we go on Bloomberg or Fox or CNBC, we're saying, stretch, it's 10.5% dividends tax deferred. You might want to check it out.

So we have it -- by the way, you know how I used to say it takes like 1,000 hours to understand Bitcoin or 100 hours to figure this out. It doesn't take that many hours to figure out that something that yields 10.5% tax deferred is better than your existing money market or bank account. So we've got simpler messages, and we're taking them to every channel. We will try TradFi. We don't think we can sell the Bitcoin message in 30 seconds to 70-year-old conservative traditional retirees. But we do think that we can sell Stretch in 15 seconds or 30 seconds to military retirees that want to live happy ever after. And we know this anecdotally because it's happening everywhere we go, everybody we talk to. It's the simplest product for us to explain. It's hard to sell convertible bonds. It's hard to sell 30-year crypto bonds. It's hard to sell Bitcoin to the rank and file, but everybody wants a bank account that pays 10% that you don't have to pay tax on.

So we're going to work every possible marketing channel in order to get the word out. And the good news there is we're getting an avalanche of request to speak. Everybody wants to talk to us now, right? So just around the time that everybody wants to interview us, everybody wants to talk to us, we have the simplest message. You can put it in 30 seconds. And so it's a very exciting time for marketing.

Shirish Jajodia

Thank you, Pierre. For the next question, I'd like to invite Mark Palmer, our research analyst from Benchmark.

Mark Palmer
The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division

We have already seen the beginnings of consolidation within the digital asset treasury space. Is there a circumstance under which Strategy would step into the market as an acquirer of a Bitcoin treasury company that was trading at a materially lower mNAV in a transaction that would be, by definition, accretive as a means of accelerating its acquisition of Bitcoins.

Michael Saylor
Executive Chairman

I'll give my opinion, and then Phong can chime in. We've done 84 acquisitions of Bitcoin, and every one of them was homogeneous, transparent, and you could instantly calculate whether it's accretive or dilutive, and they were generally all accretive. And our focus is to do high-speed transparent digital transactions and sell digital credit and buy Bitcoin. And we think that it's a big advantage of the company that the business model is so transparent, predictable, clear. Because the business model is predictable, that makes it easy for the equity analysts to make their decisions. And it also makes it easy for the credit analysts to assess the credit quality.

So, generally, we don't have any plans to pursue M&A activity, even if it would look to be potentially accretive. It might be, but there's just a lot of uncertainty, and these things tend to Stretch out six to nine months or a year. And an idea that looks good when you start might not still be a good idea six months later. And it can be very distracting for the management team while you're either integrating or pursuing those things.

So our management team is laser-like focused on selling the four credit instruments that we have and then expanding the reach of our digital credit instruments internationally and, of course, improving the quality of our balance sheet, equitizing the convertible bonds. Those are all the things that we're very excited about.

as an operating company, the great thing about operating company is, yes, you have the option sometime in the indefinite future to do something. And if you're walking down the street and there's $1 billion and you can bend over and pick it up for a nickel, you have the option to do it. And I don't think we would ever say we would never, never, never ever. But what we would say is the plan, the strategy, the focus is sell digital credit, improve the balance sheet, buy Bitcoin and communicate that to the credit and the equity investors.

Phong, do you have anything to add on that?

Phong Le
President, CEO & Director

No, I don't have anything to add. I would generally agree with what you said. We've been a software company for nearly 30 years or over 30 years and software technology M&A is very difficult. There's always something hiding behind what you actually think you purchase. And I think I would say that the same thing is about acquiring Bitcoin treasury companies.

Mark Palmer
The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And just one more question. With regard to your intention to tap international markets from a capital raising perspective, is the idea that you would effectively market the same four perpetual preferred instruments that you currently have, but just to different markets around the world? Or would you be designing new instruments that were specific to those geographies?

Michael Saylor
Executive Chairman

It will be the latter. We will design -- if we're going into Canada, we would design an instrument that's denominated in Canadian CAD, and we would offer it to Canadian investors on a Canadian exchange. So it will be a native product because if you're the investor there, you don't want to take currency risk. And if we go into Europe, we would create a euro-denominated instrument. So -- and we would offer something that represents everything we've learned from the first four credit instruments. If we could improve it, we would. But primarily, the Europeans want a euro currency instrument in Europe and every international investor does.

What we've discovered is a lot of European investors, they can buy the American instruments. So if they wanted a U.S. dollar-based treasury credit instrument, they would buy stretch. And so they can already get to it. In fact, one of the more pleasant surprises I learned is we accumulated a ton of European and British investors in 2020 because they could buy MSTR and they couldn't buy Bitcoin. So our digital credit instruments are already global. If you want U.S. dollar credit instruments, then you're already buying them globally. We think the big unlock is that we can create a digital credit in any currency. We can take JPY risk or we can take euro. We can solve that problem. And there's people that will buy $1 billion of something if they don't have to take the currency risk and they'll buy nothing if they have to take the currency risk.

So our job is to bridge that capital divide. And so when we do it, we'll do it with a native instrument and a native currency on a native exchange that is going to be presumably the most compelling credit instrument in that capital market that anybody has ever seen.

Shirish Jajodia

Thank you, Mark. For the next question, I would like to invite [ Natalie Brunell ].

Unknown Analyst

Beyond Bitcoin price action, can you identify two or three very specific challenges that are serving as headwinds for the growth and performance of strategy and even the Bitcoin treasury industry more broadly? And what actions can be taken to overcome those?

Michael Saylor
Executive Chairman

I think Phong highlighted some of them in the discussion of S&P credit ratings issues, right? The fact that Bitcoin is not viewed as capital by the traditional credit ratings industry.

So I think the view of Bitcoin as -- and the collateral value of Bitcoin and the traditional views under Basel rules under the rules that govern our banking system, our insurance companies and our credit rating agencies. I think that, that's a structural thing. Like when FASB didn't allow you to recognize gains, but they made you recognize losses, and you didn't -- you had indefinite intangible accounting. That was pretty crippling. I think that we fixed that, and I think that fixing capital risk rules will be a big one.

I think the second is banking acceptance, custody and credit banks issuing credit on Bitcoin. So -- we're hearing rumors and we've heard that a number of major banks in the U.S. in the first half of 2026 will start to buy Bitcoin, sell Bitcoin, custody Bitcoin and issue credit and margin lines against the native Bitcoin asset. That will be great for them. That will be great for Bitcoin. That will be great for us. That will accelerate adoption.

And so I would say neither of these are things that I would ask for government help for, like we don't need a law to fix it. What we do need to do is lobby the banks, lobby the insurance companies. Maybe I should replace that word with educate, educate the banks, educate the insurance companies, educate the credit rating agencies. And then finally, educate the traditional fixed income investor, the retiree and the corporate treasurer, educate them that there actually now is a better option. And so I think that's what we need to do in order to grow the industry right now, and that's going to be our focus over the next few years.

Shirish Jajodia

Thanks, Natalie. For the next question, I would like to invite Brian Dobson, research analyst from Clear Street.

Brian Dobson
Clear Street LLC

Yes. So you received a credit rating, and I agree that, that's a very important first step to opening doors at pension funds and insurance companies. I know it's very early days, but are you already having conversations with those investors? And if so, what's the feedback?

And then as a second part to that question, would you have the preferreds and converts rated separately? I mean I think a lot of investors will probably just infer instrument ratings from the general company rating. But what are your thoughts on that?

Phong Le
President, CEO & Director

I can start on that, Brian. We had before we received a rating conversations with large institutions, insurance companies, pension funds that said that they could not easily without significant capital penalties invest in an unrated instrument and that they were quite interested in the structure of what we provided, but just couldn't do it. So that was why we went and pursued a rating with a major rating agency is one of the reasons.

So I do think this opens up doors to some of the categories that you just mentioned before. And I think it's not going to be an avalanche like tomorrow, but as we go out and market and Mike has discussions and I and Andrew all go out in the market and we start talking to these folks, I think their thought process will certainly change over time.

Brian Dobson
Clear Street LLC

Yes. And then I just wanted to follow up on an earlier question about selling into Asia and Europe. Both of those markets represent or have rather unique regulatory hurdles. I guess how far along are you in those markets?

Phong Le
President, CEO & Director

We're pretty far along. You're right, but that's part of the reason why we need to create products that are very specific. What exchange, is it retail focused? Is it institutional focused? Is it regulated? Is it unregulated? What is the tax regime? Look, what we've done since the beginning of the year with preferreds is we went uphill against a market that wasn't familiar with the Bitcoin back perpetual preferred with a return of capital tax structure. And it took us nine months, and we were able to raise $6.5 billion or $6 billion, right? And because we did that, I think we've sort of cornered this market for a good period of time.

I think our ability to go understand the regulatory structures, the tax structures, yes, it's harder than in the U.S. But once we've broken through that, that creates a competitive moat for us to be able to offer products that clearly are superior to what's out there. So we welcome the challenge, I guess, is what I'd say.

Shirish Jajodia

Thanks, Brian. For the next question, I would like to invite [ Adam Livingston ].

Unknown Analyst

Congrats on the great quarter and the credit rating. The Japanese Bitcoin treasury company, Metaplanet, has recently announced a share buyback program with the intention of being able to strategically deploy buybacks at times that would increase Bitcoin per share for the equity holders. Would Strategy ever consider adopting a similar program as a means to increase Bitcoin exposure for shareholders if MSTR ever trades below a 1x mNAV?

Michael Saylor
Executive Chairman

Phong, do you want to start?

Phong Le
President, CEO & Director

Yes, I'll start with that. I don't think there is anything that we wouldn't do that would create incremental Bitcoin yield that increases more Bitcoin per share for our shareholders and preserves our ROC dividends for our preferred holders, right? And so we have an open buyback authorization already. We've done it a long time ago. I think the last buyback we did was 2018 or so. It's not our primary strategy, but it's an option if we were to go down that path.

Mike, do you want to add anything?

Michael Saylor
Executive Chairman

Yes. I would say we're open-minded toward a variety of options. Right now, our preference is to grow the capital base. But if it was compelling enough, we would look at it.

Shirish Jajodia

Thanks, Adam. We have two more questions to go. So for the next one, I will invite Lance Vitanza, our research analyst from TD Cowen?

Lance Vitanza
TD Cowen, Research Division

The 30% BTC yield target for 2025, I'm surprised you maintained it given the recent decel in Bitcoin accumulation. And getting to 30% would seem to require you to raise at least another couple of billion dollars, and we only have 2 months left in the year. You're not going to get there on ATMs alone. Are you currently contemplating a big underwritten transaction perhaps in an overseas market? Is that sort of how you get to the 30%?

Phong Le
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We need to raise roughly $2 billion in a non-dilutive fashion to -- of capital. And you've seen us do that at quick pace in a short period of time. We have two months left to go. And so we'll be racing and we'll see what we can accomplish, right? We're always working, always trying new things, developing new things and this credit factory that Mike talks about, we're very bullish on. Obviously, we can't say exactly what we're going to do when. But it's two good months, 60 days, right before the holidays.

Shirish Jajodia

Great. And for the last question, I will invite Ben Werkman from Strive.

Ben Werkman
Strive Asset Management, LLC

Over the last 12 months, strategy has been extremely successful at building the capital base and expanding the balance sheet using primarily equity in the IPOs from the preferred markets. And over that 12 months, you saw MSTR underperform Bitcoin in a fairly significant manner. Do you guys view the strategic priorities moving forward as focusing more on increasing amplification and less on expanding the balance sheet? And how has this past year informed your go-forward strategy and how you might prioritize the prefs over the common equity moving forward?

Michael Saylor
Executive Chairman

Yes, that's an open-ended question. So I'll start, and then Phong or Andrew may have something to add. Clearly, with equity, I would say, if you're going to own Bitcoin you a four-year or longer time horizon, if you're going to own amplified Bitcoin, a company that aims to be more volatile than Bitcoin, you can't have a lower time horizon. So you probably need a longer time horizon. So we manage the company such that we think 10 years from now, we're going to create an insane amount of shareholder value. And that doesn't mean we're looking for 10-year payoff. We're generally thinking if it doesn't return what we expected within four years, we'd be very disappointed. But we never do anything where we demand to get the payback in four months. And so we don't have a four-month time horizon or even a year time horizon.

And we think that generally, I would say, if your time horizon is 12 weeks, you should own the STRC, right? You really should go to the short end of the risk curve and the short end of the duration curve because that one we're trying to strip volatility away. And if your time horizon is 10 years, and if you are a Bitcoin Maxi, then maybe you like the equity or you like Bitcoin.

The credit instruments, I would say, if we wanted to raise the maximum amount of capital then we could do two things that we don't do. One thing we could do is we could just open up the ATM and we could sell stock at any mNAV, any week all the time. And what you've seen is we don't do that. After the red sweep, when there was a massive enthusiasm, we would sell $1 billion or $2 billion or $3 billion of stock, like $1 billion in a week or $2 billion in a week. And so you see we're not shy when the market is strong and the premiums are high. We would go very hard, but you see a lot of weeks where we sell nothing. And we could have sold $1 billion of equity a week. We chose not to sell any equity. If the equity is weak and it's crashing, it's almost certain. In fact, it is certain we're not the ones doing it, right? We're watching, right? Because our view is we only sell into strength and we only sell in the strength when we like the premium. So we have actively decided we don't want to maximize capital by selling equity.

And then I think the other thing is just like we could raise $1 billion of equity in a few days if we wanted to. I could also pick up the phone and I could raise $1 billion overnight in debt. If I just said we wanted to do a pipe deal with a debt investor, I would have 12 firms over the weekend. And by Monday morning, we could have raised $2 billion, $3 billion, $4 billion, $5 billion, $6 billion. They would be licking their chops and delighted to give us the capital. They would want to be senior to all the other creditors in the capital structure. And what they would do is they would undermine the creditworthiness of the preferred instruments that we actually want to sell.

So you could just assume with our $75 billion of capital right now, we've already chosen not to raise $20 billion or $30 billion. We could be $100 billion, but we'd be $100 billion and the risk profile -- the leverage wouldn't be 11%, the leverage would go up. And so we actively decided that we don't want to generate leverage, right? We're literally on a path to drive leverage down.

We're also on a path -- we've decided we don't want to do deals that don't have positive BTC yield. But more importantly, we're on a mission. The mission is to create the digital credit market. So I think the company has two speeds. Maybe more than two speeds. When we're coasting, when the credit markets don't offer us anything compelling and the equity markets aren't compelling, we are coasting. And in my mind, I think that, that is a $75 billion company growing 30% a year for the next 20 years. So that is idle. And then I -- for those of you who know me, know I believe in the hippocratic oath, do no harm. And so the risk-free rate, the rate -- the company is going to get to 30% a year for 20 years if we take no risk.

So how do we -- what can we do where we feel like it's worthwhile? And of course, if we sell credit, we can take that 30% to 40% or to 50% -- but we have an agenda here. The agenda is not to artfully manage the balance sheet. And it's like if you told me, well, you could issue $10 billion of junk five to seven years and roll them every year and roll them every quarter, and you could pursue a credit strategy based on debt that gets you a lot more capital and you're continually rolling it, and you would do that with 144A offerings. We could like fire up a $2 billion 144A offering next week, and we just go do it.

But the point is we don't want to be the revolutionary company that adopted digital capital that grew the company with conventional traditional credit. We want to be the revolutionary company that discovered digital capital that then went on to discover and found the digital credit market. And when you're just rolling a bunch of five- to seven-year bonds and when you're opportunistic, then you're careening toward the future with an advantage.

I want MSTR to stand for monster. We want to create a monster company. We don't want to Korean toward the future with an advantage. We don't want to be the talented fighter that kind of wins and loses and mostly wins and is a little bit sloppy on disciplined. We want to create the digital credit instruments that are 2x to 4x better than everything in the $300 trillion market, and we want to eat the world, right? And we want to sell $100 billion of them. And after we sell $10 billion, then $20 billion and $40 billion and $80 billion, when people go, well, aren't you levered? We want to say, well, you know actually, our leverage is zero. Wait, what? We have 30% amplification, but we don't have $100 billion of debt. We have $100 billion of equity that happens to actually amplify the common equity.

Let me educate you on a new way to build the company. So I would say you want to boil that down. It's a very disciplined growth strategy. We would rather coast and have a bulletproof balance sheet and a $75 billion company growing 30% a year than to Stretch for capital or Stretch for some kind of yield, but undermine the balance sheet and take on credit risk because someone says, I'll give you $10 billion tomorrow, and it's senior to STRC, we just created volatility and we crumbled the credit of the instrument that is going to provide a comfortable retirement to 1 billion people. I don't want to be the dude that made a good trade that made $25 billion or made $50 billion by trading Bitcoin by using cheap corporate money.

We don't want to be the company the made $25 billion or $50 billion or a Hail Mary or maybe we lost it by whatever borrowing money, however we can get it to buy Bitcoin. We want to be the company that provided a comfortable retirement to 1 billion people and changed the world, right? We want to change the monetary system. I want everybody to get up in America and say, I'm not getting paid 10% tax deferred from my bank or from my money market. That's not fair. That's an abomination. I'm going to tell all my friends I'm going to -- I'm so mad about it. I'm going to go tell my 100 people that I know. They all need to pull their money out of the money market. They need to buy stretch, and we want to be in a position where we can accommodate that demand.

And so what you have is the money that comes easy is always the money that comes with strings attached. And I've learned that over 35, 40 years, and I think the people in the Bitcoin treasury market, they're learning it now. The easy money is the toxic money. What you really want is you want to create a revolutionary new product that solves a problem for $300 trillion of investors and for billions of people. And you know what, when we sell $1 billion worth of digital credit, they're giving us the money forever, and we're taking no credit risk. But the quid pro quo is we're giving them 10% tax deferred, right? And so I would rather pay 10% tax deferred and get the money forever than pay 5% and get the money in the form of a junk bond and pay a taxable 5% coupon. Even if you wanted to give it to me. And then, you can see the obvious reason why. The world is full of 50,000 companies that will give you the 5% taxable. How many companies are in the world that will give you 10% gleefully, enthusiastically as a ROC dividend and then do everything in their power to actually issue more dividends.

So, for us, the credit is the product, right? The aspiration or the offering is a comfortable retirement to everybody who's a credit investor. That's the offering. If we can do it by selling equity, we will. But when the equity is dilutive, we won't. And we won't do debt because debt is a conventional credit idea. It's a 20th century idea. I think I laid out with my seven differentiators of digital credit, we think that digital credit is an inversion of everybody's value system. Every other credit issuer in the world gets up and says, how do I cripple the credit and pay you the lowest coupon and maximize the advantages to my company. And we get up every day and say, how do we create the greatest credit instrument that pays the highest tax equivalent cash flows that's going to be best for the buyer, right, for the investor. So that's the answer to your question, hopefully.

Shirish Jajodia

Excellent. So this concludes the Q&A portion of the webinar. I would like to thank all of our analysts for their questions and all the attendees for tuning in live. We had over 25,000 people across YouTube, X live stream and the Zoom webinar. So thank you all for joining in.

And I will now turn the call over to Phong for the closing remarks.

Phong Le
President, CEO & Director

I also want to thank the analysts for joining us and being on video and asking questions. I want to thank everybody who watched us our earnings call and all of our supporters and all of our shareholders out there. And I invite you all to join us in Las Vegas, February 23 to 26 at the Wynn resort. And for everybody else, have a great holiday season, and we'll see you in three months at our next earnings call. Thank you.
