[Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan.

Jamie Baker
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Look, nothing but accolades from the JPMorgan team. Glen, you've always been so gracious and patient with us. We're really going to miss these interactions. First question for Ed. I know it's early innings, but if this 10% rate cap is codified and becomes reality and withstands legal scrutiny and all that kind of stuff, where does that leave Delta relative to your competitors? I mean you have higher card fees. You lean into premium. If industry loyalty does take a hit, is the natural conclusion that higher-end loyalty outperforms lower end? Or should we be thinking about it differently?

Ed Bastian
CEO & Director

Well, thanks, Jamie, and I could not agree with you more about your comments about Glen. As you said and prefaced, it's way early innings. And so it's really, really hard to speculate. And candidly, the challenges to having that comment of whatever the President is looking to do here are brought into actual delivery. I'm informed it would likely require legislation. And I believe your company was out this morning with some pretty strong comments in terms of their disagreement and willingness to fight that potential order. That all said, we at Delta have the premium card in the industry. The -- no question our -- the value of what we created, distinction, differentiation, if it did come to pass, would be greater.

I think one of the big issues and challenges with the potential order is the fact that it would actually restrict the lower end consumer from having access to any credit, not just what the interest rate they're paying, which would upend the whole credit card industry. So from our standpoint, we'll be working closely with American Express, but I don't see any way we could even begin to contemplate how that would be implemented.

Jamie Baker
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then a follow-up for Glen. And this is actually a retirement-related question. And look, maybe you don't think of these terms, but is there anything about the industry's evolution or Delta's evolution that maybe you, let's say, regret that you won't be at the table for. I mean you obviously have a strong view on what Delta can accomplish going forward. But is there anything in particular that you're just personally disappointed to be missing?

Glen W. Hauenstein
President

I think there's a couple of things I'll mention here. One is the continued evolution of our partnerships. And I think these are the strongest partnerships in the world with the strongest airlines in the world. So whether it's LATAM or whether it's Korean, these are very, very deep relationships, which I think are still in their infancy. And I think one of the things that's underappreciated is also we have equity stakes in all of them. And so we are at the table with them. And I do think that one of my counsels to Julie is that continue to highlight that because those are winning carriers and their stocks are appreciating well as well. And I think that's undervalued in our valuation.

So I think that the international -- continued expansion of international, the new fleets, like if you're an airline nerd like I am, who doesn't like to see how the new fleets perform once they get here. The continue -- another thing I think is undervalued at Delta is the fact that we've made these generational builds that can really sustain growth for Delta over the next 15 to 20 years without incremental CapEx into facility. So seeing those -- seeing the Salt Lake City facility that we've just built get used over the next 10 to 15 years, there's so much I'm going to miss. There's so much I'm not going to miss too. Controlling your own calendar is key at this age, as you realize you don't have infinity left in the world. So there are so many exciting things at Delta. And the team is really an extraordinary team and the people of Delta have just been amazing to get to know over the past 20 years. So there's tons I'll miss. Thanks to that interesting question.

Your next question is coming from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank.

Michael Linenberg
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I want to echo Jamie's words. I mean, Glen, you're an industry thought leader and innovator. I mean always willing to push the envelope. I mean I just -- I feel privileged to have had the opportunity to have learned from you for all these years. So thank you.

Glen W. Hauenstein
President

Thank you for the kind words.

Michael Linenberg
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And I guess with that, you'll get my last question. I have really only one question here and just sort of drilling down. I mean this acceleration that we are seeing on demand from the fourth quarter into the March quarter, I mean, you talked about all groups and all geographies. But as I recall, in the past, you did talk about that the leverage was maybe going to be in main cabin in 2026. And I wonder whether or not you are seeing that the lower end of the fare structure is truly moving up and that's helping to drive that acceleration. And combined with that, just the booking curve, I mean, is there any -- have we seen the booking curve really shift back to normality? Or are there any sort of idiosyncrasies about that curve that are maybe helping that acceleration? So just the revenue down.

Glen W. Hauenstein
President

Sure. The revenue has definitely accelerated here, and we're very excited about it, and it's across all entities, it's across all geographies. And the booking curve really hasn't moved out that far. It's just kind of returned to a more normal level. I think what happened in the fourth quarter, it was all over the place, right, is that by the time we got to the shutdown in November and we had the Secretary of Transportation questioning the safety of air traffic control, there was a lot of noise in fourth quarter.

And so -- but I do think if we took out that noise and saw where we were in October and see where we are sitting today, we are a step above where we were in October, which was a fantastic month for the company. And what's really exciting about the return of business as we head into '26 is '25 grew. I think it's 8% it grew. But it was mostly on fare. And right now, we're seeing both fare and traffic. And so seeing that traffic come back is, I think, a really good start to 2026.

Operator

Your next question is coming from John Godyn from Citi Research.

John Godyn
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I wanted to kind of follow up on the concept of accelerating trends as well, but specifically on corporate demand and what you're seeing there. It sounds like the numbers at the start of the year are quite good. And I was curious, is that the broader environment? Is that market share gains? Anything you can say to help us unpack that would be fantastic.

Glen W. Hauenstein
President

Well, I think it is the broader market. I do think that Delta's market share has never been higher. But that's a gradual -- that's year after year, knocking away 0.5 point, 0.5 point, 0.5 point. So I think our market share is in a fantastic position, but -- and it's at all-time highs, but I do think it's a much broader than just Delta at this point. Joe, do you have any comments?

Joe Esposito
Senior Vice President of Network Planning

No, I think we're setting up for a really good economy, and everybody can feel that. And the corporate environment is optimistic about their travel plans for the future. So I think those things are lining up for a positive 2026.

John Godyn
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Got it. And if I could just ask a follow-up on that. Just broadening up and linking it to the guidance a little bit. Obviously, an accelerating environment is fantastic. Are we in a situation where things need to accelerate even further and step even higher to get us to the high end of the annual guidance or even exceed it? Or if we just saw these trends continue that you're observing right out of the gate, that's enough to get us there. I'm just trying to sensitize the guidance.

Ed Bastian
CEO & Director

John, it's Ed. I appreciate that question. And it's the second week in January. It's really hard to take a few weeks of bookings and reach any kind of early conclusion. We're encouraged by what we saw. And absolutely, if the momentum that we currently see continues, we'll be fine, we'll do well on our guidance range. That said, we also learned of the volatility. We're reminded of the volatility of the industry this past year. And we want to make certain that we have a bit of caution as we project how we'll do.

Glen W. Hauenstein
President

Let me just add one thing because I didn't -- in retrospect, I didn't really answer Mike Linenberg's question about main cabin. And we have not really seen main cabin move yet. So I think when you think about the higher end of our guide, that would definitely be the main cabin starting to move. And I do think that it will move in '26, we just have not seen it yet.

Your next question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research.

Conor Cunningham
Melius Research LLC

Echoing everyone else, Glen, congrats on the retirement. We've learned a ton from you over the years. So thanks again. Maybe I could -- maybe I can kick it over to Joe actually. So I mean, I was hoping you could just talk about your priorities as you take on the new role. You've obviously helped mold the Delta network for a long time. But just curious how you approach things with the commercial hat on and if the strategy changes at all. Just any thoughts there would be helpful.

Joe Esposito
Senior Vice President of Network Planning

Yes. Thanks, Conor. Overall, I feel very fortunate and grateful for working with Glen for 20-plus years now. And we've learned so much, and we've been there from the beginning of transforming Delta. I think that theme though carries over into consistency and continuity. Our strategies aren't changing. In fact, I mean, we're going to be digging even deeper into those strategies for further integration. I think the integration is still in the early innings of how we go to market from a complete commercial perspective. It used to be network and price, now it's so much more with the consumer and Amex and what we do for the customer and club. So I mean there's lots of runway ahead for us in product deployment. We've been doing this for over 15 years, and I think there's still a lot more runway to go in where we're going on the product side.

We're in the early stages of merchandising. There's more to do with Amex, premium products and the fleet that we're getting for the future is really exciting. So I think there's a lot to look forward to. There's a lot to build off of what we've already done. And I'm honored to lead the commercial team and proud to work with a really talented group of people that support us, both not only within the commercial organization, but operationally. So again, I want to thank Glen for all we've done together. And I think there's a lot more to do.

Conor Cunningham
Melius Research LLC

Great. And maybe I can -- Glen, maybe you want to jump in too, it's up to you. But like just on the geographies in general, as you look about -- you talked a little bit about main cabin on the U.S. side. And I think the overall assumption from a lot of us is that there's a lot of opportunity in the U.S. domestic market, but international has been wildly resilient and obviously picked up again in the fourth quarter. So if you could just talk about your expectations for Transatlantic and Asia and so on, that would be super helpful.

Glen W. Hauenstein
President

Do you want to take it, Joe?

Joe Esposito
Senior Vice President of Network Planning

Yes, I'll take it. The Transatlantic and Pacific resiliency come from, I think, years of building the domestic network to have that strong foundation to launch from. You take the loyalty of cities, you think about New York, Los Angeles, Boston and new gateways we've been able to expand with. You layer on top of that new airplanes being able to monetize that premium cabin. So I think the -- a lot of it is coming together and the order of the 787 is just another future marker out there for innovation and especially when you think about in the wide-body space, fleet efficiency is really what wins the day. If you think about taking a 767 and replacing it with a 350 or 787 drives that incremental margin, drives better product and drives incremental margin.

Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley.

Ravi Shanker
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Glen, obviously, congratulations on an incredible career. You will be tremendously missed, but I'm also very envious of your upcoming travel plans. So please [indiscernible]. Maybe a couple of -- maybe I'll start with my follow-up here. Obviously, lots of questions on a strong start in January. Glen, do you have any indication that there's been maybe some pent-up demand from 3Q or 4Q that's now coming on maybe in corporate or international, which may kind of maybe question the sustainability of the strength? Or do you not think so?

Glen W. Hauenstein
President

As Ed mentioned in his opening remarks, '25 had some very choppy points in it. And I think there was a lot of reason for people to hesitate to travel at different points in the year for different reasons. And so as we look at '26, assuming that the core demand stabilizes, there is huge upside for us across all entities, I think. So especially as you get to the latter part of the first quarter and into the second quarter where the tariff uncertainty and the economic uncertainty was kind of hitting the crescendo, I think that's what gives us confidence that '26 is going to be a great year.

Ravi Shanker
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Understood. That's helpful. And maybe also if you guys could unpack the previous response on the 787s. Again, what was the rationale for that aircraft versus 350 or maybe some others? And also, it almost sounds like you're planning to deploy them differently than your existing wide-bodies or on very specific routes. So any clarity there would be helpful even though I know that's some way off.

Joe Esposito
Senior Vice President of Network Planning

Yes. Thanks, Ravi. I think it's a natural evolution in our fleet. When you think about -- I think our priorities up into this point was to get critical mass into the 350 and the 339 and we're well on our way to do that, and that drives great efficiency and that efficiency is needed in the wide-body category. When we look out into the future, the 787 is a great airplane, financially, a great airplane. We're able to do a lot with the 10 version of this on the premium seating. It's a great cargo airplane. And it also drives diversification within our fleet, both not only on the airframe but on the engine side. So it's a natural fit, especially when it starts to replace the 767-400s, which it's slated to do. It's designed for growth and replacement. And when you think about swapping a 764 or 763 to a 787-10, it's a very powerful change in a step function improvement in margin.

Glen W. Hauenstein
President

I can be a little flippant here -- since it's my last call, I can be a little flippant and say, this one is too hard. This one is too soft. This one is just right. If you remember, I think that was Goldilocks and the Three Bears. We have 3 fleets and one has long range, one has a lot of capabilities, one is a category killer on CASM. And one is kind of our milk run airplane that's going to do most of the spoke services out of our core hubs. So I think we've got a really good array just like we do domestically, where we can go all the way from the 76-seater up to -- and so I think this gives us a lot of versatility moving forward and best-in-class core economics.

Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James.

Savanthi Syth
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

And I'd like to echo all the kind of glowing commentary on Glen, and congratulations to both Glen and here -- and what I would like to actually maybe ask a 2-part question that's very similar on the operations side. Delta has really differentiated itself in terms of kind of reliability and recoverability historically, it was kind of once described to me by one of your pilots as a Swiss watch that was dismantled during COVID and had to be put back together. So first, I was wondering if you could provide an assessment on how operational reliability and recoverability stacks up today compared to where it was during COVID.

And second, with kind of many of your competitors looking to kind of meet the standard that you have set, what's your assessment on how your relative performance has evolved? And is that still a strong differentiator, especially as you have your [ pilot ] contract discussions?

Ed Bastian
CEO & Director

Savi, this is Ed. Let me take a stab at that. There's no question that we have work to do with respect to the resiliency of our recovery from irregular operations. We're working off of a great foundation. We just were named last week by Cirium as the most on-time airline in North America. So it's not as if we're -- we've got a big hole to fill. But that said, with a lot of the change post COVID, including some pretty significant changes in our pilot contract in terms of how we route and reroute and schedule pilots, particularly at times of change, have caused some difficulties in providing the level of reliability that we like in the recovery aspect. So we're all hands on deck in that regard.

We know what the factors are that's been driving us. It's just going to take us a little bit of time to get after, but we're working very, very closely with our flight ops team, our maintenance team, our technology team, our ops control team as well as with the pilots union to ensure -- because our pilots don't like some of the recovery challenges with that either to make certain that we return to the top, not just in on time, but also an overall recovery.

Savanthi Syth
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

And can I -- just a follow-up on that. As you think about your comparison and your competitors really trying to kind of meet that standard that you've set, like is there something in how Delta approaches this that [indiscernible] maintains your leadership? Or how should we think about that? And how is that in terms of all the corporate discussions that you're having?

Ed Bastian
CEO & Director

Well, I think we're #1 across the board in almost every metric in this industry that you can look at. So I don't believe we've lost our leadership in total. But yes, I think that -- listen, we said all along, I've said all along, we want there to be a healthier industry, a higher-quality form of experience for customers that, forget Delta, everyone can see the industry in a much better and more reliable light. And I think one of the great things that Delta has done for the industry is raised the bar and the spotlight on what can be done collectively on many levels. And this will be the next opportunity for us.

Glen W. Hauenstein
President

I just want to echo what Ed said is that a better industry makes for selling more tickets at an industry level, not just at Delta level. And so raising the bar is a great thing for the industry.

Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI.

Duane Pfennigwerth
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Glen, I was struggling with what to get you. I thought I'd ask you one last question as a parting gift, but congratulations. If we go back into the archives of your early career, maybe back to the days trying to restructure Alitalia. What are the biggest surprises in how the industry and how Delta evolved relative to what you might have thought at that point in your career?

Glen W. Hauenstein
President

I think Ed and I have shared this journey together. And when you think about where we entered Delta, I think a lot of people would look and say, well, why do you go there? Because it was in such trouble at the time we joined. And so I remember to this day that I wrote Jerry Grinstein a note saying that I wanted to help restore Delta back to its rightful place at the top of the U.S. aviation industry. And I think -- not to sound bold or arrogant, but I think we could say mission accomplished on that. And I think it's underappreciated how much hard work it was and how many bold things we had to do to get here.

And I think that's what I would impart on you and our team is in order to stay here now, you have to continue to be bold. You have to continue to look beyond what the next quarter is or what the next year is and look what the next decade looks like and where do you want this company to be 10 years from now. And I think this team does that every day. And I'm really proud to be a part of that, and I know the future is going to be super exciting.

Duane Pfennigwerth
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Congratulations, again. And then just to switch gears on MRO. Maybe, Dan, you're providing increased transparency. Can you speak a little bit about the outlook for that segment, revenue growth, margin expansion and if there are any capital commitments embedded in the CapEx outlook for this year?

Daniel Janki
Executive VP & CFO

Sure, Duane. Thank you. Quite optimistic about the MRO business. I think they had a really good 2025, great commercial wins building the backlog. I think this is a business that we're excited to see across the $1 billion mark and one that we continue to hold out and see it as a 2 -- then getting to $2 billion and then getting to $3 billion of top line that it can continue to grow. This is a business that where it's positioned, it's high single-digit margins today, it should be mid-teens and one that we have [indiscernible] capital, but it's one of those things that you just have to consistently stay after as it relates to both shop capacity, but also repair capability and how you think about it.

It's something that Delta team is pulling off a really strong maintenance capability and that we can extend to third party. So we're quite excited about it. We do think it is one of those elements that truly is unique to Delta and related to our differentiation and durability, and that's why we want to make sure that we provide you that -- our investors with that transparency over time.

Your next question is coming from Chris Wetherbee from Wells Fargo.

Christian Wetherbee
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And congrats, Glen. Obviously, we haven't got to spend a lot of time together, but your reputation certainly transcends. So congrats and enjoy the next leg of the journey here. I guess I wanted to ask a question about premium versus main cabin. Obviously, the revenue growth spread has been very wide here in the back half of '25. So as we think about sort of a normalization and maybe improvement as we go through '26, what can that sort of spread look like? Obviously, capacity is going to be weighted towards premium, but what do you think normal looks like at that relationship?

Glen W. Hauenstein
President

Well, the margin spreads, as you indicated, have never been greater. And as you know, the bottom end of the industry and the commodity side of the business has been struggling greatly. And so I do think there's -- we saw consolidation earlier in the week. We're waiting to see what happens with Spirit here as it continues to try and restructure. But that sector has been unable to grow here for the last several years. And when that sector is not growing, it can't contain its CASM, as CASM goes up significantly every quarter, more than ours.

And so that's become a real challenge for that sector in the industry. I don't -- Scott Kirby would say, it's only math, but I think that challenge continues to haunt that side of the industry, and it has to rebalance itself at some point. And the only way it can do that is to get their revenue basis up because their costs aren't going down. And so it's taken longer than I would have thought to be quite honest. But I believe it's still to come, and that is pure upside to us.

Christian Wetherbee
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. That's super helpful. And then I guess a quick follow-up. Just as you think about the guidance ranges that you guys have given, it seems like there's a path towards the upside of that. I guess what are the things that we should be thinking about as risk to the downside outside of obvious macro challenges that may arise? But I guess in terms of the trends that you're seeing so far, they're relatively robust. Anything we should be thinking about it could be 1Q or as we think out a little bit further into 2026.

Ed Bastian
CEO & Director

This is Ed. So the risks, you don't have to go too far to think about what the risk could be. Just look at last year and where we were a year ago, we thought we were going to have a banner year and gave guidance kind of similar to what we're giving today, and it got derailed a little bit. So I think the new year offers optimism for a different outlook than we were a year ago. I think relative to the administration and their priorities, I think we're all 1 year smarter and more conditioned to expect maybe the unexpected in some of the policy approach. And I think we're -- if you look at the economy, if you look at the strength of the market and you look at how not just airlines are looking at it, looking at how high-end consumers are feeling about our -- about their opportunities, they're quite bullish. And so that's how I'd frame it.

Operator

Your next question is coming from Andrew Didora from Bank of America.

Andrew Didora
BofA Securities, Research Division

Actually, just wanted to touch upon the free cash flow generation here. I think it's obviously very unique to Delta. But Ed, Dan, today, you're giving us all a closer look at MRO, loyalty and the like. When you look at the drivers of this free cash flow generation year in, year out, how much of this comes from these ancillary businesses versus the core airline? Does it over-index? Is it a bigger percentage of free cash flow then as a percentage of your revenues?

Daniel Janki
Executive VP & CFO

The -- when you think about it, free cash flow is ultimately driven by your margins and drive your operating cash flow. So I would say the loyalty premium, certainly, given its margin profile, has an outsized impact on it. Things like MRO that are smaller, things like cargo have less impact than the core, but premium would be outsized related to it.

Andrew Didora
BofA Securities, Research Division

That makes sense. And when we think about kind of this free cash flow going forward, when we think about the CapEx side of the equation, any step-up in CapEx coming over the next few years, maybe particularly because of the new Boeing order this morning, anything there to think about?

Ed Bastian
CEO & Director

Andrew, this is Ed. No. We've been very consistent over the last decade of CapEx in that $5 billion, some years a little lower, some years a little higher range. And while clearly, there could be a one-off, maybe a year with a little bit more, broadly speaking, no, we're very disciplined about that. And I think one of the real exciting opportunities for Delta when you look at where our leverage ratio is, where it's going, the continued free cash flow generation. And I said on CNBC this morning, I think the most tangible return we can generate for our shareholders is that free cash flow opportunity. And as the balance sheet continues to be delivered, there's going to be even more return possibilities for our shareholders. It's not going to go into starting to try to get on a big growth spurt. That's not an answer that -- we've seen people try that in the past, that never ends up well.

Your next question is coming from David Vernon from Bernstein.

David Vernon
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

Glen, all the best for the future. Just kind of looking at the bigger picture around the commentary that you guys have provided today, it sounds like Delta revenue is accelerating, but the main cabin isn't. And I'm just wondering if that more plainly just means that this is about Delta and the strategies you guys put in place kind of working for Delta and maybe the industry outlook is a bit more mixed. And if that's right, what does that mean for like kind of competitive capacity as you're looking out at the market for 2026, particularly in relation to your hubs and where capacity is shifting in the marketplace? Is it right to think that maybe you guys have started to carve out a path that's a little bit easier to glide through a more mixed sort of industry outlook?

Glen W. Hauenstein
President

Well, I think that's what '25 was a proof point on is that the industry, if you look at it, was very challenged in '25, and Delta was at the very top of the industry. And I believe when everybody reports, this is -- my hypothesis is that we will never have been in our past a higher percentage of the industry's total profits than we were in '25. And so as you think about what's working here at Delta, the diversification of the revenue streams, the continued focus on premium products and services, I think, yes, we have charted a different path.

And we don't control what decisions are made at other airlines, but I do think that those who cater to more commoditized, you've seen them trying to change, right? You've seen Southwest going in a very different direction, talking about clubs, talking about international. So I do think we have charted our own path, and I do think there's a lot of upside. The tremendous upside for us when the industry finally does reckon with the fact that the commodities are not making any money, and they either have to be removed or they have to be upgraded.

David Vernon
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

And as far as kind of competitive capacity, as you like last year, were talking about how competitive capacity is a little more subdued in your core hubs. Obviously, the industry entered in a very different position in terms of what it thought its growth aspirations are going to be last year. But I'm just wondering is there also a little bit of a parting of the Red Sea for you guys around some of your core hubs.

Joe Esposito
Senior Vice President of Network Planning

Well, I think -- this is Joe. Looking at competitive capacity, it's in a really good place for us as we start the year. I think to your earlier comments, the bottom side of the industry has got -- has been and will continue to rationalize that capacity. And you've seen a lot of the unprofitable part coming out. But it's their only -- when you look at how they are going to come out of this, it's either going to be an internal or external restructuring. So the competitive capacity, we said is good today. We offer our customers great products in our own hubs, and we're very competitive in all of our hubs.

Your next question is coming from Michael Goldie from BMO Capital Markets.

Michael Goldie
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Revenue diversification continues with non-main cabin CapEx kind of getting to that 61%, 61.5% this quarter. Seat growth is really concentrated in premium going forward. Where do you see this non-main cabin revenue mix over the longer term? Is it 65%, 70% in the coming years?

Glen W. Hauenstein
President

I don't think we're seeking out a number here. We're reacting to how customers behave and how the industry constructs it. So again, as we talked about the margins being in the premium products right now, at some point, this is going to shift, and it will shift to have -- hopefully, the premiums not go down, but the main cabin go up because that's just how the math has to work. And so I think as you look forward to that, that's clearly upside for Delta, but some place the industry has to go. And I think we thought that it would happen before now. But it's taken a long time. But it's happening. It's happening with capacity reductions, it's happening with consolidation, and it will continue to happen around us until main cabin returns accelerate.

Michael Goldie
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

And as a follow-up on the industry consolidation, we saw this week, you've had Hawaiian, a year or 2 ago Spirit. When you step back, do you think the landscape will see further consolidation in the coming years or eventually find a plateau?

Ed Bastian
CEO & Director

I think it's very clear that you're going to see further rationalization. It can come in lots of forms. It could be in consolidation, it could be liquidation, could be internal, can be external drivers as we've seen in the industry with activists involved. But I think you're going to see rationalization in any carrier that's not earning its cost of capital is already experiencing significant duress and distress amongst their ownership base and they need to continue to work to enhance their business models.

Catherine O'Brien
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

And Glen, another congratulations on such an amazing career. It's really been a pleasure getting to work with you. And I hope you're looking forward to a lot more time in Italy in 2026. And maybe just speaking of international destinations, maybe a shorter-term one. But could you walk us through how you're thinking through sequential trends across each of your geographies in 1Q on a RASM basis. It all sounded positive in the prepared remarks. So just I guess any bright spots that stand out in particular?

Glen W. Hauenstein
President

I'll let Joe take that question because I'm easing out of this, reading these reports every morning. So he's probably more up-to-date than I'm.

Joe Esposito
Senior Vice President of Network Planning

I think our sequential trends in international and domestic are both really positive as we go into 2026. So we've seen the most sequential trends international from third quarter to fourth quarter. We had identified more of a blip for the summer of 2025, and that played out the way we wanted to as improving those trends as we went along. And I think that's going to continue, especially with -- as we go into 2026. If you look at the Transatlantic, competitive capacity looks really good as we go forward in the summer. And looking forward, our partners are well positioned. I think we're expanding conservatively, but from a position of strength. And the traveling public is very excited about new destinations.

If you look at where we've added this year into -- and we put that out to our loyalty program for a vote. So we're doing some kind of unique things and some exciting things. On the Pacific side, our cornerstone with the Pacific is Korean Air, and they're a great partner. And we've built our foundation around the Incheon hub and also now expanding a little bit beyond that into the biggest economies. So we've seen really good progression as Korean and Asiana work through their merger. The Incheon hub has been a fantastic hub to connect through. So there's only greater upside into pushing our traffic through Incheon and also making sure we have access to some of the biggest economies out there like Taipei, Hong Kong, and there will be a few others later in the next couple of years.

And finally, in Latin America is kind of 2 different entities. You've got the short haul, which acts very much like domestic, short haul in the Caribbean and Central America. And that moves with domestic and is much more of a leisure operation for us. And we've had a very good Christmas. We've got really good strength in the Christmas bookings, good strength in spring break. And so some of what you're seeing in close-in bookings and cash sales really goes to the leisure side of spring break. You've got March, April and Easter, and that also includes the short-haul Latin America. And then with our partner, LATAM in South America, further integration into their hubs. They just opened up -- the Lima Airport is fairly new in how we move traffic efficiently through South America. They've got fantastic hubs that they continue to develop, which is only a positive for us for the future.

Catherine O'Brien
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Got it. And maybe just like very -- I just want to make sure that international, you're expecting a bigger sequential improvement versus domestic into the first quarter, is that what you said?

Joe Esposito
Senior Vice President of Network Planning

They're both moving at the same rate, I would say, as we go into the first quarter. I think with international, we have good margin upside. We've closed a lot of those gaps over the years from international to domestic. And there's more, especially when you think about using the fleet and premium products for international.

Catherine O'Brien
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And if you guys will allow it, maybe just a bit of a follow-up to your answer to Andrew, Dan. As you work towards your 2 turns leverage this year on your way to 1 turn, can you remind us how increasing shareholder returns fits into your capital allocation priorities? I think back at Investor Day, Ed might have noted that you wouldn't necessarily need to be at 1.0 turns of gross leverage to consider share repurchases. What factors go into that calculus?

Ed Bastian
CEO & Director

Thanks, Catie. You're right. We don't have to be exactly at 1x gross leverage in order to expand the range of shareholder return capabilities and opportunities to create. And every step that we take getting closer to that time is -- time continues to afford us those opportunities. First, starting with, as we've done the growth of the dividend rate, which we hopefully will continue. Last year, we put a shelf on the table for repurchase. And it was a 3 year, and I certainly expect we'll be utilizing that over the course of that time frame. And obviously, looking at the multiple and where it's headed, our priority is very clear for this year. It's continued to pay down debt. But as the year and the next couple of years ago, you're going to see more opportunities explored, and I'll leave it at that.

Julie Stewart
Vice President of Investor Relations

Matthew, we'll now go to our final analyst question, Tom Fitzgerald at Cowen.

Operator

Certainly. Tom Fitzgerald, your line is live.

Thomas Fitzgerald
TD Cowen, Research Division

Congrats, Glen. Just curious on -- at Investor Day, you talked a lot about the revenue segmentation and further aligning value with price. So I'd love to hear what's next for that this year. And then on the technology side, just curious with all the advances we're seeing every day, where do you guys see some low-hanging fruit as we move through 2026?

Glen W. Hauenstein
President

I think we've talked about really having 3 categories for every product, which is basic, main and extra. And that continues to evolve. I think we put those products in place for Comfort+ earlier in the year, and that implementation is producing results that are actually slightly above our internal projections. So as you see us continue to bring that and move that up the ladder to give customers choice not only of the seat, but the actual product that they want to buy with that seat and really disaggregating that out. And that should be rolled out pretty much throughout '26 and as part of our initiatives and our Delta initiatives in our plan.

And hopefully, those exceed our own expectations of how people select because I think that if you were offered a $500 ticket, there was no reason for you to ever want to pay more than $500 because it was fully loaded. Now we have that seat is $500, but you can buy it for $450 if you're willing to get the seat assignment at 48 hours, if you're willing to have it nonrefundable and then all the way up to extra where it's fully refundable and you get the best seats unlocked at that time. So I think it's the seat and then it's the product attributes, and we'll be bringing that in '26. That's one of our '26 initiatives. Joe, do you want to add anything?

Joe Esposito
Senior Vice President of Network Planning

No. No, that's exactly right. And we've been incredibly thoughtful about not going too fast, making sure that we're measured in that approach. We're still testing Comfort Basic right now. We're going to expand that for the rest of this year. The great thing is when you think about merchandising is the products you're able to put in there. And we've got a lot of products. We're innovating with more products, and there's just more we can offer the customer based on what they're willing to pay.

Glen W. Hauenstein
President

And I think that's the key to merchandising in the future. This is -- if you look further out, this continues to be multibillion dollars opportunities in here to add high-value, lower cost, lower margin -- higher-margin products that we don't have on the shelf today. And that's really what our retailing tools are going to enable over the next several years.

Julie Stewart
Vice President of Investor Relations

Okay. That will wrap up the analyst portion of our call. I'll now turn it over to Trebor Banstetter to open the media potion.

Trebor Banstetter

Thank you, Julie. Matthew, if you could read the instructions to the media for queuing up for questions, and then we'll get into the final part of the call.

Operator

Certainly. At this time, we'll be conducting a Q&A session for media questions. [Operator Instructions] There are no media questions in the queue at this time.

Julie Stewart
Vice President of Investor Relations

All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to talking with you again in April.

Operator

Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation today.
