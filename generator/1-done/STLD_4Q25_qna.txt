Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Katja Jancic with BMO Capital Markets.

Katja Jancic
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Maybe starting on the aluminum rolling mill. Mark, I think you said that the mill is expected to reach 90% utilization by the end of '26. Is that correct?

Mark Millett
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

That's correct. And I think -- that's a little sooner than we've, I think, talked in the past. But what we're seeing from the team and from the equipment, it's given us a strong confidence that, that can be achieved.

Katja Jancic
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

And then given that the mill reached or was EBITDA positive in December, and when looking at the current aluminum and the Midwest premium environment, how should we think about the profitability over the next few quarters?

Mark Millett
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

Well, I would -- we anticipated that, that positive EBITDA profile will continue through the year.

Theresa Wagler
Executive VP, CFO & Company Secretary

So Katja, we're going to be ramping up. So there's still -- as Mark mentioned on his opening remarks, we're still commissioning and constructing some of the downstream facilities, if you will. And so that will have an impact to the first half of the year. But we do expect to remain and be improving EBITDA throughout the first half of the year. And then the second half of the year really is about product mix optimization.

Our next question is coming from Lawson Winder with Bank of America Securities.

Lawson Winder
BofA Securities, Research Division

What I'd like to do is just kind of ask a question along the lines of investment and not necessarily M&A, but into growth, too. When you think about your balance sheet and the amount of debt that you could potentially take on, whether for some sort of acquisition or for a major investment into new capacity, where do you kind of see the upper limits of your comfort level?

Theresa Wagler
Executive VP, CFO & Company Secretary

Thanks for the question, Lawson. So we do have a balance sheet that actually has a considerable amount of capacity. When we look at where we'd like to be on a through-cycle basis, we're very direct about being less than 2x on a net realized basis, and we're well under 2x today as we said from a liquidity and debt perspective. So there is room to move. And that is also in light of the fact that our structural EBITDA is actually improving. So that $1.4 billion that we talk about associated with aluminum and sitting in the 4 value-added lines hasn't really begun to be realized in any meaningful way yet. So all of that is adding extra capacity to the balance sheet as well.

We are incredibly committed to the investment-grade markets but there's a lot of room in our ratings to be able to add that capacity. So I won't talk about necessarily a top range. I'll just say on a through-cycle basis, we definitely will remain under a 2x net levered basis.

Our next question is coming from Tristan Gresser with BNP Paribas.

Tristan Gresser
BNP Paribas, Research Division

Just a quick follow-up on the aluminum. If you expect to reach kind of targeted utilization rate by year-end, and I understand your product mix might not be fully optimal by then. But given the current pricing environment, is it fair that by year-end this year, you should get to your -- at least to your targeted margin profile into Q4, at least those months in Q4?

Theresa Wagler
Executive VP, CFO & Company Secretary

If you're referring to the through-cycle $650 million to $700 million EBITDA estimate, is that what you're trying to...

Tristan Gresser
BNP Paribas, Research Division

Yes.

Theresa Wagler
Executive VP, CFO & Company Secretary

So what we've said in the past is that actually the margins that we are achieving -- not achieving today. The margins on a market basis that are available today are actually higher than what we projected on a through-cycle basis for the investment itself, just given where the Midwest transaction price, et cetera. So there is that opportunity, I think, more quickly. Yet, we're still working through start-up. We're still working through all of those items. So we're not prepared today to talk about what profitability might look like in the fourth quarter of this coming year but all the market factors are positioned to actually give us a significant advantage over what we had modeled on a through-cycle basis.

Tristan Gresser
BNP Paribas, Research Division

All right. That's clear. And if you allow me a quick follow-up. Just on Sinton, if you can give us an update. I think there were a press report of some incident in January. And if you could talk a little bit about the volume outlook into Q1 for the steel business, that would be also appreciated.

Barry Schneider
President & COO

Lawson, this is Barry. With regards to the incident here at the beginning of the year, we did have a transformer failure at the Sinton facility. It was one of the high-voltage transformers in the yard. This was an original transformer. And I think as we talked about publicly, we had some transformer issues at that facility we were starting up. We believe this transformer was subjected to some of that stress on the system early. So we have been monitoring it.

We took the opportunity a couple of years ago to actually go out and buy significant amounts of other transformers that we have engineered into the system. So we don't have any concerns of ongoing problems. We believe we've rectified the original engineering and locational challenges we had down there. So all in all, it was a great job by the Sinton Fire Department. It was rather demonstrative, the failure, but nobody was injured. The damage was limited to the transformer itself and operations resumed shortly after the plant was safe, which was within the 12 hours or so of the incident.

So we don't expect any ongoing concerns. And the team has done a good job of getting the backup resources. It's very difficult to get transformers in this world. So they acted quickly a couple of years ago to make sure we had the right stuff spared and installed. So we feel good about where we're going. And it was unfortunate but onward, upward with Sinton.

Operator

Our next question is coming from Tim Tanners with Wells Fargo.

Timna Tanners
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Regarding the $1.4 billion structural contribution, I feel like we talked about aluminum. But just can you give us any updated thoughts on the status of the 4 value-added lines that have been ramping up? And just remind us where Sinton is. I know it's still -- the Slide 9 shows us that it's still running a little lighter than the rest of your operations. When can we expect that to maybe converge?

Theresa Wagler
Executive VP, CFO & Company Secretary

Yes. Thank you. It's good to talk to you again, Timna. So from the perspective of the $1.4 billion, just to outline where that is on a through-cycle basis, Sinton represents $475 million to $525 million of that. As we mentioned, aluminum is $650 million to $700 million. And then generally on the value-added lines, we think about it more like maybe $50 million per line. So that would be like around $200 million. So the value-added lines last year for the whole year, we were operating each one differently, but around 60% of their capability, the 4 lines.

And then as far as Sinton, Sinton still had a lot of the additional costs to product quality embedded in 2025 that have since been resolved kind of in that fourth quarter, first part of this year time frame. So Sinton really has the capability now like all of our other facilities to operate wherever the market will drive it.

Barry Schneider
President & COO

Theresa, if I could add a little color to that. The 4 value-added lines, 2 galvanizing lines and 2 paint lines are actually operating very well. As you are aware, we had the core cases that we had filed a couple of years ago. Those core cases were against corrosion-resistant steels that were being dumped into this country, 10 different countries were at play. We won a substantial awards against those countries that will continue to limit the ability for those countries to just dump material into the United States.

And the new process lines really were pressured because of that dumped material. We had excess of 1 million tons that have already been removed from the market that have been coming from these 10 countries around the world. So as we've ramped through that, we've fine-tuned our quality, and we've made sure that the customer base is excited about the product they're receiving from those lines. They are operating full at this point in time. And because of our supply chain, being able to take bans, hot-rolled coil and convert them into galvanized and painted coils, it's really structurally helped respond quickly as markets change. Our supply chain was the innovation with painting, and it remains our strength and the quality and innovation of the product. So we're really excited about what those lines will do now for us that we aren't competing with the dumped tons from all across the world.

Our next question is coming from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan.

William Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I guess, I'd like to follow up on an earlier question on Sinton but broadened out a little bit. It sounds like the Sinton impact in the current quarter was fairly modest in terms of impact but I understand there may have been some other outages in your network in the late fourth quarter. Just trying to get a sense, is there -- can you help us quantify the impact on outages? And maybe more broadly, is there any planned maintenance in the first quarter that may impact your shipment profile?

Barry Schneider
President & COO

Bill, this is Barry. Our outages, we're really good in making a priority to take care of our equipment. And as you can imagine, our major flat-rolled mills are of different ages with Butler at 30, and Columbus around 20, and Sinton brand new. There's different things we do at all these plants. It's part of our long-term strategic plans to take care of our assets. Some cases, we add capabilities. Other cases, it's just good old-fashioned maintenance. It just coincided that all 3 of these -- the 3 big flat-rolled mills had outages in the fourth quarter. We don't -- we typically do 1 or 2 outages a year depending on what our projects have.

So quarter 1, we don't have anything on the table for us. We're looking more towards the second quarter right now for our planning. So we got a lot of good work done. A lot of that is, as I said, it's making sure that we continue to make state-of-the-art products for our customers and that the machines are running as well as possible. So outside of that, nothing structurally different from what we do.

Our next question is coming from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Philip Gibbs
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Mark, I understand you don't want to talk further about the BlueScope deal. It obviously appears very compelling. But curious if you're prohibited from buying back stock for any reason given there's now a potential deal that's been publicly disclosed.

Theresa Wagler
Executive VP, CFO & Company Secretary

There's nothing that is regulatory or structural in place, Phil. No.

Philip Gibbs
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then just a follow-up just on kind of the energy cost wildness we've seen. I know you don't use a lot of natural gas relative to electricity but perhaps there is a little bit of a knock-on effect on electricity as well. I know it's been ramping in some parts of the country, at least for consumers. So just curious in terms of how you're thinking about your energy cost basket heading into the early stages of the year here.

Barry Schneider
President & COO

Phil, this is Barry. I think with energy, we have very unique contracts everywhere. Even here in Indiana, we have 3 different electrical contracts. We try to be a good response in the market. So we buy smart. We take market signals for when we buy and sometimes we do take small downtime to help the system grids. With regard to electricity, we really haven't seen anything meaningful. There are times of the day. There are times of a week that it might get expensive. Many of our operations don't see that short term. Some do, and they plan for that.

With regard to natural gas, we typically don't -- we take positions future buys, and we make sure that what we're doing is responsible. When we see cold weather coming, we make sure we buy our transportation so that we can't be interrupted. And typically, as we get into the winter, where it's prudent, we'll make sure more of that product is prepaid or prebought. So we don't see huge swings with energy. We do see local impacts. But in general, we have good relationships with our providers.

And as you -- I'm sure you know, the mini mill process, we use considerably less natural gas per ton because in the flat rolled mills when we cast, it goes directly into a rolling mill shortly after it's cast. So that's the efficiency we get, which helps us with energy quite a bit.

Mark Millett
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

And Phil, just to add on there, just to sort of calibrate where our energy cost or percentage of energy cost is, it's running around about 10% of our production cost, both that's gas and electricity. So even some fluctuation isn't a material impact to us.

Our next question is coming from John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research.

John Tumazos
John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC

I'm unfamiliar with what are hot-rolled aluminum automotive products. I'm sort of asking an innocent question. I don't want to make it sound like I'm skeptical. I'm just unaware. What are finished applications on a car for hot-rolled aluminum? And is it possible that you're also selling hot-rolled aluminum to another aluminum roller whose cold rolling capacity is bigger than their hot-rolled capacity or for whom you have quality specs they can't make?

Mark Millett
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

The -- your question, as always, is on point, John, and I wouldn't say it's naive in any way, shape or form. There's not a real market for direct hot band aluminum going into an automobile. It does get converted. That conversion is being done by others today because we don't have the full downstream capability, and we don't have the CASH line. So others in the industry are converting that. And I think it's been part of the -- just a great sort of entrance into the whole aluminum market itself. Obviously, that market has been challenged on the supply side. And we have gone out and wherever we can, we're helping the industry generally, and part of that is supplying hot band to folks.

John Tumazos
John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC

When will you -- excuse me, Mark, when will you have all the capabilities to coat and cold rolled the automotive aluminum to sell the final product 100% on your own?

Mark Millett
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

The restriction is essentially the CASH line and the first CASH line is due to be operational at the end of the first quarter.

John Tumazos
John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC

And CASH stands for what? What is the acronym mean, excuse me?

Mark Millett
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

Continuous...

Barry Schneider
President & COO

Continuous anneal surface hardening. It's a final heat treatment so that it can be at the right strength when it goes to the mill.

John Tumazos

[Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Lawson Winder with Bank of America Securities.

Lawson Winder
BofA Securities, Research Division

When you look at the aluminum market today and the success you've had so far with the start-up, and you look out maybe a couple of years, do you see the potential for Steel Dynamics to add additional aluminum rolling capacity?

Mark Millett
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

There's absolutely no doubt that aluminum will be a growth platform for us going forward. And that's not to substitute or replace growth opportunities in steel or any of our other businesses. And just in general, we -- you got to compliment or I compliment our team. They do a phenomenal job ensuring that we've got a pipeline of really effective value-add opportunities. And so yes, we will continue to expand in steel. And obviously, aluminum is a new platform for us. And given the kind of the profile of that industry, there's a lot of -- and the supply-demand dislocation, there's certainly phenomenal opportunities there for us.

Lawson Winder
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. Fantastic. And if I could also just ask on your thoughts or prescriptions for the dividend this year, you would normally look to update your thinking on the dividend in March. At this point, do you see any other investment considerations that might constrain the extent to which the dividend could be increased this year, particularly when thinking about this very significant positive free cash flow inflection that's anticipated at Steel Dynamics in 2026?

Theresa Wagler
Executive VP, CFO & Company Secretary

So Lawson, the capital allocation strategy that we use for shareholder distributions are to keep the dividend growing as we have structural growth in cash flow. We have increased the dividend very significantly already for the advent of Sinton starting up, et cetera. So as we have further structural changes, we will increase the dividend appropriately. So aluminum could be part of that this year or maybe it's next year, but we'll let you know. In the absence of that, we definitely lean in with the variable share repurchase program.

Our next question is coming from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Philip Gibbs
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

You mentioned aluminum expected to be running at 90% by year-end '26. I think your previous view was 75%. What's given you the added confidence to, I guess, say that this morning and also meaning kind of what's changed?

Mark Millett
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

Well, I think given our experience in Sinton, we've been sort of retaining more of a conservative position, I would say. So that on top of what I see as a phenomenal team down in Columbus doing phenomenal things with an absolutely amazing piece of kit. The -- Barry, I think, has said it in past calls but just the nature of the aluminum process and production sort of steps or units, it's a lot more forgiving from a start-up standpoint. We've explained it in the past, a thin slab or steel mill such as a Sinton or a Butler or whatever, because the whole mill, melt through refining, through casting, through rolling is just one continuous thing, one hiccup in one spot can take you down. And it sort of compounds itself through the system. Whereas in aluminum, we have -- just at Columbus, we have the 4 melt cast units, got the hot mill, you've got -- we will have 3 cold-rolling units. It's just a lot more forgiving. So given all that, we just see.

Theresa Wagler
Executive VP, CFO & Company Secretary

It's the redundancy in it, in the system.

Mark Millett
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

Yes. That's right. And so we just have a high confidence level.

Philip Gibbs
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Just a follow-up to that. Can you give us an idea of where you're running at right now? I know there's a lot of trials and things going on, and you may not want to double count stuff that's not purely commercial but trying to just understand where you are from a capacity utilization standpoint.

Mark Millett
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

I would prefer not to be that specific. I would say that the -- our shipping rates are not necessarily a reflection of the production rates because of the quality, it just evolves. We're ramping up. That needs to be refined and optimized, and it's getting optimized almost on a weekly basis. But the actual physical capability of the equipment is very sound.

Operator

Our next question is coming from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley.

Carlos de Alba
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Hopefully, you can hear me. But just maybe, Theresa, can you comment a little bit on working capital? How do you expect that to move throughout the year given that you will continue to ramp up the alu business? And then CapEx beyond 2026, any comments there?

Theresa Wagler
Executive VP, CFO & Company Secretary

Yes. Thanks, Carlos. I think I got both questions. From a working capital perspective, a majority of the build that was required for aluminum, given the current pricing dynamics of aluminum, just the pure metal itself. Most of that has been captured already in 2025. There'll be some slight fluctuations between now and the end of the year. Nothing that I think would be material enough to be noted.

First quarter, however, just remember that we actually pay our profit sharing to all of our employees in that first quarter time frame. So generally, that has some pressure on the working capital and the cash flow. Otherwise, everything looks like it's pretty steady for the year.

As it relates to capital expenditures beyond 2026, as a reminder, our maintenance or what we refer to as our sustaining capital really is fairly low. It's generally around $250 million, maybe upwards of $300 million now. And beyond that, we haven't really named any specific material projects at this point in time.

Operator

Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks.

Mark Millett
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

Super, Ali. I appreciate that. And for those remaining on the call, again, thank you for your support and for your time today for sure. Our teams aspire to create that shareholder value creation that we seem to be able to do year in, year out and 2025 was a reflection of that. Most importantly, to our employees that might be on the line, you've all done an absolutely phenomenal job. You continue to do an absolutely phenomenal job. And what you do each and every day, that execution drives our success, and it drives that in the marketplace as well.

So thank you. And each and every one of you, be safe for yourselves, for each other and for your family. So thank you very much. Have a great day, everyone. Bye-bye.

Operator

Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation, and have a great and safe day.
