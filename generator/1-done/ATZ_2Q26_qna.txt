[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Irene Nattel with RBC Capital Markets.

Irene Nattel
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Great quarter. It certainly sounds as though there's very strong momentum in the business. Wondering whether as we look ahead to F '27, how confident you are in that high teens guide? What would be the factors that would cause you to either over or underdeliver relative to the soft guide that you include in the release?

Todd Ingledew
Chief Financial Officer

Irene, it's Todd. The high teens guide, we updated that for FY '27 just due to the fact that we've now had another incremental 130 basis points of pressure from the tariff changes for Vietnam and Cambodia as well as the de minimis removal for the rest of the world. So that will create obviously pressure next year. But we still expect to deliver high teens adjusted EBITDA margin, which does include 19%, but we thought it was prudent to give ourselves a bit more of a range on that. And we still have multiyear IMU opportunities. Obviously, the strength in the business is supporting operating leverage, diversification of our sourcing continues as well as negotiation with suppliers.

Our spend management initiatives are delivering benefits. So we still anticipate continuing to grow our margins next year despite all of the added pressure, and we do continue to have a multiyear runway for margin expansion.

Irene Nattel
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

That's really helpful. And so how would you -- just following up on that, are you satisfied with sort of the margin mix that you're delivering across different categories at this point in time?

Todd Ingledew
Chief Financial Officer

I mean we're extremely satisfied. We obviously delivered 600 basis points of EBITDA expansion, saw meaningful gross profit margin expansion, 360 basis points and also SG&A leverage. So we couldn't be more pleased with what we're seeing in the business. And obviously, if we didn't have any of this tariff and de minimis pressure, we'd be talking about our EBITDA margin forecast for this year being in the 18% to 19% range. So we're incredibly proud of the teams across all components of the business.

Our next question comes from Martin Landry with Stifel.

Martin Landry
Stifel Nicolaus Canada Inc., Research Division

Todd, I would like to touch on your cash balance. You guys are exceeding expectations, your own expectations for a couple of quarters now and your cash is building up. I think it's around $350 million for the quarter. Like what is at the level that you need to operate your business on a daily basis? And what is the level of extra cash that you currently have according to you?

Todd Ingledew
Chief Financial Officer

I think we're obviously above the level of what we need from a working capital perspective. Anywhere between $100 million and $200 million would be a comfortable position from a working capital perspective, depending on the time of year. But we have started repurchasing shares last quarter during the open trading window. We purchased 200,000 shares under the NCIB. And we actually also purchased 250,000 shares to use for the settlement of our RSUs that we're vesting this year.

So we have actually purchased back a meaningful amount of shares in the last several months. And we continue to target offsetting our option dilution for the year and at a minimum, buying back about 1 million shares.

Martin Landry
Stifel Nicolaus Canada Inc., Research Division

Okay. So your targets for 1 million shares of buyback this year? And then what could we expect that to accelerate next year? I mean, your CapEx should not expand a ton and your earnings will continue to expand. So I mean, is it fair to expect that your buyback could accelerate in fiscal '27?

Todd Ingledew
Chief Financial Officer

I mean, at this point, our plan is as -- has been communicated, which is to buyback to offset option exercising. We will, as we do every quarter, discuss our cash position with the Board. And at some point, we may increase the cadence. But at this point, we don't have plans currently to do that.

The next question comes from Mark Petrie with CIBC.

Mark Petrie
CIBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Obviously, the consumer is reacting incredibly favorably to the assortment. And I know it's broad-based strength, but helpful to hear anything specific that is working better than expected? Or were you sort of see opportunity to further lean in, and then I'm also hoping you can talk about the U.S. specifically and your momentum with regards to brand awareness and maybe that layer that into how you're approaching the marketing around the final New York City flagship opening next month or later this moment.

Jennifer Wong
CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes. Thanks, Mark. That's a great question. As usual, when our performance is great, everything is working really well. In particular, in Q2, we mentioned we saw our business accelerate in July and August. So there wasn't anything in particular to call out in terms of categories or styles, colors, fabrics, they're all of it was working.

One of the things that did happen in the quarter was our summer to Fall transition was particularly very well executed, I think our timing was impeccable. We did have some marketing around that, the product marketing around the earlier launch in July was very, very effective. And so that does lead to probably the second part of your question, which is our marketing is getting better. We're getting better at it, and we're seeing that it's really quite effective.

And certainly, last year, when we opened 3 flagships, always in a matter of recent each other right around Black Fiveday, and we marketed it, it was very, very effective. That was somewhat of an unprecedented moment.

That said, our Flatiron flagship will be opening around the same time, but the timing happens to incidentally work out for us. And given the success of what we saw last year, we do hope to have similar programming around the flagship in November. That said, it's 1 flagship -- it is also in Manhattan. The sale won't be necessarily the same as opening 3 flagships at once. But certainly, we do see that when we open a flagship and we amplify the news, it is quite effective.

Mark Petrie
CIBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Yes. Okay. That's helpful. And then just given the even further improvement in the store paybacks, I'm wondering what you're thinking for new stores next year? And also if there's sort of value or merit in kind of further tweaking the store experience, whether that's store sizes or like more cafes or other features?

Jennifer Wong
CEO & Non-Independent Director

Maybe I'll sort of frame it up, zooming out in terms of the bigger picture and then Todd could speak to some more of the details. But certainly, what we're seeing with our store openings right now and in particular, as it relates to the flagship, they are an amazing showcase of our everyday luxury experience. And so what we're seeing like with the flagships and in some of our bigger format stores, introducing the A-OK cafes has been really, really successful.

We just opened in Brickell in Florida, couple of weeks ago last week, and the A-OK cafe had lineups around the door, just like when I talked about the one here locally just outside of Vancouver. So those aspects of our retail experience really seem to be resonating very well with the customer. That, coupled with the in-store experience with the Italiers and just our style advisers in the store are some of our biggest differentiators when it comes to our retailing.

And as you know, over the years, we've increased the size of our stores. When we -- 10 years ago, we were talking about stores that were 6,000 square feet, then a few years after that, 8,000 square feet. And now we're talking about an average store size of 10,000 square feet. So we are seeing lots of momentum in our retailing and our retail experience and a lot of these aspects that we've introduced over the years is really, really catching on and really resonating with our customer.

Mark Petrie
CIBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Great. And then just to add on from a specific perspective, we do have a strong pipeline of boutique planned for next fiscal year with, again, a minimum of 12 new boutiques and 4 to 5 expansions and repositions with leases signed on a majority of those locations. So we have already -- and the specific locations for the others already identified and the negotiations underway. So yes, we're pleased with the cadence for next year, and it will be slightly more balanced to the first half, second half than weighted to the back half.

Next question comes from Stephen MacLeod with BMO Capital Markets.

Stephen MacLeod
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Firstly, yes, congrats on the very solid quarter. Great to see. So I had 2 questions. One is sort of high level and one is a bit more nitty-gritty, I suppose. But just on the high level, just sort of picking up with the commentary you were currently discussing around the U.S. stores. Can you talk a little bit about kind of how you're thinking about your total U.S. store growth potential over time, whether it's new locations, new markets or just total sort of store count?

Jennifer Wong
CEO & Non-Independent Director

Thanks, Stephen. Yes, we see still a ton of runway in the U.S. As we've mentioned, there's only 68 boutiques in the U.S. today. And long term, we see an opportunity that might be closer to 200 -- 180 to 200. Our focus is on attracting and acquiring new clients. We still see that there's a lot of runway there, a lot of white space. And our strategy is clearly proven and strong. And the great news is that we have a pipeline of stores that are identified, and we see that this is something that we can really capitalize on over the next few years.

Stephen MacLeod
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

That's great. And just along those lines, can you just remind us how many new markets you've entered or will be entering in fiscal '26?

Todd Ingledew
Chief Financial Officer

The new markets this year are total 5. It's Raleigh, Salt Lake City, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and then 2 stores in Scottsdale.

Stephen MacLeod
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. Great. And then just my more specific question was around -- just on the SG&A leverage. I mean, obviously, this strong top line is continuing into fiscal Q3, but you're not seeing -- not expecting SG&A leverage. Can you just talk a little bit about some of the strategic investments that you called out in your guidance commentary around SG&A?

Todd Ingledew
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, absolutely. So one is the distribution center here in Vancouver, where we have both capital and expenses related to that project. So there's incremental investment happening there compared to the prior year. And then we just have a number of projects underway that are across the business, whether that be RFID, merge planning software, ongoing investments in digital. We have workforce planning software development underway, really just improving on our world-class infrastructure. And just as it works out, the cadence between our project spend in Q3 and Q4 last year wasn't at the same level as the project spend for the back half of this year.

[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Dylan Carden with William Blair.

Dylan Carden
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Okay. It seems sort of a not insignificant piece of the acceleration over the last 3 quarters in part some of the incremental marketing and obviously, the awareness boost you're getting from the flagships. I'm just curious, you had a comment in there about sort of the meaningful increase in active customers and Todd in some of your last comments touched on sort of loyalty. Do you have a read or are you sort of confident with the profile of quality of some of these customers that are coming into the business quick?

And particularly as you have a view to lapping 20-plus percent comp on the back end of this, presumably, you keep marketing at a similar level, you gain efficiencies. But anything around kind of how you're thinking about how these customers roll forward would be helpful.

Jennifer Wong
CEO & Non-Independent Director

Thanks, Dylan. That's a very good question, and I do appreciate it. I just want to reframe something before I get into the marketing aspect because it does -- ultimately, our business is driven by product. And the reason why our business is so good is because we have what the customer wants and our product is resonating extremely well. So I just want to start off by saying the assortment is performing exceptionally well.

And then, of course, the marketing amplifies that. And yes, we have introduced more marketing in the last 1.5 years, and we are getting better at it. And certainly, it's driving -- we're looking at full funnel marketing. So it's driving brand awareness at the top of the funnel and then driving traffic and conversion at the bottom of the funnel is kind of classic.

And I guess what is really the headline here is that the new customer growth is a combination of both boutique openings and the marketing. And the great news is that this is a customer that's very consistent with our existing active client base, meaning that it is a high-quality customer, and we have enjoyed and benefited from a very loyal customer for decades now. And what we're seeing is a very similar customer. And in particular, what we love is when a young customer discovers Aritzia, falls in love with our brand and continues to grow with us for many years to come.

And certainly, we've been able to attract this customer, and we are seeing the new customer come back. So I think all of those points -- point to that it's all working, starting with having a great product that then we can tell people about and amplify through our store openings and marketing.

Dylan Carden
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Certainly. And there's a huge difference between acquiring a customer with product and with a discount. So I appreciate that. And the last one for me. I assume that we're going to hear a lot about sort of a warm fall in the United States come earnings season. And it sounds like between pulling forward your Fall launch and kind of the trends continuing into September, you're not seeing any of that. And I just was hoping you could sort of square that circle for us.

Jennifer Wong
CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes. Another great question. We have had some internal conversations about the weather. And certainly, with the 30 degree Celsius -- 30 degrees in the East in Toronto as of late, that does affect the product mix. But the great thing about us, as we've said in the past, too, is that we have such a broad assortment that you sell more sweaters instead of jackets when it's a little warmer. We did have some great transitional pieces. And so maybe some of the outerwear -- even though the outerwear is selling and a lot of folks are buying that early to get a jump on the season, we do have things that suit the weather.

And so I would say, over on the whole, we're not going to be citing weather. We're not citing weather at all right now in terms of the performance of our business. Clearly, you can see that we have many other things going on that allow us to perform the way that we are. So really, that's not a factor for us.

The next question comes from Joe Civello with Truist.

Joseph Civello
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Congrats on a great quarter. Just wondering if you could give a little bit more color on the IMU and smart spending opportunities. What inning are we on those? And where are the biggest opportunities you're looking at for on the efficiency side?

Todd Ingledew
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. From an IMU perspective, obviously, we have benefits from cost improvements with negotiations with suppliers sourcing, relocations as we grow and scale, we just have more and more negotiating power. So that's a key benefit that we're seeing on the IMU side, our seasonal pricing adjustments, there will obviously be another -- we have an ongoing tailwind from just the mix of our business as our business grows in the United States. There's IMU benefits there.

And then from a spend management perspective, for this year, we're really focused on process improvements and looking across the business as we do every year, but we have a really distinct focus on it this year as well as procurement. And just again, dialing in our negotiations across the business. Those are the key things that we're focused on in those 2 buckets for this year.

Joseph Civello
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then great to hear on the international website surpassing expectations. Just wanted to see if we could drill down a little more color and also how we're thinking about those markets eventually for a physical footprint. Thanks so much.

Jennifer Wong
CEO & Non-Independent Director

Thank you, Joe. Yes, I don't think I met you yet. Nice to hear from you. Certainly, the day we turned on our international e-commerce side, we immediately saw our dailies double effectively. So that was driven primarily by conversion. As we mentioned, we haven't even turned on any marketing, dedicated marketing yet. That is to come. We'll start that next month.

And so again, really encouraged by our efforts with that platform and its customer experience has significantly improved. Now I'll remind you that the e-commerce business before we had the new -- the international side was just a little over 1% of our e-com sales. So we're not talking about big dollars here. But certainly seeing that there is worldwide demand for Aritzia and everyday luxury in our products. And it's quite, again, expands it with 3 different continents in terms of where our top countries are.

So I think it's very encouraging. It's still obviously early days, but it's very encouraging because what this is helping us with is -- we continue to gather more data about how we could perform beyond the borders of Canada and the U.S. And I think it's a really good start for us to continue to monitor.

The next question comes from Michael Glen with Raymond James.

Michael Glen
Raymond James Ltd., Research Division

Maybe just first, Jennifer, can you maybe give some thoughts on the mobile app launch, what you would expect? Do you expect this to be a contributor to sales? Like how you think about increase in spending per customer? Anything along those lines that you think will happen with the mobile app launch?

Jennifer Wong
CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes. Thanks, Michael, for raising that. We're all very excited about the mobile app that's scheduled to launch at the end of this month. I've talked about it now for a few quarters about it being our digital flagship. So just like our boutique flagships have been a huge brand propelling marketing vehicle that, again, they showcase everyday luxury. They offer a great product assortment. The same thing goes for our mobile app. It will certainly drive brand awareness. I believe it will be a best-in-class experience. It completely embodies the everyday luxury ethos.

And I see this being a vehicle for driving frequency among our existing base of clients as well as growing base of clients. And so we do envision a meaningful amount of our digital business running through the mobile app. Obviously, it hasn't launched yet, so we can't really talk too much about what that is other than we know that our peers do have anywhere between 20% to 40% of their business running through their app, and we always pride ourselves on being best-in-class.

So right now, when we launch it, it's going to be about the downloads. It will be about monitoring the downloads. That will be a great early indicator as far as the potential for the app. And it become -- it's an iterative kind of process in terms of making sure that we keep up with interesting releases and engaging releases. And so we'll be able to report more once it's launched. But right now, very excited for the launch and monitoring the downloads.

Michael Glen
Raymond James Ltd., Research Division

Okay. And just on the store fleet, I know we talk about store openings a lot, but what's the opportunity for renovations and relocations within the store fleet right now? And are you able to give any indications what those -- what that type of activity, like how much it contributes to top line, what some of the paybacks are on those type of investments, how they impact square footage? Anything you can add there?

Todd Ingledew
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I mean, Michael, it's highly dependent, obviously, on the type of relocation you're talking about. Last year, when we relocated our SoHo and Fifth Avenue stores, we had meaningful expansions of square footage. And this year, we have the Flatiron store. But our typical expansion would be moving from, say, 5,000 to 7,000 square feet to maybe 10,000 to even 15,000 square feet, and it's very dependent. So it doesn't -- I don't -- I wouldn't say there's one tried tested rule on that. We do have a pipeline of what we feel is about 4 to 5 expansions or repositions a year.

And that evolves. As Jennifer mentioned, our store size has been growing larger and larger. Our average new store is now 10,000 square feet. So obviously, as we grow the optimal size of our stores, that creates more opportunity for expansions and repositions.

From a payback perspective, we typically target 18 to 24 months of payback for those stores. It's a little higher than the new store paybacks of typically under 12 months, but that's because we're only using obviously the incremental revenue and contribution against the capital expenditures for the store. But we continue to be extremely pleased with how they're performing, and they're a meaningful component of our real estate expansion strategy.

The next question comes from Brian Morrison with TD Cowen.

Brian Morrison
TD Cowen, Research Division

First question for Todd, please. The strategic initiatives that you announced that are going away a little bit on the margins in the back half of the year. Were any of those incremental to your prior guide for fiscal 2026. I'm talking about the RFID, the merged software, or were those also included in your previous guidance?

Todd Ingledew
Chief Financial Officer

No. Those have all been contemplated, the ones that I listed.

Brian Morrison
TD Cowen, Research Division

Okay. So nothing incremental then?

Todd Ingledew
Chief Financial Officer

Not from those, no. We have -- we do have -- and we have incremental projects, but they're not ones that I just listed.

Brian Morrison
TD Cowen, Research Division

Okay. I guess the second question is for Jen. You have many top line category drivers, including the mobile app that you just talked about. And clearly, your product is resonating very well. But absent in terms of your revenue drivers or potential offsets to the tariff pressures, anything about price increases? I'm just wondering how you think about that lever.

Jennifer Wong
CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes. We -- again, a fair question. We are thinking about pricing the same way we always think about pricing, which is our pricing strategy is to uphold everyday luxury. It is not based on tariffs. So we will continue to do what we've always done, which is we do evaluate our pricing every season. It's on a seasonal basis. It's very important that our priorities to stage that everyday luxury value proposition.

That said, any pricing actions we take is more part of a broader IMU improvement initiatives that Todd referenced, I think I've referenced it as well, that's a multiyear initiative that involves cost savings negotiations as well as pricing actions.

Operator

The next question comes from Mauricio Serna with UBS.

Mauricio Serna Vega
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

First on Canada, could you talk a little bit more about what kind of customer like describe a little bit more about the new customer that you're having there because it's pretty impressive considering that the brand has been there for over 40 years. So more curious to hear about the type of customer that you are tracking? And then maybe could you just talk about like for fourth quarter, what is the implied comp range that you are contemplating in your current time?

Jennifer Wong
CEO & Non-Independent Director

Thanks, Mauricio. I'll take the first part, and then maybe I'll let Todd take the second part. Regarding the new customer in Canada, or -- I guess I'll start off by saying we're -- we continue to attract the same sort of profile of customer. Remember that we have a very, very broad appeal across 3 generations effectively. Gen Zs, Millennials, Gen Xers. And so the majority of our customers do tend to be in the Gen Z, millennial category.

So as I alluded to earlier in the call, when a younger customer discovers Aritzia and falls in love with our brand and they become a very, very little customer and continue to grow with us. So in spite of being in Canada now for over 40 years, we continue to attract a customer that's between the ages of the core of 15 to 45 and even younger and even older. So the fact that, that customer still remains and loves high quality, beautiful products and attainable price point and really enjoys the boutique experience as well as our online experience. It's again, very encouraging for us to know that our brand still resonates with our new customer, even in Canada. And so we are seeing, in fact, double-digit growth in our customer in Canada.

Todd Ingledew
Chief Financial Officer

Great. And the second part of the question was about our comp for Q4. Is that correct, Mauricio?

Mauricio Serna Vega
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Yes. Just like the implied range of that comp.

Todd Ingledew
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So we've updated our guidance to $3.3 billion to $3.35 billion for the fiscal year, which is growth of 21% to 22%. Maybe I'll just talk about Q3 first and then give you some color on Q4. As we've discussed, quarter-to-date trends in Q3 are consistent with what we saw in Q2 with total growth outpacing or pacing 30%. So we're just above 30%.

But we're only 5 weeks into the quarter and our highest volume period of the quarter is still ahead. We'll be lapping exceptionally strong growth from last November. So therefore, in Q3, our guidance range assumes a total comp growth in the mid-teens, delivering that total growth of 20% to 24% that we've guided to.

And then for the fourth quarter, we're lapping extremely robust growth with comp of 26% last year. There's actually some FX headwinds with our forecasted rate at $1.38 on compared to $1.43 last year. And there's also some conservatism. But our Q4 guidance assumes mid-single-digit comp growth and high single-digit total growth for Q4. But I mean, I think it's important to remember that we do have a great momentum in our business. And I don't know if you want to go into some of the things.

Jennifer Wong
CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes. Let me just remind everybody that we're definitely set up to succeed with all the elements in place to deliver in the back half of the year. We talk about it a lot, but let me just run through it all. It starts with product. Having the right product in the right place at the right time. Our product assortment is outstanding right now. I love seeing it in the stores. It's absolutely merchandises and present well. We're hearing anecdotally as well as obviously, to our sales results that it's resonating well. We are in an excellent inventory position between what's on hand, on order, in transit. We are in an excellent inventory position.

We have 9 boutiques opening in the back half of the year, 6 of which are in Q3 alone. That includes the flagship in Flatiron. As we said before, our new boutiques are the most predictable driver of top line growth. We're well on track with all of our digital initiatives. We're delivering those on time. The mobile app is scheduled in a few weeks. We do have these exciting collaborations that continue to drive interest and engagement and traffic to aritzia.com, and in our boutiques and top it off with some strategic investments in marketing, and we are getting better in our marketing and more effective.

We are seeing a return of creating demand and driving traffic and looking forward to some of our best campaigns ever during the holiday time. And so all of these things across the business, we have already executed very well on in the last couple of quarters and continue to go into the next couple of quarters in a very, very, very strong position.

And I suppose -- what I would add at the end is last but not least, our teams, our teams are phenomenal. Our teams are highly motivated right now and highly poised to execute with excellence.

The last question comes from Chris Li with Desjardins.

Christopher Li
Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division

Thanks for all the great discussion so far. I wanted to just maybe ask about your EBITDA margin guidance for the year. I guess first, at a very high level, what needs to happen for you to achieve the higher end of your guidance? And then maybe vice versa, what should happen to get you to the lower end of your guidance for the year?

Todd Ingledew
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I mean I would just simply put that to the revenue and leverage at the top end of the range from higher revenue and the bottom being more reflective of the lower part of our range from a revenue perspective. We obviously have all of our mitigation strategies in place to -- that are what's helping us offset, the increased tariff pressure and why we've been able to keep the adjusted EBITDA range for the year, unchanged at $15.5 million to $16.5 million. But it's predominantly the revenue range that would push us both up and down.

Christopher Li
Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just a follow-up. If I do the math correctly, just based on your guidance, it would imply Q4 EBITDA margin might be down kind of in that 100 to 150 basis points depending on your assumption. Am I -- is that directionally correct? That's what you're saying?

Todd Ingledew
Chief Financial Officer

We're expecting flat both gross profit and SG&A in Q4 also. It's really the -- unfortunately, the other income, I hate to bring that up, but it is -- it's the other income that we benefited meaningfully in Q4 last year because of the exchange rate strength in Q4 last year. We can take that offline, but that's really what's driving the change in the fourth quarter.

This concludes the question-and-answer session and today's conference call. Thank you for joining, and have a pleasant day. You may now disconnect your lines.
