[Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Bret Jordan from Jefferies.

Bret Jordan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Could you talk about the maturation schedule of the new stores now that it's become a very, I guess, a more significant item as far as the ramp and then incremental investment that's required, I think you're talking about a couple of DCs internationally. But as far as domestic store growth, are there more DCs or accelerated hub expansion as you build this new store base? I mean just sort of trying to think about an SG&A expense at the front, but when do we start getting the return?

Jamere Jackson
Chief Financial Officer of Customer Satisfaction

Yes. Thanks for your question, Bret. So typically, our new stores mature on about a 4- to 5-year time frame, if you will. And we've seen this historically over time, and it's fairly predictable. Our teams do a great job of getting those assets into the market and then building our business around them. Regarding SG&A, we had about 2 points of the growth in our SG&A that was related to new stores and the acceleration of our commercial programs. And you'll see this ramp continue as we peak at the 500 stores globally that we're expecting in FY '28. What has us excited is in addition to the new satellite stores that we're building, we're also building out our Mega-Hub footprint, which, as we mentioned, is going to grow to 300 Mega-Hubs.

We've got about 100 of those in the pipeline today, and we feel very good about our execution there. So as we look at the way our operating margins will progress between now and then, you'll see this roughly 2 points of incremental SG&A associated with this ramp, if you will. And then you'll see that sort of lap off and we'll return to the kind of operating margins that we have in the past. As it relates to investments, obviously, we've been investing in distribution centers. We had a couple of new distribution centers that we put in over the last couple of years or so. Those have come online, and we're getting the productivity out of them. We're also investing in distribution centers in Mexico and Brazil, and all of this will underpin the growth. So that 2 points of SG&A that I talked about includes all the investments that we need to make across the business.

Philip Daniele
CEO, President & Director

Maybe I'll add a little bit to that. We've talked a lot about this project we've had in place for several years now, which is Supply Chain 2030, which is really looking at what did our supply chain need to look like to get us to these faster-growing store numbers. Most of those investments in the U.S. have already been in place and stood up those 2 new DCs we opened up last year. There's also some new efficiency strategies built in those distribution centers as well as some direct import facilities.

In Mexico, as we've talked about, we opened up a new DC and expanded one, and we're in the process of expanding our Monterrey distribution center to almost double the size, and that will be open fully operational probably in March. And then we're bringing our distribution from third party to our own supply chain down in Brazil, which should help us for quite some time. So most of the U.S. expansion is done. It will be about improving efficiencies. Mexico will be done effectively in March or April. And that will take us for quite some time for the next couple of years from a supply chain perspective.

Bret Jordan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. A quick question on the commercial growth on a 2-, 3-year basis. Could you sort of parse out what might be national account versus domestic? I mean, obviously, not a lot of new national accounts entering the market. Is this skewed more to up and down the street business?

Philip Daniele
CEO, President & Director

Yes. We're growing on the commercial side of the business in all of the different segments that we break out. Obviously, to your point, there's not a lot of new national accounts that you would consider branded national accounts, but we're growing share of wallet in all of those segments, national accounts, what we call up and down the street customers, which are generally the local mom-and-pop shop as well as what we call verticals and associations. We're growing across all of the 4 segments. Pretty helpful.

Your next question is coming from Chris Horvers from JPMorgan.

Barath Rao
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

It's Bharat Rao, on for Chris. So on DIY, given the sequential slowdown, I know you said weather was a headwind in the middle 4 weeks. But can you help us parse out how much of that was additionally attributable to any government shutdown noise or any like sort of observable deterioration in the underlying trend or demand?

Philip Daniele
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I wouldn't say that the demand has necessarily deteriorated. As we mentioned, kind of that weather segment in the middle of the -- we broke the quarter down into the 12-week quarter down into 4-week segments. The middle section of that segment, year-over-year, you had some changes in weather in more of the northern markets, and you had the impact from the hurricane that benefited us last year that did not reoccur this year. So it was really a wobble in the middle 4-week segment, not related to the customer per se, more related to the impact from last year, both positive weather event due to hurricanes and a cold snap that happened last year as opposed to something that really deteriorated in this year. And that middle 4-week segment, as we mentioned, was down significantly compared to the first 4-week segment and the third 4-week segment. I hope that's a little clearer.

Barath Rao
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then a quick one on SG&A. So previously, you talked about mid-single-digit SG&A store growth for the year and came in at the higher end in 1Q despite softer sales. So now that you're accelerating store growth and you said 2Q SG&A will be similarly up to 1Q. Can you help us understand like how does the curve of that SG&A per store growth look throughout the year? And does that pretty much moderate into next year?

Jamere Jackson
Chief Financial Officer of Customer Satisfaction

Yes. As I mentioned, we had about 2 points of growth that was related to new stores and really the opening of new programs in our commercial area of the business domestically, and we expect that to continue. And then if you look at our store opening ramp, we're going to continue to open new stores. It's going to be back half weighted. As I mentioned, we'll open 350 to 360 stores globally in total and a good chunk of that will be weighted in the back half. So you'll see some acceleration as we move through. And again, this is all predicated on the growth that we're seeing. We're continuing to invest in a disciplined way in those growth initiatives. And quite frankly, we like the earnings and the cash story that this is going to generate for us as we come out of this.

Your next question is coming from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.

Skylar Tennant
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

This is Skylar Tennant on behalf of Simeon. On our first question, we wanted to ask whether the consumer is showing any signs of elasticity to higher prices or whether you're seeing any signs of trade down?

Philip Daniele
CEO, President & Director

Yes. We kind of figured this question was probably coming. At the end of the day, I would kind of characterize it as the lower-end consumer has been under pressure for, frankly, quite some time, I'd say, more than 2 years. And what I would say is they've been relatively stable. So there hasn't been a significant wobble in that lower-end consumer. The higher-end consumer, we think, is still doing okay.

And we think that's been relatively stable over the last couple of quarters. We don't have a lot of categories where you would see trade down. We have some good, better, best opportunities in batteries and brakes and wiper blades, things of that nature. But the vast majority of our inventory is generally one part that fits a particular vehicle, and there's not a whole lot of upsell opportunities based on good, better, best opportunities. So we don't see a lot of trade down. There's a little bit, but it's really not been that meaningful.

Skylar Tennant
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And as a follow-up, how are you thinking about inflation? Has it impacted the entire product catalog? And for items not impacted, are you seeing any signs of demand elasticity there?

Philip Daniele
CEO, President & Director

Yes. The inflation, we think the inflation is going to continue to increase through what would be our third quarter on a year-over-year basis. And then some of the impacts from tariff and cost increases started in Q4 of last year. So we'll start to lap some of that. I suspect that there'll still be some increases, but they'll probably be a little bit less muted in the latter part of what would be our Q4, more like the summertime. But as far as separating out what has tariff impact and have not had tariff impact, most of the product that we sell is essentially break fix or it's required maintenance, and there hasn't been a lot of volatility in those product categories in purely discretionary categories, which is a relatively small part of our business, more like 16% to 17% of our total market. Those categories were impacted over the last 2 years and had some pretty significant downfalls. But over the last year or so, they've actually been relatively stable and seen some minor improvement in sales over the last year.

Your next question is coming from Michael Lasser from UBS.

Unknown Analyst

This is [indiscernible] for Michael Lasser. The first question is on the comps. We were wondering how likely is it that the same-store sales momentum would be sustainable domestically as comparisons become more challenging in the third quarter as well as fourth quarter and you lap a greater inflation number in 4Q?

Philip Daniele
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I would characterize that we think those numbers are going to be relatively stable. Again, our comp in the latter part of Q3 and Q4, there was an increase from -- if you think about a 2-year stack, and it might moderate a little bit. But we're confident behind our initiatives that we have in place that we will continue to grow market share on both the DIY and the commercial business. So they may flatten out a little bit. But at the end of the day, I think we're going to continue on this growth trajectory for both DIY and on the commercial side of the business.

Unknown Analyst

Got you. That's helpful. And as far as my second question goes, I'm going to try to approach the SG&A topic a little differently. Since the beginning of fiscal year 2024, SG&A growth has outpaced sales growth in each quarter and by about 2 to 3 percentage points on average. So how should we expect that gap between sales and SG&A growth to unfold going forward, especially as you accelerate unit growth? And as part of that, would it be fair to think the model is more reliant on recouping some of the gross margin headwinds you faced in the past couple of years to return to operating margins of 19% plus?

Jamere Jackson
Chief Financial Officer of Customer Satisfaction

Yes. So the first thing that I'll say, and we've reiterated this point is that we're growing SG&A in a disciplined way as we create a faster-growing business. And so what you've seen is that the investments in SG&A have been purposeful. We've had accelerated growth in SG&A related to new stores and the acceleration of our commercial business. And 2 things. Number one, you're starting to see the growth shoots associated with that. And we like the earnings profile of the new stores, first of all, as they're coming out of the shoots, but more importantly, when those stores mature in the next 4 to 5 years.

What I'll say about the gap between sales growth and SG&A growth over time is that SG&A will slightly outpace the sales growth as we move through. But as we get to the point where these stores mature, then we'll manage SG&A growth in line with sales. But I think the key takeaway is that it's been purposeful, and this is underpinning the growth that we've talked about, and we like the earnings and cash profile on the back side of this.

Unknown Analyst

Got you. And the model is reliance on gross margin to get back to 19% margin profile?

Jamere Jackson
Chief Financial Officer of Customer Satisfaction

Well, I think the reality is if you look at the model today and you're talking about operating profits, if you will, you got 2 points associated with this accelerated growth that we're talking about. You got about 140 basis points associated with LIFO. So between those 2, you add back, call it, 3.5 points to a business that's going to do 17 and some change on a GAAP basis, and you're back at your 20% operating model. And if you do that on top of a much larger store base, again, that's what has us excited about the model as we move forward.

Operator

Your next question is coming from Scott Ciccarelli from Truist.

Unknown Analyst

This is [indiscernible] on for Scott. LIFO charges were less than expected this quarter, and now you've lowered your expectation of the headwind for the next 3 quarters by around 25%. Just want to know if this is from just greater tariff reductions or maybe more focused mitigation efforts? And then like could that taper like the upper end of your same SKU expectations like for inflation throughout the year?

Jamere Jackson
Chief Financial Officer of Customer Satisfaction

Yes. So 2 things on LIFO. Number one, we have not seen as much cost impact as we had originally anticipated. I think we've talked very openly about the fact that we're running a tried and true playbook. One is to the extent that there's an opportunity to negotiate lower cost with vendors and protect the customer, we've been doing that. If there's an opportunity for us to diversify sources and maintain the sales we're doing that. And then the third leg of the stool, obviously, has been to raise retails.

So we haven't -- in running that playbook, we haven't seen as much inflation as we would have anticipated. I think the second dynamic is you saw the announcements where the IEEPA tariffs on China moved from 20% down to 10%. And so that does lower our expectation going forward. But what we're seeing, and you heard Phil talk about this a little bit earlier, is we're still expecting to see higher costs associated with tariffs as we move through. And that is going to have some impact on ticket average and to have some impact on comps going forward. It's just that what we had anticipated originally, we're seeing better performance from a cost standpoint and lower IEEPA tariffs from the rollback that was announced in November.

Philip Daniele
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I would continue to add that our merchants have been working at this tariff mitigation, country of origin diversification and multiple supplier diversification, frankly, since the original tariffs went in back in 2016 and '17, and they've become pretty good at it. Having multiple sources for country of origin as well as multiple suppliers to supply a particular category has been a strategy we've had for quite some time.

We've had a strategy for diversifying our sourcing out of China into other countries for years, and they've become very adept at it. To Jamere's point, we're running the same playbook and our folks have gotten pretty good at doing that as well as continuing to improve our supply chain efficiencies, which are helping our gross margins. But they've just done an exceptional job, which you saw in our gross margin, overcoming the vast majority of the mix shift to a lower-margin business that grew faster on the commercial side of the business. So we think that's a really good story for us.

Your next question is coming from Stephen Zaccone from Citi.

Ariana Warden
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

This is Ariana, on for Steve. My first question is, can you give any color on the merch margin performance in the quarter? And like any color on the outlook for this fiscal year?

Jamere Jackson
Chief Financial Officer of Customer Satisfaction

Yes. We had a very strong quarter from a merch margin standpoint. And what you see in our underlying gross margins is we were up 9 basis points, excluding LIFO. We had about a 34 basis points drag just from the mix shift associated with a faster-growing commercial business. So all of the merchant actions that we're taking inside the company are working really hard to offset that drag from -- the drag that's associated with the commercial rate. So -- and that's a playbook that we're continuing to run with intensity, and the teams are doing a pretty good job there.

Ariana Warden
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

And then my follow-up kind of piggy back off the previous question. So like where do you kind of expect SKU to peak in 3Q as it accelerate sequentially?

Jamere Jackson
Chief Financial Officer of Customer Satisfaction

Yes. I mean I won't be date certain about when it will peak, but what we can tell you is that we're going to continue to see inflation coming through our cost of goods sold. We're seeing it both in terms of what we're seeing from vendors, but also from tariffs. And as that rolls through, it is potential to see another point or 2 over the next couple of quarters impacted on same SKU and resulting in higher average tickets.

Operator

Your next question is coming from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs.

Mark Jordan
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

This is Mark Jordan on for Kate McShane. The first question, I think, might be a quick one, but it's just what drove the difference between same SKU inflation in the retail business and the commercial business? Is that just the mix of the parts that are being sold?

Philip Daniele
CEO, President & Director

Yes. It's a mix and combination of products and parts that get sold between the 2. The commercial side, generally, you have a higher hard part mix and you have generally newer less -- let me say this the right way, newer SKUs in their life cycle, which generally are a little more expensive because they have more technology associated with them essentially.

Mark Jordan
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Perfect. And then in terms of product categories, just wondering if there's anything to read through there in terms of the health of your core customer. Which categories were stronger and which were weaker during the quarter? And are you still seeing improvement on the discretionary side?

Philip Daniele
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I would say, I mean, our failure categories and our maintenance categories continue to be the best performers, which I think is indicative of the health of the automotive industry in total. Our weaker performers have been over the last couple of years, frankly, the more purely discretionary items. Over the last year or so, those items have kind of flattened out from a negative comp perspective and continue to -- and started to slightly grow year-over-year, which we think is a pretty good sign that, that segment of product has kind of bottomed out and will probably continue to grow from this point forward.

Mark Jordan
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

And just thinking about the comp there, is that mostly being same SKU inflation driven on that side? Or is units up as well?

Philip Daniele
CEO, President & Director

On the purely discretionary product, it's a little bit of both.

Operator

Your next question is coming from Michael Montani from Evercore.

Michael Montani
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

It's Mike Montani on for Greg Melich. I just wanted to ask a little bit about the underlying performance in merch margin, if I could. So that was strong in the quarter, Jamere, and wondering how to think about that into next quarter? And then also if you look at private label supply chain optimization, price optimization, like can you help us just understand a little bit more the drivers that are offsetting that 30 to 40 bps mix headwind that you referenced?

Jamere Jackson
Chief Financial Officer of Customer Satisfaction

Yes. I mean we continue to run the merch margin playbook, as I've historically said, with intensity. Our teams are doing a fantastic job looking for alternate sources, looking for new brands to introduce and quite frankly, when there are opportunities to move more to our house brands to help us drive margin opportunities. And that's a playbook that we've run over time and the teams continue to execute very well on that. We're going to continue to have a fairly significant headwind from a faster-growing commercial business, and we're really pushing hard on merch margins to mute that or offset that completely. And that's what we'll do as we move forward.

Operator

Your next question is coming from Robby Ohmes from Bank of America.

Yanjun Liu
BofA Securities, Research Division

This is Vicky Liu, on for Robby Ohmes. Can you talk about your expectation for early calendar 2026 as we'll likely have the combined impact of a hot summer, cold winter and maybe some tax refund tailwind from the One Big Beautiful Bill?

Philip Daniele
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Great question. If you think cyclically about how our business performs in Q2 and what that means for Q3 and Q4, Q2 is always our most volatile quarter due to primarily these big weather events that move across the country. What we would like to see, and it looks like we might get this year is we like to see cold weather followed by precipitation in the form of snow and ice. Those have a tendency to put a lot of strain on the undercar parts of the vehicle. So think suspension, brakes, chassis parts, things of that nature and cold weather puts a lot of pressure on batteries, which are a pretty big part of our business. So what we'd like to see is a nice cold weather winter, and that will help sales coming into the summer and spring and summer times, which is kind of what we saw this last year.

If you remember the comment that we made, our northern stores performed a little bit better than our southern stores. Some of that was due to some weather comparisons, but it's also the knock-on effect of a better winter last year that carries on through the spring and the summertime, which is what we saw in those categories. So that's kind of what we think will happen. It's hard to predict the weather. I don't think Jamere and I are very good at that. But it looks like the beginning, it's going to be cold next couple of weeks, colder than last year. That's generally good for us. And they're saying it looks like in the later part of the winter, we're going to get more snowfall in the Northwest and the Midwest than we did -- or Northeast and the Midwest than we did last year. So those should set up pretty good for us. Also, in the summer.

Jamere Jackson
Chief Financial Officer of Customer Satisfaction

Yes. I mean the one thing that we always talk about is remember that because of all the weather cycles, I mean, Q2 -- our Q2 in the early part of the year can be pretty volatile. And we always say that we're a couple of storms away from greatness or a couple of storms away from it being not as good as we anticipated. So there's typically some volatility in the quarter. We're focused on execution though.

Philip Daniele
CEO, President & Director

I agree with that. To answer your question on taxes, I don't think we really know the answer to that and how that's going to lay. I will say that generally, our Q2 ends right about the time of tax refunds. So there can be some volatility on whether that ends up in -- how much of it ends up in the end of our Q2 and the beginning of our Q3. So there can be some volatility around that time frame.

Operator

And our last question is coming from Justin Kleber from Baird.

Justin Kleber
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I wanted to ask the SG&A question just one more time. I apologize. I understand the impact from store growth and how that builds from here, but just wanted to clarify that growth on a per store basis, are you telling us we should expect that 5.9% pace in 1Q to effectively continue? Or are there certain offsetting levers to bend that growth curve on a per store basis as you start to annualize some of these investments to improve service and delivery speed?

Jamere Jackson
Chief Financial Officer of Customer Satisfaction

Yes. I mean you're going to be somewhere in that same ZIP code on a per store basis. And the other point that I'll make is, remember, in the back half of the year, we're going to continue to accelerate the store growth. So if you're in that ZIP code, you're in the right area. There are always things that we're working on from an SG&A standpoint. But if you're modeling going forward and you're in that ZIP code, you're in the right place.

Justin Kleber
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And then if I could just follow up on the international outlook. You mentioned softer trends in Mexico, but the 2-year stack did improve sequentially. So was that just driven by Brazil? And then would you expect that 2-year stack to remain relatively stable internationally, just as we think out over the next few quarters?

Philip Daniele
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I think you'll see it be fairly consistent, we believe, over the next couple of quarters. And just speaking of our international business as a whole, we really like the accelerated growth we have there. We think we have opportunities to gain market share in all of our international markets, both with a growing DIY business as well as a rapidly growing commercial business. And as those consumers get a little healthier, as the economics continue to hopefully improve, we expect our sales to accelerate in those markets as well. So the international markets are fantastic for us.

Okay. Before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate that we believe our industry remains in a strong position, and our business model is very solid. We are excited about our growth prospects for the new year, but we will take nothing for granted as we understand that our customers have alternatives. We have exciting plans that will help us succeed in the future, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we remain focused on delivering flawless execution and striving to optimize shareholder value for the future, we are confident that AutoZone will be successful. Finally, we'd like to wish everyone a happy and healthy holiday season, and thank you for participating on today's call.
