Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Nichols with B. Riley.

Josh Nichols
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

Great to see the company hitting another record EBITDA margin during the quarter here. It looks like there's a healthy step-up in profitability in fiscal 4Q as well with the FluentStream acquisition closing. Is that because is there a significantly higher subscription and services gross margin components? Or I'm just kind of curious like below the revenue line, what gets you to that big jump up in EPS and EBITDA for fiscal 4Q?

Shigeyuki Hamamatsu
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So I can point to a few things there, Josh. Thanks for the question. And first of all, the -- certainly, we're seeing more operating leverage, and we made some -- we took some actions in late Q3 on R&D side of spend and that -- we're going to see a full quarter impact of that in Q4. So that's number one. And we continue to manage sales and marketing spend as well. I think we started the year with 28% and we continue to monitor the customer acquisition costs, both organically but also inorganically to balance things out, optimize them.

And lastly, I think the tariff impact that we were estimating going into the second half, we didn't see that in Q3. And as of today, we're not seeing that in Q4. So I guess that's good news for us, obviously. And I think all of those things combined, we're seeing a better -- more flow through to the bottom line for Q4.

Josh Nichols
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

Appreciate the context. And then I know obviously, FluentStream is closed, but you're still waiting on Phone.com, which is in the guidance, obviously, for the fourth quarter. Eric, you mentioned that there's -- like those numbers that you kind of laid out in terms of full year run rate numbers for those two acquisitions don't include any synergies. Is there any way for you to maybe kind of quantify any expectations that you may be able to see around those? Or is this something that you think you may start to see some synergy benefits in like the second half of next fiscal year or a little bit longer?

Eric Stang
President, CEO & Chairman

Josh, so with FluentStream, we expect the synergy benefits, at least on the cost side, to be relatively modest. There are some benefits on the revenue side with AirDial and also just being able to bring some of our developments over onto their platform.

With Phone.com, we're going to have to see once we get it closed, but we do think there's more overlap in what we're doing and what they're doing, and we can work together to drive both scale economies and also just rationalize the things we're doing so that we share the work over a larger base. It's hard to say, but I'm sure we'll see some early wins out of the gate, particularly with vendor relationships, and then we'll assess from there.

Our next question comes from the line of Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street Capital Markets.

Eric Martinuzzi
Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division

Yes. I wanted to understand on the legacy business, given the Q4 guide was a little bit below where we were expecting. Shig, I think you mentioned that there were some AirDial pushouts. I've got -- basically, between what I was looking for and what you guys guided to on the legacy business, I'm off by about $1.5 million. Is that all attributable to AirDial pushouts?

Shigeyuki Hamamatsu
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Most of that pretty much are AirDial pushouts. The -- earlier in the quarter -- I would say, during the Q3, and obviously, so far Q4, customer engagement continues to be strong, I would say. And by the way, the AirDial bookings actually in Q3 grew 50% year-over-year. But in terms of customer deployment timing and also the new order timing that we were expecting originally to be much earlier, so both installation and order timing being pushed out to next year, which is also disappointing, but it's all on the customer side. We are obviously ready to deliver and install.

And some of those customers were -- have been engaged with us for some time, doing proof-of-concept installations. But for one reason or another, they decided to install next year versus this year. So most of that difference you talked about in guidance, prior versus now, is related to that.

Eric Martinuzzi
Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And is this something -- I know you've been at this for a couple of years now with the AirDial. Is this a different behavior than 12 months ago? Just kind of a one-off? Or do you think there's something -- a read-through on the macro?

Shigeyuki Hamamatsu
Senior VP & CFO

Well, I would say this, again, I don't know if it's necessarily new, but also it's a reflection of -- in a good way, I guess, one can say, it's a reflection of the fact that we are now engaged with larger -- more larger opportunities and larger opportunity means that sometimes it takes time to get through the proof-of-concept installation and get into orders and actually get into the installation. And so part of it is the growth we see in the type of larger accounts that we engage with today with AirDial opportunity. So I don't know if, Eric, you would add anything to add, but...

Eric Stang
President, CEO & Chairman

No, I think that says it well. I mean, I suppose we've known this in the past, but it's -- we're seeing customers say, "You know what, the holidays' coming, we'll just start in January and -- with rollout." And that's a little bit of what all this is about, too.

Eric Martinuzzi
Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division

Got you. And Eric, the -- post close, I realize we've only technically owned FluentStream for a week now. But what are your intentions or what kind of out-of-the-gate actions are you taking as far as embracing that FluentStream customer base?

Eric Stang
President, CEO & Chairman

We've said on our previous calls, we think FluentStream is a very well-managed business. And the CEO of FluentStream, Kerrin Parker, some we've known for a long time, have great respect for her and we're thrilled she's now a part of Ooma. They are driving approximately $10 million of EBITDA on their approximate $23 million or $24 million of revenue. That's pretty good performance. We do think there's opportunities on the vendor relationship side. There's opportunities to leverage their channels with AirDial because they are almost 100% go-to-market through channel relationships. They are -- on the R&D side, they're doing some investment in areas that we're also investing in. And so we can get together and either go faster on those developments or work on more things faster because we have a bigger team to do stuff, and we don't need to duplicate the work.

So there's obviously a whole bunch of areas to kind of come together. But one of our operating principles with acquisitions and particularly in this case, is to not try to go too fast and certainly to not assume we know what is right for their business. we need to learn and understand each other and offer more than drive. And we have a lot of confidence that Kerrin will make the smart decisions with us to make the opportunities come together. So yes, it's a good performing business. We don't want to mess it up. We want to optimize it and make it better, and that's what we're going to do kind of over an extended time period.

Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Walravens with Citizens.

Kincaid LaCorte
Citizens JMP Securities, LLC, Research Division

Great. This is Kincaid on for Patrick. Congratulations on the quarter, guys. Eric, I just had a question on the Phone.com acquisition call, you had mentioned that you had very significant AI developments in the works. Could you give us any color on what that looks like?

Eric Stang
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes, a little bit. Being a company that handles a customer -- a business's phone calls and messages means we have a lot of data and a lot of opportunity to leverage that data with AI-type services.

Now what you see in the AI space today and the kind of things you'll certainly see from Ooma have to do with being able to parse all that data and get understanding from it, to evaluate it, things like sentiment analysis, and then also to use AI in other ways with the business to help the business gain productivity. It will be an area where we roll out features through the year next year, but we're excited about what we have coming in just the first quarter of next year. And it will go into our -- most of this will go into our Pro Plus tier, which we think will help drive a little bit higher adoption of our highest-tier service, which also helps our ARPU growth, which has been steadily growing on the business side, as you know.

So yes, it's -- that's how we look at it. And I guess I can't really say too much that's too specific at this point. But it's certainly an area where we've been -- we've done development in this area for over a year, and we're already using some of these capabilities internally at Ooma and we've learned a lot through that.

And I think that's also important because when it comes to small businesses, and our secret sauce is our ability to understand the environment of a small business, you need to offer very clear value and make it very simple and easy to set up and use. And I think we're going to come out with a solution that ticks all those boxes well for our customers.

Kincaid LaCorte
Citizens JMP Securities, LLC, Research Division

Spectacular. And then a quick follow-up. This is your eighth acquisition in 11 years. I'm just curious if there's any learnings going from the first one until now that you can highlight for us?

Eric Stang
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes, there are. I hadn't counted eight actually, but I appreciate you doing so I think the first observation is an obvious one that everyone would talk about with acquisitions, which is the closer the acquisition is to what you already know how to do, the easier it is for you to understand it and the easier it is for you to leverage it and make it a success.

And so if you look at our -- perhaps our worst acquisition, it was one where we were branching out into the camera space with a small acquisition we made. And we never really did get that right. And the acquisitions we've made, the last several, we're very happy with. The OnSIP acquisition, going back 3 or more years now, that business continues to perform very well, in fact, better than our expectations when we acquired them. 2600Hz, we really bought them mainly for technology control and synergy, but then the market opened up with opportunity for wholesale platforms in general, and we've been able to also drive a revenue story there. And now with these two acquisitions, I think we're very well placed to leverage them as part of having a greater scale and therefore, better economics overall as a company.

It -- we do look at our cost of acquiring customers through sales and marketing and our cost of acquiring customers through acquisition. And we are balancing both of those, and it's one reason why you saw our sales and marketing down at 26% of revenue for Q3 because with these acquisitions, we're able to drive very strong growth for the company and we can really optimize across all areas with that. So that's a little bit -- I probably went on a little bit, but that's how we're seeing things, and that's a little bit of what we've learned.

Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrigan with the Benchmark Company.

Matthew Harrigan
The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division

This is just a [ nit, ] but you're so careful on guidance. Do you have any feel for what the non-GAAP charges on the acquisition FluentStream would be? The noncash comp and the -- sorry, the stock compensation and the acquisition expenses, I assume it might be high 6 figures.

And then secondly, the Vegas hotel, more than 1,000 rooms, is that presumably a gaming company with material other assets outside Las Vegas where you could get further penetration?

Shigeyuki Hamamatsu
Senior VP & CFO

I'll answer the first one, I guess, I'll let Eric answer the second one. But the -- so with respect to FluentStream, we're not able to give you the range of estimate around non-GAAP charges in terms of intangibles. There will be some tax-related entries for the intangibles we're going to book, so we can't give you that because that process takes some time to figure out after the close, which just occurred a week ago. And there's almost no minimal -- no stock comp charge associated with the -- there's no stock issued by the way, in closing the transaction. But prospectively, too, there's very minimal stock comp. So we expect the stock comp to be -- stay at similar level even post-close.

Eric Stang
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Regarding the hotel win in Las Vegas, it was nearly 1,000 rooms, it wasn't over. But yes, really excited to win this customer. Our goal internally is to add more than 50 hotels every quarter on our Ooma Enterprise platform. We did that again in Q3. And this hotel, I actually don't know if they're part of a larger chain or not. They are -- I just don't know. But they're certainly a major hotel in Las Vegas.

Matthew Harrigan
The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division

And are you seeing anything on the SMB side that gives you pause on the economy to the extent that, that business is economically sensitive?

Eric Stang
President, CEO & Chairman

We are not. No.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Arjun Bhatia with William Blair.

Arjun Bhatia
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Eric, I'm just curious, you're kind of acquiring FluentStream and Phone.com, presumably, they'll be -- you'll be integrating those and working through the acquisitions at the same time. They're decent-sized deals. And you've obviously done M&A in the past, but you're going to have to deal with these two together. Can you just give us kind of your capacity to absorb both businesses at the same time throughout fiscal '27?

Eric Stang
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes, happy to. It's obviously something we thought a lot about. Our -- one of our key goals is not to derail in any way the things Ooma is already doing as we bring these businesses into the family. We feel pretty comfortable, partly because FluentStream is already operating at a very high level. And Phone.com is as well, but Phone.com is more of an opportunity for the future, given the strength of the Phone.com brand and URL and the high level of e-commerce business the company does. E-commerce is a very cost-effective means for growth as well.

So we really want to bring our sales and marketing strength to that business. Our team is probably -- I wouldn't be surprised if it's 10x the size of theirs in terms of just the marketing side of what we do. And we're going to see how that unfolds over time. But there's nothing that neither one of these businesses has something that has to get done tomorrow with the exception of one or two very small things. So it gives us the luxury to take them at the pace that works for us.

And so I think we'll be able to bring them on board very straightforwardly. And at some point, we would like to do more acquisitions because this is proving to be a very cost-effective and good method of growth for us. And if we can find more opportunities, we're open to that.

Arjun Bhatia
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Understood. That's very helpful. And then just on the business segment, you obviously had the nice win with the hotel in Vegas. When you're looking at the competitive dynamics there, just curious, where are you seeing the most sort of incremental share gains from? Like who are the incumbents you're booting out there? And how is that competitive landscape changed over the last year or so?

Eric Stang
President, CEO & Chairman

So in hospitality, hotels, they're almost always replacing a legacy on-site PBX or something that's really quite old. And so that's the trend of moving to the cloud that's been going on for quite a number of years now. But hotels and hospitality have some unique requirements, and we've been able to customize our Ooma Enterprise solution to fit the needs there very well. Competitively, we haven't seen much change.
