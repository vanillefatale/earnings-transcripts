Our first question today comes from Ben Swinburne at Morgan Stanley.

Benjamin Swinburne
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Bob, I think we've been talking about ESPN going direct-to-consumer for, I don't know, it feels like a decade or so now. And you've got the product in the market. I know it's not been a ton of time but I'm wondering if you could share a little bit about what you've learned so far in terms of adoption, engagement, anything interesting in terms of what kind of packages people are attracted to? And really, the question is, does this product kind of change the outlook in any meaningful way for the business as you look out over the longer term. And I just want to ask Hugh on the cash from operations guidance that you provided. With the $1.7 billion cash tax swing, if I sort of adjust for that, I'm getting kind of underlying growth of well over 20%. So is there anything else we should be thinking about? Maybe it's the One Big Beautiful Bill tax benefits or anything else in the cash outlook that suggests such a strong cash flow year in 2026?

Robert Iger
CEO & Director

Ben, I'll take the first part of your question. The ESPN launch has been a real success for a number of reasons. First of all, what we set about to do was to attract basically new users, people who had either been subscribers to the multichannel linear bundle or people who had not but wanted to engage more with ESPN. And we've done extremely well in that regard, signing up essentially new users. The other thing we wanted to do was, we wanted to give people who wanted to stay in the multichannel linear bundle a chance to use the app and to engage with us more deeply because the app has so many more features than the linear channels do. And the authentication rate of people who are already subscribers has been very, very encouraging. Third, we ended up signing up a substantial number of subscribers to the -- what we call the ultra product or the ultimate ESPN product, which is essentially mostly attracting cord nevers, people who want to engage with sports but maybe they don't want to engage as deeply as those that get linear channels or those that subscribe to the main app. So it's been very successful in that regard.

We're encouraged that people have found all the new features and are using them, particularly the SportsCenter for you and what we call Verts, which is essentially just vertical sports highlights. And the algorithm seems to be working as well. I know it's working for me, where if you watch certain videos on ESPN and particularly if you click like, then your feed is populated by sports news and sports highlights that you are more interested in. So I guess in almost every way you look at it, it has worked. It's also working for advertisers because obviously, there's real value in the data that we provide advertisers on the direct-to-consumer platform. And so we're attracting both more advertising and new advertisers to the service. And as we look ahead, we believe that we've created a product that is very, very consumer-friendly, very advertiser-friendly and actually works both for the traditional distribution ecosystem and for what I'll call the DTC ecosystem, if there is such a thing.

So we're very, very encouraged. I think it's a very positive step for the future of ESPN because while nothing necessarily provides future-proof concepts or circumstances for a business that is constantly changing but this certainly is a step in the direction of solidifying ESPN's future going forward. The last thing that I'll say is, the great thing about the app is this incredible variety of sports that you can access on it. So where the linear channels provide, obviously, live sports and studio programming, more what I'll call along the lines of the traditional sports television, the new app gives users a chance to engage with thousands and thousands more sports events over the year. And I think that's not only a sports fan's delight but I think overall, it's about as consumer-friendly as it gets.

Hugh Johnston
Senior Executive VP & CFO

Okay, Ben. Yes and I'll take the question on cash flow. You're right. If you adjust for tax, we're up about 28% year-over-year. Because of the timing on tax payments, the reported number is closer to 7%, driven by a couple of things. #1, obviously, OI growth is quite strong. #2, we've been investing for a couple of years and we've now sort of leveled off in terms of those levels of investment. That's something that we think you can look forward to in the out years, continued strong free cash flow growth from Disney, which obviously gives us a lot of flexibility in terms of the ability to return cash to shareholders, which was evidenced today by the doubling in the share repurchase and the 50% increase in the dividend. So we feel very good about the free cash flow growth going forward.

Robert Iger
CEO & Director

Before we take the next question, Carlos, I just want to add something to the question that Ben Swinburne asked about ESPN. One of the things that we're also very encouraged by is the fact that of the subscribers that have signed up to the new app, a substantial number of them, about 80% have signed up to what we call the trio bundle, which includes Disney+ and Hulu.

Our next question comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo.

Steven Cahall
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So just on content, you had a pretty strong last couple of years in general entertainment. Bob, you talked about some of the things like Alien: Earth and FX that have done really well. As we look into this year for the studio, I mean, it's a big slate with Avatar and Moana. You're off to a little bit stronger or a softer start, I think, implied in the guide for the first quarter. So I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about what kind of growth you think you can do at the studio this year or over the next couple of years? And then, Hugh, just a tactical one. Given the ongoing carriage dispute with YouTube TV, have you provisioned anything in the EPS guidance for a sustained blackout? Or is the economic impact actually more minimal because you think those folks would resubscribe elsewhere, including maybe the ESPN app?

Robert Iger
CEO & Director

Hugh, I'll take the first part of the question, Steven, thank you. We're very encouraged by the studio slate that is coming up. In fact, we have a premiere of Zootopia 2 tonight. That is our Thanksgiving release. And then we finish the calendar year with Avatar: Fire and Ash. Obviously, we have very, very high hopes for that. And if you look at the slate for the rest of the year, it's about as strong as it's been in a while, maybe stronger than it's been in a while, including the Mandalorian, Toy Story 5, live-action Moana and then we're going to finish the calendar year with Avengers: Doomsday. So we are very bullish on the slate ahead. As we look at the slate well into '27 and into '28, we feel that we've got similar strength to the strength that I just described for fiscal and calendar year '26.

Obviously, not every film works. We've seen -- we know that. We've been around long enough to understand that. But if you look back at the year and look at the fact that we've already crossed substantial box -- global box office level, we feel that we had some real strength, 2 $1 billion films in the fiscal year, the biggest film of the year, fiscal 2025 and calendar 2025 to date, which was Lilo & Stitch, which also had tremendous, tremendous consumption when it went on the platform. So we feel good about the direction of the studio, both the current slate that's coming up and what it looks like in the future.

Hugh Johnston
Senior Executive VP & CFO

Right. And Steven, just to add to Bob's comments, in terms of Q1, that's more about what we're overlapping rather than the slate for the year itself. Just the timing of the overlap, particularly with Avatar coming at the very end of Q1 is what's driving the guide that we shared with you all. As it relates to the discussions with YouTube, obviously, I'm not going to comment much on ongoing negotiations that are live right now. The only thing I would say is in terms of our guidance, we built a hedge into that with the expectation that these discussions could go for a little while. In terms of the dollar impacts, keep in mind, there's 2 pieces to it. There's the piece that we're not getting paid for and then the piece that we're picking up by virtue of subscribers moving elsewhere. So -- but beyond that, I don't want to comment because it is a live negotiation right now.

Next question comes from Robert Fishman at MoffettNathanson.

Robert Fishman
MoffettNathanson LLC

Bob, as we think about Disney+ as a portal to all things Disney, can you talk about the future road map and how subscribers will be able to use Disney+ as a super app for not only Hulu and ESPN that you started to talk about but also engage with your parks and other assets? And then, Hugh, do you see a path ahead for sustained double-digit DTC revenue growth through a combination of subscriber engagement and advertising increases?

Robert Iger
CEO & Director

Thanks, Robert. First of all, regarding Disney+, we're in the midst of rolling out the biggest and the most significant changes from a product perspective, from a technology perspective since we launched the service in 2019. And we're really encouraged because it's enabling greater personalization, resulting in a product that's just more dynamic, more engaging. It's basically it's working. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we've turned Hulu into a global general entertainment brand, which we think is going to create more awareness and basically create closer alignment with our U.S. product. So as we look ahead, these things are obviously all designed to create a 1-app experience but we also see, particularly with the deployment of AI, the opportunity to use Disney+, as you suggested, as a portal to all things Disney. There's clearly an opportunity for commerce. There's an opportunity to use it as an engagement engine for people who want to go to our theme parks, want to stay at our hotels or want to enjoy our cruises, our cruise ships.

And obviously, there's a huge opportunity for games and the investment that we made and the agreement that we reached with Epic Games, while that will largely be on their platform, gives us an opportunity to integrate a number of game-like features into Disney+. The other thing that we're really excited about that AI is going to give us the ability to do, is to provide users of Disney+ with a much more engaged experience, including the ability for them to create user-generated content and to consume user-generated content, mostly short form, from others. So a lot going on. We're pleased that -- with the progress that we've already made from a technology perspective. We've made some great hires, by the way, in the last year in that regard, including Adam Smith, who's also brought in some real talent. And the opportunity here, we think, is enormous in terms of increasing our engagement with Disney fans across the world.

Hugh Johnston
Senior Executive VP & CFO

Okay. And Robert, regarding your question on DTC, a couple of comments. #1, obviously, we guided you to the double-digit margins as we've been talking about in the past and as was expected coming into the year. #2, in no way are we going to get there through cost cutting. The way we're going to get there is through revenue growth and through driving operating leverage through the business. We didn't give a specific revenue guide but our objective and our aspiration is very much to be growing the top line of that business by double digits as we did on an apples-to-apples basis in Q4. That's what we're looking to do going forward, is to grow the top line double digits. And again, as a reminder and as we've discussed in the past, getting beyond '26, we're certainly looking to gain margin in chunks, not in basis points as we think beyond '26 and into the future. We think this is a terrific business that's really going to be super strategic for The Walt Disney Company and is going to be a growth driver for us for many years to come.

Our next question today comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities.

Jessica Reif Cohen
BofA Securities, Research Division

I got a couple of things. One, you've grown content via both building and buying. And clearly, if we're going to see M&A in media in the coming year with a lot of moving pieces across the industry, some being just -- some companies being broken up. So I'm just wondering, do you see any role for Disney? And if not, any concern that you'll see a stronger competitor coming out of all of this? And then secondly, on advertising, could you maybe go a little bit under the covers. There are a lot of things going on in DTC and linear, both entertainment and sports. Could you give us some color on your outlook for fiscal '26?

Hugh Johnston
Senior Executive VP & CFO

Go ahead, Bob. Sorry.

Robert Iger
CEO & Director

Go ahead.

Hugh Johnston
Senior Executive VP & CFO

So Jessica, on M&A, a couple of things. #1, obviously, we don't comment on M&A specifically. That said, with what's happening in the industry right now, Bob and the team really built the IP portfolio that we have over the last decade, whether it was the Fox acquisition or Lucas or Pixar. So we actually feel like we've got a great portfolio and we don't need to do anything. From that perspective, I think we'll let this play out. In terms of other competitors, we'll see how the various moves play out. But we like the hand that we have right now. So I wouldn't expect us to participate in making any significant moves. As it relates to the advertising side, what you saw for the year for us last year was, advertising grew 5%.

Sports was particularly strong. DTC obviously has had supply coming into the market. That said, we did see CPMs improve at Disney over the last 2 quarters. So we feel like that's trending in the right direction. And then from a linear perspective, obviously, that's driven by what happens with subscribers. Going forward, we do expect advertising growth going into '26 as well despite the fact that we're overlapping political advertising in the first quarter of '26. So.

Our next question today comes from Michael Morris at Guggenheim.

Michael Morris
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Wanted to ask you first on the Experiences business. Can you talk a little bit more about the drivers of the segment into fiscal '26 in the context of that high single-digit operating income growth that you guided to? So how is demand currently trending? And how much of the guided growth comes from revenue as opposed to margin expansion in the coming year? And if I could ask one on the sports side. You talked about some of the content-driven cost pressure in the second and third quarters of the year. I would assume that comes from the NBA investment. Can you talk a bit about how the NBA investment is positive for you and will drive your growth over time?

Hugh Johnston
Senior Executive VP & CFO

Okay. Yes, happy to jump in on both of those. In terms of the Experiences business and drivers for '26, obviously, we've made big investments in cruise and we're expecting cruise to be a meaningful contributor to growth of Experiences during the course of the year, particularly in the second half as we get past the launch costs and some of the dry docks that we have in the first half of the year. #2, obviously, we're always going to have a combination of some pricing and some attendance growth. So certainly feel positive about that. And then obviously, with the slate that we have coming on the films side, consumer products ought to be a meaningful contributor as well.

As far as sports goes, from the perspective of the NBA, because of the timing of the rights cost, it does create a little bumpiness during the course of the year. Again, the latter half is where we'll really see material growth in ESPN. And then in terms of NBA being a contributor, the NBA is obviously a phenomenal property. We were fortunate enough to get out in front of that and create an attractive deal, both for the NBA and for ourselves. It obviously, like a lot of other live sports, attracts audience and in the case of the NBA, like the NFL, attracts scale audience, which obviously is super attractive to advertisers and therefore, is strategically beneficial to us as well.

Michael Morris
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

If I could follow up, can you share anything about what you're seeing on the demand side currently domestically for the parks in terms of advanced bookings or per caps?

Hugh Johnston
Senior Executive VP & CFO

Yes, yes. Sorry, I forgot to answer that portion of your question. Bookings are up 3% in the first quarter. So feel good about that and they're also up for the year. So feel good about where demand is right now.

And our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays.

Kannan Venkateshwar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Bob, any interest from you on becoming a broader bundler of streaming? You already have ESPN, Disney+ and Hulu bundled. And of course, you also have Fox One and HBO. And it feels like there's an opportunity here for Disney to maybe emerge as a new form of bundler, which nobody in the industry appears to have attempted yet. So any thoughts on that would be great. And then just to understand the impact of ESPN bundling on Disney+ and Hulu a little bit better. Anything you can share with respect to maybe the churn benefits or any kind of subscriber acquisition cost tailwinds that you saw in the quarter, what you expect going forward potentially from that?

Robert Iger
CEO & Director

So I'll answer both parts of your question. First of all, as it relates specifically to ESPN bundling, what we found is that subscribers that bundle, either they bundle Disney+ and Hulu or subscribers that bundle Disney+, Hulu and ESPN are healthier subscribers in the sense that the churn rates are lower than the subscriber that only subscribes to 1 app. So what I mentioned earlier is the fact that about 80% of all the subscribers to the new ESPN service are actually buying the trio or the triple bundle. That's a very positive sign for us in terms of lowering churn into the future. We've also found that bundling with others, for instance, we've been bundling with Max in the United States, also has a lower -- an effect of lowering churn.

And we've expressed the desire to do more bundling with other companies and have been in discussions on and off with other companies about doing just that. So typically, the opportunity to bundle definitely exists -- and to bundle more exists. And we also have proven that it works both for us in terms of our subscribers and also for the subscribers that we attract for the bundling entity. If you were to ask the folks at Warner Bros. Discovery about the impact of the Max bundle on them, they would tell you that they've signed up a substantial number of subscribers thanks to the bundle with us.

Our next question today comes from John Hodulik with UBS.

John Hodulik
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Great. A quick follow-up on the parks business and then a question on cruises. It looks like domestic parks attendance was a little light in the fourth quarter. Hugh, is that driven by sort of competition, macro? Or are there any other factors that may have accounted for that? And then on the cruise side, just comment on overall demand for the cruise business. And I think -- could you remind us how are the margins in cruises compared to overall margins in the parks business? And what should be the impact on that segment as that business grows as fast as it's slated to over the next several years?

Hugh Johnston
Senior Executive VP & CFO

Okay. In terms of the demand, demand was -- I wouldn't characterize it as light. It basically came in, in line with our expectations. We've talked about Epic in the past, in particular, as something that we knew was going to be a factor in domestic parks and in fact, was very much in line with our expectations. If anything, it seems to be, in fact, impacting the rest of the competition down in Florida, more than it's impacting us. From a consumer perspective, we certainly feel good about it. In terms of demand for cruise, very, very strong despite the fact that we've added as much capacity as we have. Our utilization rates are in line with what we've seen in the past. So we're filling all of that capacity as quickly as we can add it. Regarding margins, we don't really talk about specifics on cruise margins. That's not a disclosed item. But obviously, it's a very attractive business. We're capable of pricing it at a good level. The guest satisfaction scores are higher than basically anything else in the company. So the margins in that business, as you would imagine, are quite attractive.

Our next question today comes from Kutgun Maral with Evercore ISI.

Kutgun Maral
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Two, if I could. First on direct-to-consumer. I was hoping you could share some of the puts and takes on the cost side in 2026 and especially as you continue to invest in technology and programming but I didn't know if there were some maybe cost savings associated with integrating the tech stacks, for example, that we should be mindful of? And then, Hugh, just a housekeeping one, if I could, around the 53rd week. Thank you for providing a clean guidance for the year and -- on an underlying basis. With that, can you help quantify the impact of the extra week to this year? And as we look to fiscal '27, would the expectation be that you could grow EPS double digits again even without adjusting for the 53rd week comp?

Hugh Johnston
Senior Executive VP & CFO

Yes. First on DTC, it's really consistent with what we've talked about in the past. So we expect to grow revenue at an attractive rate. As I mentioned earlier in the call, our aspiration is to be double digits in that business. In terms of then the line items underneath, we'll obviously continue to invest at a reasonable level in content, leaning a bit more towards the international side as we identify opportunities in specific markets to grow the international business where we have a big opportunity. In addition to that, we'll be investing in product. So the technology area will get some level of investment as well. And obviously, as we put the 2 businesses together, there's opportunities to do a bit of savings on SG&A.

That said, I would expect P&L leverage, in other words, expenses growing less quickly than revenue across all of those items, which is how we drive the margin growth that we would expect to see. In terms of the 53rd week, again, I would expect us to figure out as we get to Q4, what the 53rd week is worth. And then as we determine that, as we have in the past 2 times we've had the 53rd week, we would share something on that with investors and we'd look to grow double digits off of that.

And our final question today comes from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.

David Karnovsky
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Bob, you noted generative AI earlier but it sounded primarily as a use case within your apps. And I'm wondering how you view the opportunity or risk to license out content or IP to some of the emerging video creation platforms. And then just relatedly, as it pertains to production costs over time, what role do you see for generative AI to drive cost efficiencies in the business?

Robert Iger
CEO & Director

Very good question. We've been in some interesting conversations with some of the AI companies and I would characterize some of them as quite productive conversations as well, seeking to not only protect the value of our IP and of our creative engines but also to seek opportunities for us to use their technology to create more engagement with consumers. And we feel encouraged by some of the discussions that we're having. It's obviously imperative for us to protect our IP using -- or with this new technology. And we've been pretty engaged on that subject with a number of entities and I'm hopeful that ultimately, we'll be able to reach some agreement, either the industry or the company has on its own with some of these entities that would, in fact, reflect our need to protect the IP. We also -- as we look ahead, we see opportunities in terms of efficiency and effectiveness by deploying AI, not just in the production process but really across our company as we engage with our cast members and our employees but also our guests and our customers.

There are opportunities, as Hugh talked about earlier about what I'll call the office and creating efficiency there. There are great opportunities in terms of our collection of data and our mining of data. And I'd say, above all else, there's phenomenal opportunities to deploy AI across our direct-to-consumer platforms, both to provide tools that make the platforms more dynamic and more sticky with consumers but also to give consumers the opportunity to create on our platforms.

I also -- before we end the call, Carlos, I just want to say one thing because I know there was reference to where we are with YouTube. And I just want to end the call because we've been so engaged in this over the last few weeks, by kind of giving an overall summary of just where things stand. First of all, obviously, we care deeply about our consumer. And our priority has always been to remain on their service without interruption to close a deal on a timely basis so that interruption does not occur. The deal that we have proposed is equal to or better than what other large distributors have already agreed to. So we're not trying to really break any new ground.

And while we've been working tirelessly to close this deal and restore our channels to the platform, it's also imperative that we make sure that we agree to a deal that reflects the value that we deliver, which both YouTube, by the way and Alphabet have told us is greater than the value of any other provider. So we're not trying to break new ground. The offer that's on the table is commensurate with deals that we've already struck with actually distributors that are larger than they are. We're trying really hard, as I said, working tirelessly to close this deal and we're hopeful that we'll be able to do so on a timely enough basis to at least give consumers the opportunity to access our content over their platform.

Carlos Gomez
