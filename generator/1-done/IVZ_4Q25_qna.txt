[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bill Katz with TD Cowen.

William Katz
TD Cowen, Research Division

Just maybe picking up where you left off, Allison, on the capital return. Clearly, the extra $500 million of paydown with the MassMutual was a bit earlier than maybe most people expected. As you look ahead, can you talk a little bit about the priorities to bring down the remaining preferred and how you sort of thinking about capital deployment more broadly? And now that your balance sheet is in a better spot, would you start to think about M&A as a potential use of capital rather than continuing to repair the balance sheet?

Allison Dukes
Senior MD & CFO

Sure. Bill, so yes, as we think about our capital priorities from here and the prep, I mean, look, we've $1.5 billion repurchased in 2025. We were very pleased with that progress, $2.5 billion remaining. We did end the year with some balance on the revolver and of course, then redeemed another $500 million note in January. So as we think about the balance sheet from here, we've definitely got continued opportunity to, as I noted, using operating cash flows to work that revolver down. And then we've got the 5-year term loan that matures in 2030. I think with that, we're going to continue to make really good progress, and we're getting the balance sheet into a place where we're quite pleased. We do have the opportunity to continue discussions with MassMutual on repurchasing more of the preferred at some point, but we've got these near-term maturities that we want to focus on as we continue to make good progress.

And I think freeing up nearly $90 million in capital that's now available to the common shareholder, we're very pleased with. So with that in mind and as we think about our capital priorities from here, I'd start with, one, the increase in our share buybacks on the common side to $40 million this quarter as we seek to get our payout ratio up closer to 60% this year. We want to make sure we are balancing our capital priorities with returning capital to our common shareholders. And then as we think about M&A, I mean, look, we've always said that we -- our best opportunity is to continue to invest in ourselves and grow our own business. And I think you see the results of that over the last year. With the organic flows that we had and the base fee growth that we demonstrated in 2025, we've got tremendous opportunity within our own business profile to grow organically and to do so in a really shareholder-friendly manner.

And we still see a lot of momentum behind that, and we're going to continue to invest behind our own capabilities. And then we're leveraging that with the partnerships that we discussed today as well. And it gives us, again, a very capital-efficient and shareholder-friendly way to continue to grow our capabilities. So as we've always said, we'll never say never to M&A. It's just got to be the right fit, and we have a very well diversified and broad set of capabilities. And so where there might be opportunities to tuck other capabilities in, we're always opportunistic there. But we're very pleased with the opportunities that we've had to invest in ourselves and just balance our capital priorities.

Andrew Schlossberg
President, CEO & Director

Yes. The only -- Bill, the only thing I'd add, picking up where Allison left off, that not just the private market partnerships that we structured last year, but also the Canadian and Indian partnerships or JVs in the case of India that we set up, we feel really good about those as additional growth levers for the company.

William Katz
TD Cowen, Research Division

Great. And just one follow-up. Thanks for all the extra detail on the expense outlook. And I appreciate we're seeing here in January of 2026. As you look into next year, can you talk a little bit about just the off-ramp on the implementation costs? I presume that should trend towards 0. And then how do we think about maybe the incremental spend on the platform costs? And I would presume that would be more related to the equity book. Any color there as we think about '27 would be helpful.

Allison Dukes
Senior MD & CFO

Sure. So yes, you're correct that you should expect the implementation cost to trail off and then go away over the course of 2027. And as we get deeper into 2026, we'll give you further guidance on that. But it is reasonable to assume that those implementation costs do disappear over time. And there will be additional savings as we decommission existing systems and continue to streamline processes. That is, you are correct, somewhat offset by the quantum of AUM as we continue to progress with moving AUM onto these hybrid platforms, and we will be giving additional guidance to that as we get deeper into '26 and move into '27.

Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with BMO Capital Markets.

Brennan Hawken
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Would love to start out with the net revenue yield. Allison, you spoke to the exit rate at 22.7%. There were some moving pieces in the quarter for sure, not the least of which was the Qs, those that came in late. So what's the right way to think about all those moving pieces and the impact to net revenue yield on a go-forward basis? I know it's a hard one to try to predict, but maybe based upon what you know today, what would you say would be the further impact as we average in some of these factors that happened in the quarter?

Allison Dukes
Senior MD & CFO

Sure. You're absolutely correct. With the addition of the Qs as revenue, it does create some differing dynamics. I think, namely, it does create some level of stabilization in the net revenue yield just as you start to see just given the size of the QQQ and as it converts into 6 basis points of net revenue yield, you will start to see that stabilize, I think, the overall average and the mix there a bit more. It's very difficult to forecast net revenue yield, as you know, and it certainly has lots of quarterly dynamics, including things like day count and the market impact. All things being equal, though, we do think we're starting to see more and more stabilization and the Qs will offer even a further level of stabilization.

I think as you're thinking about just how you model revenue overall and how you think about some of our revenue dynamics, I do think it's important to look at third-party plus distribution fees as a percentage of management fees, which we've talked about a lot in the past, and that relationship is certainly changing with the addition of the Qs. You've got 18 basis points of Qs revenue that will run through management fees. The licensing and custodial fees of 12 basis points run through third-party contra revenues. And so that relationship is really moving higher, probably closer to the 22% to 23% range per quarter in 2026, which is quite a bit higher than where it had previously been around 13% or 14%. So I think those are all important factors as you think about some of the dynamics that could change now.

Andrew Schlossberg
President, CEO & Director

Brennan, it's Andrew. The one thing I'd add is that beyond the revenue yield, if you look at things like ETFs, fixed income, our cash business, these are all very at scale. And so thinking about the drive-through to profitability is also pretty critical.

Brennan Hawken
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Got it. Okay. And then sort of related, I know there's a lot of moving pieces with the expenses. A little tricky to follow all those parts. But just focusing in maybe on one part to start out here. You've historically talked about a 38% to 42% comp ratio, and it looked like you're starting to get back into that. But how should we think about the impact of the Qs and all the other moving pieces potentially impacting the comp ratio outlook? I would think moving to the lower end or maybe even adjusting the historical frame of reference of the 38% to 42% might make sense. But I would love to hear your thoughts on that and how we should think about the comp ratio going forward.

Allison Dukes
Senior MD & CFO

Sure. Good question. And there are a lot of moving pieces to the expense guide. And we recognize that, tried to be as clear as we could, but there are a lot of ins and outs as we continue to transform the business. As it relates to the comp ratio, the comp ratio that we point to is always a full year comp ratio. We really don't manage it quarter-to-quarter. We're always managing on a full year basis. And in 2025, the comp ratio ended at 42.7%. So again, above our historical guide of 38% to 42%. As I think about 2026, I think we will come back within that range. I think we'll be at the high end of that range. But with the addition of the Qs, it does help and it does start to stabilize the revenue base.

The reason we got out of line with that guide in some recent years is really as we saw a real pullback in revenue. So that stabilization and growing revenue back to where we need it to be, I think gives us the opportunity to pull the comp ratio back down, but it will be on the high end of that range. As we think about long term, look, we want to continue to invest in our business. We are continuing to remix our expense base. We are hiring in areas of growth. And that really -- I think the addition of the Qs revenue gives us the opportunity to continue to make selective and strong investments in our hiring.

Next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.

Glenn Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I guess a big picture question on your private market strategy thought process going forward. You did a couple of interesting, what I call capital-light partnerships, get you into other geographies, other asset classes. So is the big picture game plan to piece together a full across asset classes offering and maybe through capital-light JVs for now? And then if that's the case, I'm very curious on how branding is going to work in the wealth channel as you piece that together?

Andrew Schlossberg
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Let me start. Thanks for the question. Yes, the partnerships are meant to complete and build out the product capability set. The ones with Barings were focused on income and the partnership with LGT a little more towards total return and growth. That leaves us with other opportunities that we could look at with other partnerships to fill that out. But we're starting to get a pretty complete product lineup, in particular, trying to reach the wealth management markets in the U.S. and around the world and the defined contribution market, in particular, here in the U.S. Those partnerships did come, as you said, with capital committed by our respective partners.

And that's a really great way to get these strategies launched into those markets. So I think the combination of them plus our real estate offerings, our existing real estate offerings and our existing alternative credit offerings do give us a pretty complete picture. We don't want to oversaturate our product line either. We want to stay focused. But we really like this partnership model and structure. They're going to be co-managed both by us and our partners, which is really critical, and they're going to be singularly distributed by us in those markets in the U.S. as we announced. The branding will be pretty straightforward. It will be our brand, coupled with theirs where it makes sense. But given that we're the exclusive distributor, we're really trying to avoid and will avoid any kind of channel conflict whatsoever. That's critical to us, too.

Glenn Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

That was great, Andrew. I appreciate it.

Andrew Schlossberg
President, CEO & Director

Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Just maybe another cleanup on expenses before I have my follow-up more on the strategic side. But to Allison, I appreciate lots of moving pieces here. Maybe it would be helpful just to kind of level set where you guys expect the total dollar amount of expenses to be for 2026, assuming sort of flat markets. I heard you on the $3.2 billion jumping off point, but that's really just kind of annualizing Q4. There's a bunch of things that's going to come out. There's a bunch of things that's going to go in. So just to kind of level set, it might be helpful to get your sense of where '26 expenses could shake out again ex beta.

Allison Dukes
Senior MD & CFO

I think given all these moving parts and trying to land that would be probably not wise at this stage. I do think it's best to look at some of the moving parts given there's so much quarter-to-quarter fluctuation. I recognize it's rather frustrating. I find it rather challenging myself. But I'll say a couple of things. One, it's the right jumping off point. I do think it's important to remove the right revenues and the right expenses as we guided to as it relates to the sale of India and the sale of Intelliflo. Of course, we add back in 40% of India, but that's below the line. Important to look at some of what we were guiding to beginning in the second half of the year, beginning in the third quarter as it relates to Canada and the repositioning of that market, there will be impact to both revenue and expenses. And then, of course, there are some -- all the Alpha and the hybrid platform expense guides. Those will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. I do think the 25% sort of variable expense assumption is the right one.

On the comp to rev, again, kind of in that 38% to 42% range, but probably closer to 40%, 41% is where I would be thinking about that. I think it will get you pretty close to where we need to be, and we'll continue to give you guidance throughout the year. The one thing I want to point to is everything we're doing is with a focus towards operating margin expansion. And we have every expectation we will continue to grow operating margin this year. Everything we are doing is with an eye towards creating that positive operating leverage and expanding operating margin. And I feel very confident we are on a good, strong trajectory to continue to expand operating margin this year. On a full year basis, there will be some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. We've said all along, our objective is to get our operating margin into the mid-30s on a path back to the high 30s. And I think we will continue to make really good progress this year in our operating margin expansion objectives.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Great. No, that's super helpful. And I appreciate all the moving pieces as well. Strategically, just one for you guys as well. So incredible year really over the last 12 months, a number of big steps you guys made. As you look forward, do you still see parts of the business that are sort of subscale where you could do something similar where you exit them or JV them or kind of try to maneuver them to where sort of it makes sense? Or the sort of future strategic moves are likely to be more of kind of growth-related partnerships like we've seen you guys do with Barings and perhaps some of the others?

Andrew Schlossberg
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Alex. Let me start, and Allison should chip in as well. Look, we made a lot -- thank you for your comments. We made a lot of moves this year. I think it also presents or describes a lot of the creativity that I think is in the company to look for alternative ways to grow, all different ways to grow and I think we exhibited that. I would say from here, a lot of that foundational work has been done and the execution now is, I think, more clear and the resource alignment that we have towards these growth initiatives organically, I think, is more set. Things like expanding out our ETF business and our SMA business and our models business as personalization takes hold.

We're taking these private market partnerships and really starting to generate the organic growth in the retail markets to DC that we expect or the shift into fixed income as cash comes off the sidelines. The real growth that we've established in Asia and EMEA now that those are 40% of the long-term AUM base, so just a few examples of we have a lot to build off of the foundational work that we did. If we see opportunities to align with others in partnerships or other JVs, we will. But we've really laid a lot of that foundation, I think, thus far.

Allison Dukes
Senior MD & CFO

I think that's right. I mean there's not a lot that's obviously subscale, but there's still a lot of opportunity, I think, for improvement in our performance overall. And that's really our focus in 2026 around execution and continuing to drive a lot of these strategic initiatives all the way through. Some of these things are kind of announced, but not yet executed. And we've got a lot of work to do to bring these partnerships to life to close the partnership with CI in the second quarter of this year and to really then drill even deeper into the opportunity we have to improve execution overall. I think Andrew noted some of the strategic highlights that we see in our platform. But I don't want to leave anybody with the impression we kind of got all the fun things behind us. We now -- we had a lot of big rocks done, and we cleared a lot of ground for us to now focus, I think, even deeper into the firm this year and really refine our execution from here.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Great. Awesome.

And our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.

Daniel Fannon
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

So really strong flows from the China JV in the quarter. I was hoping you could discuss the outlook as we think about 2026, and maybe the diversity of some of the products that are driving that growth.

Andrew Schlossberg
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Dan, the growth in the China JV really persisted throughout the entire year. I think we did north of $20 billion in flows, and it was -- each quarter got successively better. A lot of that growth this year came in the balanced strategies, they call it fixed income plus. Those strategies, I think, really demonstrated people starting in China to get a little more confident in both the fixed income markets, but in this case, getting into the equity markets through these balanced funds. The stimulus and reforms that have happened in China continue to, I think, stimulate investors' interest in the markets.

They're pushing up consumption. There's less emphasis on the property sector. There has continued to be programs emphasizing market participation, long-term retirement growth. And then the easing trade tensions with the U.S., I think, has helped interest grow domestically, but also by foreign investors, in particular, in Europe and Asia into those markets. So the growth has been good. It's been pretty focused in those areas, as I mentioned. And we're seeing our passive ETF business also pick up, which is good to see.

Daniel Fannon
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. And then just as a follow-up, Allison, one more just on expenses and the hybrid investment platform. Obviously, those costs you said will roll off as we get into next year. But could you remind us, is this more about cost avoidance or we should actually see savings as we get into 2027?

Allison Dukes
Senior MD & CFO

That will be -- relative to 2026, yes, we will see savings in 2027. Cost avoidance, if we take it all the way back to the beginning of this over multiple years, I mean, look, Invesco is an entirely different Invesco than we were 5 years ago when we started this. And the opportunity was always about simplifying the overall operating system and really trying to create future cost avoidance. So it's hard to point to year-over-year savings going back to the beginning because our AUM is going to be almost double when we finish this from where we started. But the cost avoidance in the future as we think about the opportunities to garner the benefits of scale and the size of our AUM.

I think we will be pleased in the long run. But '27 relative to '26, yes, there will absolutely be savings, namely the implementation expenses that have been running in that $10 million to $15 million range per quarter. Those will taper off as effectively construction costs go away. And then as we move AUM fully onto the hybrid platform and have the opportunity to decommission systems on the other side, I think some of the operating expenses will improve in '27 relative to '26 as well. We're focused entirely right now on completing implementation in '26. But as we get closer to that, we will also begin getting more and more focused on how do we make sure we start to really drive the cost curve down in '27 and beyond.

Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.

Brian Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Great. Maybe just one more on expenses, just to clarify. So Allison, I think that if I could tally the things that you mentioned that have discrete impacts to that $3.2 billion expense base in '26, I think it accounted 5 different things. But they look like they mostly offset from things that you know. I know the timing is going to evolve throughout the year. So you did start that part in your commentary about $3.2 billion being a good starting point. It sounds like with those specific impacts, $3.2 billion is also a good starting point for 2026. Obviously, we're going to be layering in variable expenses and investment in the business on top of that. But I just wanted to make -- I just wanted to clarify if that $3.2 billion is the right number to start with given the isolated impacts that you mentioned for the different businesses, including the QQQ marketing budgets.

Allison Dukes
Senior MD & CFO

It's the right number to start with, but you just highlighted a great one, yes, with the QQQ marketing budget getting fully layered in, in 2026, which was not present in 2025 or in the fourth quarter of that run rate that we start with. So it is absolutely the right number to start with. And then as you think about the puts and takes, I think it will get you to something a bit higher than $3.2 billion, but also with revenue that's quite a bit higher than 2025 as well.

Brian Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Yes. Okay. Great. And then more strategically, can you talk about traction? Maybe Andrew, talk about traction in the defined contribution channel, what are you hearing from different potential plan sponsors in terms of their warming up to adding private markets to 401(k)? And how do you view that positioning? And I know it's a great long-term opportunity, but are you seeing actual traction building here this coming year?

Andrew Schlossberg
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean we've seen a lot of discussions, a little bit of traction in the United States, but where we're actually seeing more traction is in the United Kingdom and in places across Europe where there's also retirement reform going on and more private markets participation in things like defined contribution plan. So we do think this is a long-term trend, private markets into DC. We also would point out it's not just a U.S. trend. And I think owing to the fact how diverse our portfolio is and how strong we are outside of the U.S., too, that we view this as kind of a multilayer proposition. We certainly have the product offering to start to fill that out for institutions and plan sponsors. But we're also going to be, with the addition of the LGT partnership, focusing on that with them as well. And they have a very strong reputation in the institutional markets.

Gregory Ketron
Head of Investor Relations & Treasury

Okay, operator, we have time for one more question.

Operator

Our next question comes from Ben Budish with Barclays.

Benjamin Budish
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Maybe just a couple more housekeeping questions on Canada and some of the moving parts from this quarter. So Allison, you mentioned that we should see an operating income drag starting in the third quarter, but you expect it to ease over time. Any more color in terms of what assets we -- or what sort of asset groups we should see that come out of? Any other sort of geography impacts we should be aware of? And then just what's your thoughts on the time line for when you expect that to start to grind more closer to breakeven or positive?

Allison Dukes
Senior MD & CFO

Sure. So again, we don't expect to close that transaction until late in the second quarter. So we believe this will start to impact results in the third quarter. From a revenue perspective, you would see revenue on a quarterly basis decline by $15 million to $20 million net -- on a net basis for the sale of those mutual funds, net of the sub-advisory revenue that we expect to garner there. On an expense basis, we expect expenses to kind of start in the kind of $5 million to $10 million range in terms of -- $5 million to $10 million lower beginning in the third quarter, but trending higher towards that $10 million range over, call it, 2 to kind of 4 quarters as we get into 2027.

So that net operating income impact of $5 million to $10 million starting on the high side of $10 million lower quarter, kind of trending lower as we get into 2027. When you think about those expenses and the $5 million to $10 million of expenses, a majority -- half to more of that is going to be on the compensation side. So that will actually take a little bit of time to work down as we continue to really reposition our overall workforce in Canada related to this transaction. But there's also some impact to property and office as we will have some reduction in locations in Canada and some impact to G&A as well. So it's split between those 3 categories with the majority in compensation.

Andrew Schlossberg
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean when you look at the strategy behind what we did in Canada and partnering with CI, we'll be managing, as I mentioned, the sub-advised portion of the assets for all the global strategies, all the non-Canadian strategies with all of our existing teams. And as those -- as demand and flows grow through CI, that will give us a good opportunity to continue to grow revenue through our existing investment teams. We'll no longer manage the Canadian portion of those funds. That will stay with CI.

Allison Dukes
Senior MD & CFO

So while there is some short-term operating income impact, we absolutely believe this is the long-term right strategic move for Canada. And that as we get into the latter half of '27 and beyond, that this will absolutely have been the right move. We really do feel strongly that this partnership positions this business for better growth than we were going to be able to deliver on our own. And in doing so, we're going to take the opportunity to really look at our expense base and see where we can go even further as we get into 2027 related to all of our operations in Canada that gives us that opportunity to turn this into, I think, a long-term really positive move for the firm.

Benjamin Budish
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Understood. If I could just double check. Are there any cash flow implications and any proceeds from the sale? Or has that not been disclosed?

Allison Dukes
Senior MD & CFO

It's pretty negligible relative to the cost that we will incur with some of the repositioning that we're referring to. So it will be immaterial.

Benjamin Budish
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Understood.

Allison Dukes
Senior MD & CFO

Thank you.

Andrew Schlossberg
President, CEO & Director

Okay. So just in closing here, we really want to stress that we're unlocking value across the organization for the benefit of our clients and for our shareholders. And as you can see, we made significant progress in 2025. This includes looking at how we fundamentally operate and evaluating every opportunity as we strive to improve client outcomes, generate operating leverage and profitability, continue to build a strong balance sheet, enhance our ability to return capital to shareholders.

We have resilient operating performance across many key value drivers and our global platform has a significant and unique Asia Pacific presence and a strong performing EMEA business, coupled with our scale and breadth of products positions us really well to perform through shifting market dynamics. We continue to demonstrate that we have durable performance and reason to be optimistic about the future. I want to thank everybody for joining the call today, and please do reach out to our Investor Relations team for any additional questions. And we really appreciate your interest in Invesco, and we look forward to speaking with all of you again soon.
