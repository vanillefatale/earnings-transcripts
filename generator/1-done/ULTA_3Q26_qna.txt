[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.

Lorraine Maikis
BofA Securities, Research Division

Can you talk about what you're hearing from brands about pricing? The 3.8% ticket comp was very impressive. Do you think this might build in the coming quarters?

Kecia Steelman
President, CEO & Director

Lorraine, thanks for the question. I would say that we generally have pricing increases quarter-to-quarter as brands come through. And we had -- there were plenty of publicly traded companies that announced that they were taking price increases, e.l.f., Coty and Helen of Troy, just to name a few, that we were seeing some price increases with this quarter.

Chris, maybe I'll let you give a little bit more color around what the pricing increases look like for the quarter. But pricing increases are not new in this part of the business, and I don't think that we saw anything that was like extraordinary by any means. Chris?

Chris Lialios
Senior VP, Interim CFO & Controller

Yes. Lorraine, thank you for the question. As we mentioned, we are starting to see more market-wide price increases come through with select brands versus Q2. But we continue to work with our brand partners to understand how they're thinking about tariff mitigation going forward and price increases.

And they are being very thoughtful considering the consumer wallet pressures and making sure that we continue to provide value to our guests. As far as how the price increases flow through the P&L, as I had mentioned, there is a short-term benefit to cost of goods as we sell through the product. But eventually, that catches up as we sell through the older product and we replenish with newer product.

Your next question will come from Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities.

Steven Forbes
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Kecia, you mentioned solid app engagement and also app online sales penetration. So I was curious if you can maybe just give us more color around what you're seeing from the consumer standpoint and whether consumers are actually migrating to purchasing across channels as you think about the mix of customers that are maybe dual channel purchasers versus single-channel purchasers.

And the reason I ask, right, as you think about that 15% or mid-teens e-commerce growth profile, it's sort of indicative of really strong wallet share and market share performance. So just trying to gain conviction around what's driving that.

Kecia Steelman
President, CEO & Director

Well, thanks, Steve, for the question. What I would like to highlight first is that we've had strength in both categories because stores are continuing to grow, too. And if you look at the percentage of our business, 80% of our business is still coming from stores. Our app engagement, we're really pleased with what we're seeing. It grew 65% from 63% last quarter.

And we are building on our momentum in e-com. We've had 3 consecutive quarters of double-digit comp. I think that there's a couple of things that are playing into that. We've introduced new capabilities in 2025 that are really helping us strengthen our momentum in e-com. In Q1, we had Split Card launching, which made you could pick it up in the store, you could have something you sent to your home. That was a new technology that we didn't previously have.

In Q2, we launched Replenish & Save. Q3 Wishlist and Venmo just in time for the holiday season. And then as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've added -- we have 1,000 stores now for ship from stores. So speed is really important. As our investments are continuing to elevate our digital experience and this whole acceleration around personalization is fueling our performance, it's really driving both channels up.

And we're really pleased with what we're seeing across both stores and e-com. What I will say is I'll just finish by saying that there's no finish line in our technology and our advancements and the investments that we're making. And it's just great to see that our Ulta Beauty unleash plans and what we're investing in is really starting to come through and show on the top line sales.

Your next question will come from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital.

Anthony Chukumba
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Congrats on a really strong quarter. I guess my first question is, I look at your comp performance on a 2-year stack basis. This is the second quarter where the comp accelerated on a 2-year stack basis. And I guess -- and I know it's probably hard to parse this out super finitely, but I was just wondering how much of that do you think is the product newness versus the better execution in store versus the better promotions? Maybe it's a mix of all of that. And it does sound like the industry is continuing to grow. So how do you just sort of think about that?

Kecia Steelman
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think it's all -- thanks, Anthony, for the question. I'll start by saying that, but I would say it's all of that really playing in together. And what I'm seeing is that the company is really hitting on all cylinders. We have a very clear plan, and everyone is working on the Ulta Beauty Unleashed plan and understands the role that they play. I couldn't be more pleased with what I'm seeing also from our frontline associates all the way to the senior executive team and really raising to the occasion and really driving the business.

I'd say that there's 4 areas that we're really leaning into. It's merchandising, especially this time of year, we're really focused on gifting. Fragrance, we called out was really strong. We've got a lot of holiday exclusives and newness that's driving the business. In digital, our capabilities, which I just shared in the last question, they're really driving that e-commerce channel. Marketing, we're amplifying the ways that we're communicating. We've launched our new brand equity campaign.

And then it's all underpinned by operations and just delivering on a great guest experience from in-stocks to guest satisfaction and the speed in which we're delivering products to our stores. So it's the game plan working together collectively along with the team supporting it that I think is where you're seeing the momentum come. And we're going against the Super Bowl of the season here in fourth quarter, and we're just going to continue to lean into our operational excellence and continuing to deliver the best results that we can have for the rest of this year.

Your next question will come from Anna Andreeva with Piper Sandler.

Anna Andreeva
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Great. Let me add my congrats. Great quarter. We had a follow-up on SG&A. How much of that growth was the incremental brand campaign that you guys did during the quarter? And you've talked about '25 being more of a catch-up year in terms of investments. Can you talk about if we should expect '26 SG&A to be managed closer to sales? What areas are you guys still investing in? And not sure if you can comment how we should think about Space NK contribution to sales and as we think about SG&A for next year?

Chris Lialios
Senior VP, Interim CFO & Controller

Thank you for the question, Anna. I'll start off with the SG&A increase. As you know, we deleveraged about 240 basis points primarily due to higher incentive comp, store payroll and benefit expense and store expenses and the amortization of cloud-based software. As far as breaking out the advertising piece, we leveraged our advertising as a result of the higher top line revenue. And as far as the growth of store payroll expense, we -- again, it's primarily due to additional selling hours to support the guest experience.

Kecia Steelman
President, CEO & Director

And then we're going to share more about our SG&A plans in March when we're going to talk about our 2026 plans. But we understand and I shared in the comments, this is an investment year, and we knew that. And this was what the plan was, and we look like we're going to be hitting what our forecast has been that we've shared earlier. But we'll be able to share more about what the plans around SG&A in March.

Your next question will come from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.

Rupesh Parikh
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Also congrats on a really nice quarter. So Kecia, just on the brand -- or I guess, the innovation pipeline, the exclusive brands. I know last year your team was very upbeat in terms of innovation for this year. So just curious, based on your current visibility into next year, just how do you feel about the pipeline out there?

Kecia Steelman
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks for the question, Rupesh. Our merchandising vision is to really curate and inspire guests with the best beauty and wellness assortment for all life stages. And Lauren has come in and really brought some great thought leadership and is really helping us refine the merchandising vision and brand building strategy.

What I will say is that our merchants have been hard at work in developing their plans for fiscal 2026. We have an exciting pipeline of newness, and I'm pleased with what I see right now. And it's balanced across the portfolio, very similar to how this year was. So while we're in the midst of our planning, and I'll share more specifics in March, the team has done a really nice job, and they have really prioritized newness and innovation because we know how important it is to really drive this business overall. So I feel bottom line, really great about what I'm seeing for 2026.

Your next question will come from Kelly Crago with Citi.

Kelly Crago
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the great quarter. Kecia, I was hoping you will elaborate on your philosophy around your EBIT margin, long-term EBIT margin of 12%. You're running ahead of that this year despite significant SG&A deleverage. Should we still anchor to the 12% as we think about F '26? And with that, you talked about SG&A maybe finding some efficiencies, is SG&A a source of leverage as we look forward? Or will you still sort of try to drive the gross margin and maybe invest against that?

Kecia Steelman
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Kelly, for the question. I will say this is a great position to be in because we're outperforming what the original plan was. And while our guidance for '25 now is between 12.3% and 12.4%. As we're looking at 2026, we're focused on building a plan that really positions us to deliver against our long-term targets.

We're still in the planning process, and we need to see where 2025 lands because we still have the rest of this quarter to go. But reflecting on our commitment that 2026 will not be another big heavy investment year. We would not expect EBIT margin next year to deteriorate from 2025 levels. Now you asked also about the long-term plan. While our performance is better than what we had planned, it's still premature to change our long-term growth targets at this time.

We're confident that we can deliver our targets over time, but there are so much nuances that can happen from year-to-year. My focus as a leader is to make sure that we're building a plan that we can continue to invest in this business, remain relevant and take share. And as you know, we have a brand-new CFO starting tomorrow.

And as he gets into the operations, I'm sure he's going to have a perspective, too. He and I are going to work together along with the Board to make sure that we have a long-term plan that really supports our business and taking market share and being a profitable business over time. So bottom line, I would say that you should not look for EBIT margins to deteriorate from fiscal year 2025 levels.

Your next question will come from Michael Lasser with UBS.

Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Kecia, there's been some debate around the start of the holiday season. Ulta has carried a lot of momentum over the last 6 months. Are you finding that some of the momentum is starting to fade where consumers are shopping more around events and in between those periods, they're a little quieter. And does that give you pause about the need to continue to make investments in order to drive the business?

Kecia Steelman
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Michael, for the question. What I would say is that comp growth during the quarter was really consistent across all periods. And as I shared, we were pleased with Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Beauty is still a very important category for the consumer in their lives and also for shopping for their holiday needs. And Ulta Beauty is also very important to them.

I'm confident in our plans and staying really focused on execution. And we're having a lot of fun. We're working really hard on this plan. The team is having a good time doing it. We've got momentum on our side. I like what I'm seeing in the newness pipeline. I just -- I think we're going to continue to play our game and continue to stay focused at keeping the consumer at the center of everything that we're doing. And I just don't necessarily see that momentum changing anytime soon.

Your next question will come from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.

Irwin Boruchow
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just I wanted to ask about the shrink benefits that you guys have seen all year. Any chance you could quantify it for the third quarter? Are you expecting benefits into the fourth quarter? And then I guess, is that -- is there more tailwind to that? Or is this -- was this a big kind of catch-up year for you guys? I know 2 years ago, there were some issues, you've clearly worked through. So just kind of looking for more clarity there.

Chris Lialios
Senior VP, Interim CFO & Controller

Thanks for the question, Ike. We are pleased with the progress, obviously, as we stated in our prepared remarks that we've made to reduce shrink. In Q3, there was a modest improvement. And in Q4, we expect another modest improvement in shrink. And we do expect for the full year '25 that shrink will be lower than '24. We believe there's still some opportunity to reduce shrink further, but the teams are working very hard, and we're very pleased with all the initiatives that we've put in place.

Your next question will come from Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson.

Michael Baker
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Could you discuss the competitive situation? Amazon Premium Beauty still seems to be grown a lot. I think Sephora at Kohl's actually comped negative, yet LVMH's selective retail was positive. A lot of different moving parts from your competitors. How do you see the competitive situation today versus 3 months ago or earlier in the year?

Kecia Steelman
President, CEO & Director

Thank you for the question, Mike. Beauty has always been a competitive category. And there's been consistent growth, and it's been combined with attractive profit margins, there is a -- it's attracted a variety of players into the category. But that's what our Ulta Beauty Unleashed plan is designed to do is to really accelerate and amplify our differentiation and what makes us unique.

I will just say that we're doubling down on the drivers that we know with us having 46.3 million loyalty members, we know what our consumers are purchasing, how they're purchasing. We have, like I said, the pipeline of newness. Our merchants are doing a fantastic job of listening to the consumer and what it is that they're looking for. We are the only one that really offers everything from low to lux and everything in between, underpinned with the services and activations and the investments that we're making in our eventing.

So the experiential shopping makes us different. When you look at our e-commerce business, and you see like one of the big drivers in e-com is BOPIS. It further substantiates that our e-com business strength is there, but they still like coming into the store. So I do think that while, yes, it's a very competitive environment, we are uniquely positioned to continue to win and take share in the industry. So like I said, I feel really great about our plans. The plans are working. We're still in the early phases of them, and they're just going to continue to -- the momentum is going to continue to be on our side.

Your next question will come from Dana Telsey with Telsey Group.

Dana Telsey
Telsey Advisory Group LLC

Congratulations on the nice results. Kecia, as you think of top line and you think of the categories and prestige and mass, what are you seeing on prestige and mass? Is there a difference? And as you go forward through this holiday season, is the newness at all different this holiday season than it was last year or any way you're triangulating it? And lastly, you mentioned on Space NK bringing things here. What are you bringing? Has it been tested? How is it reacting? How do you see that moving forward?

Kecia Steelman
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Dana. I think that might have been a 3-part question. I'll try to make sure I cover all of the points. But in regard to market share, prestige beauty, the industry grew in mid-single digits, and we gained share primarily driven by our strength in skin and fragrance, but makeup also increased. We're seeing steady improvements in prestige haircare in our trends.

And what's great about prestige is that we gained share in both brick-and-mortar and digital channels with elevated competition even out there. And then in mass, mass grew as an industry mid-single digits in Q3, and we gained share primarily driven by strength in mass makeup. So what I'd say is that I'm really encouraged to see that our plans are working to improve our performance and really drive market share. And we're -- our efforts are gaining traction. We're confident in our go-forward plans.

And market share is a battle, but we're staying focused on building on our successes to continue to drive sustained market share improvements over the long haul. You asked a little bit about Space NK. And what I would say is that with Space NK, it's still early. We're in the early innings. But one of the things that was really attractive to us is the nuance of their ability to really have clienteling and really have close relationships with their consumer, be really agile.

They've just now launched their app themselves. It's just -- like I said, I think this is a situation where 1 plus 1 can equal 3. They've figured out how to do High Street really well in smaller box locations and be really efficient with their space. I think what we can bring to them is back-office operations and how do you continue to leverage the size and the scale and the operational efficiencies that we have.

So it's really early, still in the innings is what I would say. But we have the ability to really learn a lot from each other. I want to protect what makes Space NK unique. I do not want to turn Space NK into a mini Ulta Beauty. I think that's what's made Space NK so special. But I think like I said, there's learnings that we can share from them and to us and us and to them that will help us both be better in the long run.

Your next question will come from Michael Binetti with Evercore.

Michael Binetti
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Let me add my congrats. Great quarter. I'm still trying to get my head around the SG&A and how we got from 13% to 14% growth for the year on the last call to 23% in the third quarter. And I think if grosses are flat, backs into 15% to 16% growth for the year now. I know you called out a couple of items within the 23% growth in the third quarter, but I don't understand if those were included in the 13% to 14% for the year previously or not.

Just maybe help us understand the bridge there. And then I know you have talked a lot about SG&A a lot and the 12% margin, EBITDA margin. But the gross margin flat for the year on a 4% to 5% comp, I was trying to think through that a little bit and think what the comp leverage point is that you guys are comfortable with there. I think the last publicly available documents, we saw Space NK had a gross margin profile closer to 43% for a couple of years in a row, pretty stable, so 3 or 4 points higher than where you're at. Does that kind of a comp in the model lever SG&A in a normalized environment once we get past some of the Space NK impact?

Chris Lialios
Senior VP, Interim CFO & Controller

Thanks for the question, Michael. It seems like there was one question there. So we'll try to tackle them here. As far as Space NK, so Space NK does not become comp until Q3 of next year. So you will have some Space NK impact year-over-year in the first half of 2026. As far as the deleverage, FY '25, we expect gross margin will be roughly flat, again, driven by lower shrink and higher merchandise margin, offset by the deleverage of other revenue and store occupancy costs as well as the adverse channel mix that we talked about.

For the fourth quarter, we expect GM deleverage driven primarily by store fixed and other revenue as well, largely reflecting our fourth quarter comp expectation and the adverse channel mix, again, still plays into effect there in Q4, offset by -- we will see some leverage in our supply chain costs.

Your next question will come from Adrienne Yih with Barclays.

Adrienne Yih-Tennant
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Let me add my congratulations. The stores look fantastic, I have seen one this afternoon. Kecia, can you talk about the Target 1,800 number of stores. At the Analyst Day, it was a couple of hundred more from the October 24 kind of anchor. And your top line is 2x the sale, the rate of category growth.

Next year, we're going to shed over 600 of the Target ex Ulta. So I'm just wondering, is there -- how do you feel about the pace? And has anything changed there? And then for Chris, a question just on kind of the modeling of the kind of pricing with the price benefit that you had and the tariff inventory hitting the income statement, should we expect more of a parity, a matching effect on the pricing actions versus the tariff impact actions starting in maybe 1Q or 2Q?

Kecia Steelman
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Adrienne, for the question. And I'm happy that you are in our stores and hopefully, you're shopping. I would say that we -- our long-term algorithm of what we've shared for new stores is we've said 1,800, and we're still confident with that 1,800 store count going forward. And then, Chris, I'll kick it over to you.

Chris Lialios
Senior VP, Interim CFO & Controller

So on the pricing impact, obviously, we'll talk more about the impact of price increases in Q1 and Q2 next year in March. But as far as the price increase in Q4, we do expect to see price increases, modest price increases like we've seen in other years.

Adrienne Yih-Tennant
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And the tariff, the inventory will not yet fully be expressed with the pressure. Is that correct? So it's similar to the third quarter in terms of a net benefit?

Chris Lialios
Senior VP, Interim CFO & Controller

Yes. As you know, it's based on our inventory valuation method, the average cost. So it's going to take a while for it to reach the new cost level. But most likely, it takes about 1 or 2 quarters for it to flush through.

Your next question will come from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.

Simeon Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Can I take your temperature on newness? I think it's been a theme for '25. What are you seeing as it wraps into next year? And if you're able to separate this year has been a lot of improvement. Some of it's newness, some of it's marketing. And then you've talked a lot about early innings of some things sound like basic things that you brought like the payment thing. So can you talk about how much internal improvement you would chalk this year up to and how much more is to go in the future?

Kecia Steelman
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Simeon, for the question. I feel really good about the newness pipeline that I'm seeing for 2026. The merchants have been hard at work developing plans, and that's one of the rigors that Lauren has really brought, I think, into the company is taking a look at the current year and building a plan like how we're going to combat newness that's going to be flowing next year and being really balanced across the portfolio.

So in regard to newness, I feel good about what next year looks like. The second part of your question was, I mentioned early innings and that there's some things that I think can continue to come play. What I mean by that is this has been a heavy, heavy investment year in a lot of our technology, investments in our teams. And there's benefits to letting things marinate a bit. And we've been coming off of 2, what I call really high -- or a few high years of investment in our foundation.

So for the last 3 years before this last year, we were investing in our ERP, our POS, supply chain, back-end operations, digital, I mean, all -- pretty much all aspects of the business. And then we had fallen behind in our go-to-market. So that's what happened this year as we shifted more into the go-to-market type strategies. And so we've been -- it's been a heavy up investment year in more guest-facing, sales driving, market-driving initiatives.

There is going to be benefit to being, I would say, hyper prioritized next year. We always are going to want to invest in the business, but we're going to be more prioritized next year. There's going to be less investments next year, very thoughtfully done. And we need to see the benefits from some of these investments that we've made over the last few years, really kind of settle in, marinate and get the benefit from them. So that's why I'm saying that I feel like we're still in the early innings is that there's major opportunity for us to continue to see these things come to play.

Your final question will come from Olivia Tong with Raymond James.

Olivia Tong Cheang
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. Your early read from Black Friday through Cyber Monday sounded promising. So just wondering if you could unpack the expectations for a deceleration to 2.5% to 3.5% comp. Was there any impact from the government shutdown? Any change in consumer habits with pricing? And if you could, what quarter-to-date looked like?

And then just thinking about the initiatives going forward, you're going into next year with a ton of momentum, it seems. But curious how you think about some of these initiatives for next year to come some pretty amazing top line growth this year. You already talked about the newness. But what about next 12 months versus last 12 months in international wellness marketplace, other new initiatives and the ability to continue to build those so that the contribution continues to get bigger as you comp these numbers?

Kecia Steelman
President, CEO & Director

Yes. As I mentioned -- thanks, Olivia, for the question. As I mentioned, Black Friday and Cyber Monday performance, we were really pleased with. And what I'm excited about is that we came out of a really strong business with even stronger in-stocks than we've seen ever coming into out of a holiday -- peak holiday weekend. While this is a challenging, this is also a very fun time, but these next 9 weeks are big weeks.

And there's just so much volatility that can happen. You can have bad weather that happens on a key critical weekend. Who knows what could happen between now and the end of the quarter. So I think we're just being very prudent in our guidance and making sure that I kind of like the plan of not missing a quarter as a new CFO, first year in position. So I'm wanting to put something out there that I feel like is an achievable plan and one that the team can continue to work towards.

In regard to your question around long term and how confident am I in that we can continue to sustain momentum. I believe that we are a company that can continue to grow share, and that's what our plan that we've built is built to do. I look forward to sharing more with you in March after we finish the year, and we can share what our plans are for next year. But the team has been working really hard along with myself to build a good game plan for what 2026 looks like. Like I said, we're in the early phases of that. We're looking forward to being able to share that with you all.

But we've got good fundamentals in place. I grew up through operations. I understand the levers that it takes to really drive a profitable retail business, and I'm committed to doing that. All right. Well, thank you all for joining us today and discussing our third quarter results.

We're excited about the progress we're making against our Ulta Beauty Unleashed Strategy and focus on closing out the year strong. We appreciate your continued interest in Ulta Beauty and hope you all have a safe and happy holiday season. We look forward to speaking to you all again in March when we report our fourth quarter and full year results. Have a great evening, everyone.
