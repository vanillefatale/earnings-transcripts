Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question today is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI.

Stephen Kim
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Actually, quite impressive here given the headwinds. So congratulations to you guys. I wanted to ask you about your SG&A, if I could. I think that it was probably a little higher, my guess is, than you expected. And I was curious, you attributed the higher level primarily due to lower closings year-over-year, but your closings didn't miss your expectations or your guide. And so -- and actually, it beat.

So I was kind of curious, did the SG&A sort of surprise you? And was there anything else other than the fact that you had some lower closings, just given the fact that it didn't really sort of square with how your closings came in? And particularly within that, could you -- is there anything in the way of incentives or something that is showing up in SG&A?

Bill Wheat
Executive VP & CFO

Steve, nothing unusual in SG&A this quarter. Overall, relatively in line with our plan, and we hit our operating margin guidance for the quarter. If you look at the overall spend on SG&A, it was down slightly year-over-year in terms of absolute dollars. And as we look at our platform and we look at what we're planning to do this year, we're planning on growing our closings.

Our guide is to grow our closings for the year. And so we're maintaining our platform in place, but our first quarter closings were down. And just we get less leverage on our SG&A when we have fewer closings during the quarter. But our expectation is for the year is we would not continue to see this kind of increase as a percentage of revenues over the course of the entire year.

Stephen Kim
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

So just to clarify, you're saying your guide for the year is for SG&A to be kind of flattish on a year-over-year basis as a percentage of revenues. Is that what you're saying?

Bill Wheat
Executive VP & CFO

We don't guide any of our margins or expense ratios over the course of an entire year. We just guide one quarter out. We're guiding our operating margin for Q2 and our gross margin for Q2 and then, obviously, our volume for the entire year.

Stephen Kim
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got you. Okay. And then, I guess, you've also talked about your capital allocation and your -- sorry, and specifically, you reiterated your guide for cash flow. And I was curious if you -- I think in the past, you had talked about cash flow -- targeting a cash flow conversion of about 100%. Can you talk about how that progression is going and whether or not that's still a reasonable expectation in the foreseeable future?

Bill Wheat
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, that's still a reasonable expectation. We're still guiding. We reiterated our guide to have cash flow -- consolidated cash flow greater than $3 billion. We're -- I think we're tracking right in line with expectations.

The next question will be from John Lovallo from UBS.

John Lovallo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Pretty strong community count growth in the first quarter of about 12% year-over-year on average. How are you guys thinking about kind of the cadence of community count growth as we move through the year?

Paul Romanowski
President, CEO & Director

John, the community count is up. It was up 12% and 2%, I think, sequentially. And we still think we're going to see that community count continue to stay at a higher level, but we do expect it to drift down more towards mid-single to high single-digit range. We're pleased to have the community count out there today as we've seen absorption across the market, not seeing as much absorption per flag. So having the additional communities allows us to maintain our guide and still feel comfortable with where we're positioned today as we see the spring season unfold.

John Lovallo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Understood. And then if we walk from the fourth quarter gross margin of 20%, excluding the inventory reserve or the warranty -- I'm sorry, the warranty reserve benefit, what are sort of the moving pieces there? I know, Jessica, you mentioned that incentives kind of stepped up as you moved through the quarter. But how are you thinking maybe about land, labor and materials on a sequential basis?

Jessica Hansen
Senior VP of Communications & People and Head of Investor Relations

Sure. First, John, just as a reminder, in Q4, we also had an unusual item flowing through our warranty and litigation costs. We had 60 basis points of greater than typical litigation costs last quarter. This quarter, we had the opposite direction, a 40 basis point benefit from those warranty costs.

So kind of on an apples-to-apples basis, our fourth quarter gross margin was 20.6%. Our Q1 gross margin is 20.0%. And then our guide for the quarter is 19% to 19.5% in Q2. So at the midpoint, we're estimating to be down roughly 75 basis points quarter-over-quarter. The guide really reflects what we've been seeing, which is our stick and brick costs relatively flat sequentially and slightly down year-over-year, which is what we really posted this year -- this quarter as well.

We expect our lot cost to continue to be up sequentially and on a year-over-year basis based on what we currently see in our lot pipeline. And then as I did say on the call, we had to use a higher level of incentives as we moved throughout the quarter. So the guide really, most importantly, incorporates the most recent market conditions we've seen and our backlog margin coming out of the quarter at the end of December.

Operator

The next question will be from Matthew Bouley from Barclays.

Matthew Bouley
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I wanted to stick on the incentive topic. If I'm hearing you correctly, I mean, it sounds like that Q2 guide is reflecting of your increase in incentives over the past quarter in terms of what you're selling. So obviously, we've had this move lower in mortgage rates over the past several months, over the past couple of weeks, et cetera.

I mean does the move lower in rates at a certain point either support that kind of cost of incentives for you guys? Or are you able to kind of do anything creatively around arms or temporary buydowns, et cetera, in this backdrop? Just kind of any visibility to where you might see that incentive sort of peaking out at some point?

Michael Murray
Executive VP & COO

The cost of the incentives that came through in the first quarter were largely resulted from interest rate locks provided when rates were slightly higher, therefore, at a higher cost. We accelerated the use of those incentives throughout the quarter and the exiting incentive levels in December are heavily coloring our margin outlook for the second quarter. If rates continue to compress and stay compressed, we would expect to see a slight decrease in the cost of providing those incentives, but that's not yet factored into any of our guidance.

Matthew Bouley
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Perfect. And secondly, maybe just sticking on this topic of lower rates. I know we can't always read too much into the first three weeks of the calendar year. But just any color on sort of the cadence of demand, traffic and sales maybe through the quarter? And then since you have gotten this move lower in rates in recent weeks, is there just any kind of signals you can take from the past couple of weekends on how buyers are responding to that?

Paul Romanowski
President, CEO & Director

Matt, I would say through the quarter, relatively consistent with what we would expect to see seasonally, entering into that quarter and being one of the lower quarters in terms of overall demand as we enter into the spring and the first two weeks, really too early to tell what we're going to see as far as trajectory into the spring. But when we see those kind of rates -- moves in rates and hovering right around 6%, it does spur some activity in our sales offices. And I think today, we feel good about our position in terms of our inventory, our community count and the level of sales we've seen through the first quarter and into the first couple of weeks here of the second quarter to reaffirm our guidance for the year.

The next question will be from Alan Ratner from Zelman.

Alan Ratner
Zelman & Associates LLC

Obviously, there's a lot of focus on the policy side, and I'm sure we'll hear some more from President Trump this week on that front. But I guess, first off, in terms of what has been announced so far or at least floated out there, with specific regard to your rental business, I'm curious how you're thinking about that in the context of the proposed ban on institutional buyers purchasing single-family homes.

I know you guys have been kind of reducing investment in rental in general, but how are you thinking about managing that business investment there, building out communities with the uncertainty hanging over that part of the business?

Paul Romanowski
President, CEO & Director

Alan, our focus on SFR rental has largely been and continues to be on purpose-built communities and believe that, that's a good place for us to continue to stay focused. We don't sell many homes to institutional buyers in our for-sale communities. So for us, really not much competition for those people that are coming in to buy a home, looking for a home and whether it's first-time move-up or any one of our segments. We think we'll continue to stay focused there.

And with our SFR business has shifted more from a full build, lease and then sell fully stabilized asset to more of a forward sale scenario. So I feel really good about the position of our single-family rental business, and we'll see how all of this plays out over time, but feel good about our position there.

Alan Ratner
Zelman & Associates LLC

Okay. I appreciate that. Obviously, we'll see whether there's any type of exclusion or carve-out for those purpose-built communities. I think, obviously, there's a good argument for that to be the case. But shifting gears a little bit in terms of the land market. I'm curious if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the land front in terms of have costs started to come down at all in the land market? Are you seeing more of a bid-ask spread widening and kind of a slowdown in overall activity, development cost inflation? Any color you can give there because, obviously, I think that's going to be a necessary component towards rebuilding the industry's gross margin is to see some relief on land costs and development inflation.

Michael Murray
Executive VP & COO

I don't think we've seen significant capitulation in the land, the raw land market itself. I think the sellers there are fairly patient. We have seen probably some progress on some of the development cost aspects as activity levels have slowed. And further, we've seen some improved terms, not a tremendous amount of price discounts or any distressed opportunities, but rational conversations with our land development partners about meeting the market together and working through communities at acceptable paces.

So we've seen some adjustment in pacing, which has been very helpful. But we haven't seen any broad default of deals or new deals coming -- the deals coming back to the market over and over again with distressed sellers.

The next question will be from Ryan Gilbert from BTIG.

Ryan Gilbert
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

I just wanted to go back on, I guess, the year-to-date demand trends. Paul, it sounded like you said that when rates get to around 6%, you see a pickup in the sales offices. Has that been the case so far in January? Have you seen a pickup in homebuyer demand given the drop in rates?

Paul Romanowski
President, CEO & Director

We've been pleased with what we've seen so far. Again, it's early, very early in the spring selling season, and we'll see how that plays out over time, but we feel good about our positioning. And any time you see the rates move across a threshold like that, it certainly creates more activity in our sales offices.

Ryan Gilbert
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then on the supply side, it looked like maybe there was a step down in industry-wide housing starts. And I think we're seeing some move lower in resale inventory as well. Are there any markets where you're seeing any benefit from less inventory coming online or maybe supply or home construction dropping that could potentially help margins going forward?

Paul Romanowski
President, CEO & Director

I don't think there's any specific markets I can speak to where we've seen any significant shift in supply. I do believe that it's been a pretty rational approach to the market in terms of starts for us and across the industry. We feel good about our inventory position. We -- our starts slightly exceeded our sales this quarter. We do expect our starts to be more in the second quarter than in our first.

And what we watch closely is the number of completed homes that we have, and that is down a couple of thousand units sequentially this quarter over last. So I feel good about our positioning, the amount of supply we have in the markets and have the homes we need to meet demand in the spring selling season.

Operator

The next question will be from Sam Reid from Wells Fargo.

Richard Reid
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to just do a quick postmortem on the warranty cost piece of gross margin and that reversal you called out in the first quarter. First of all, were you expecting to get a reversal there? And then second, is there any warranty noise we should be contemplating in the second quarter guide? And then perhaps just want to talk to kind of what should we be thinking about for warranty costs within gross margins on a go-forward basis?

Jessica Hansen
Senior VP of Communications & People and Head of Investor Relations

Sure, Sam. The warranty recovery was something we've been working on for a period of time to recoup some costs that we've had to incur that you'll see when we file our 10-Q were predominantly in our San Antonio market in the South Central region. So we were pleased to get that settlement in and be able to net that against the warranty costs that we incurred during the quarter.

We also did see just a slightly overall level -- slightly lower level of warranty and litigation costs incurred this quarter than are typical. And you layer that into also the litigation cost last quarter, and you see a big swing in the warranty and litigation cost line item in our gross margin supplemental detail that we provide, that was actually a 20 basis point benefit. We would expect going forward that to be more normal. And if you go and look at prior quarters outside of the last two, it's call it, anywhere from 30 to 60 basis points that we net against our gross home sales gross margin for warranty and litigation costs. And we don't know of anything at this time that would make that be different in the go-forward quarters. The last two quarters have just been unusual in terms of what's happened.

Richard Reid
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

That helps, Jessica. And then switching gears here. One of your big competitors is stepping up the use of ARMs. Can you just remind us your mix of ARMs and where that sits relative to last quarter and last year? And then if there is any change in your ARM cadence, any implications for financial services margins that we should be cognizant of?

Paul Romanowski
President, CEO & Director

Our use of ARMs is in the low single digit as a percent of homes financed through our mortgage company. And although we've seen some more attractive ARM products that for us, if they can be utilized for long-term approval, meaning that they're a longer-term ARM, then we've seen some, but it hasn't stepped up much. Still the incentive used most when we talk about rates is for our buyers and through our mortgage company is a 30-year fixed rate.

Jessica Hansen
Senior VP of Communications & People and Head of Investor Relations

Yes. So when Paul says low single digit on ARMs, that's just an absolute ARM product that is their product. If you look at the rate buydowns we're utilizing, we did see a tick up in temporary buydowns that we layered in on top of the permanent. That was more like a low double-digit percentage this quarter, but that's been running anywhere from a mid- to high single-digit percentage.

The next question will be from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.

Eric Bosshard
Cleveland Research Company LLC

The comments you've made about affordability, I'm just curious, obviously, there's some hope for some external solution to affordability. But absent that, the steps that you're looking at to address affordability, what you're doing with incentives is having some effect. But are there any structural things you're evaluating or taking in regards to house size or house construct or location or even markets that you're considering related to this ongoing affordability issue?

Paul Romanowski
President, CEO & Director

Eric, we focus every day on meeting the homeowners where they need to be, especially on a monthly payment. And for us, and in today's market, the reality of home pricing and cost of materials and cost of land is that we have seen continued introduction of smaller homes, whether that's a plan or two inside of an existing community or a whole community focused at more affordable price points.

For us, the biggest limiter to some of that and creating more of that tends to be lot size and minimum lot size requirements at the municipal level where we can achieve that and get to a little higher density with more efficiency and provide a house that meets the monthly payment needs, especially of our first-time homebuyers, we see success there. And so we have focused on that across markets. And I wouldn't say there's any particular area where we're seeing that more, maybe other than those municipalities that are a little more flexible and allow us to go meet the market where it wants to be met.

Eric Bosshard
Cleveland Research Company LLC

Okay. And then secondly, if I could, the first-time market -- first-time customer is about 2/3 of the business. I'm curious, is the other 1/3 of the business behaving similarly to that 2/3 to the first time? Or is there some difference in performance, price sensitivity, traffic volume, anything that's notably different?

Paul Romanowski
President, CEO & Director

I wouldn't say anything notably different. There's a lot of macro discussion going on, which I think impacts buyer sentiment in the market, and we've seen some consistency across that. Certainly, as you move up the price curve and there's less sensitivity to rates that, that move-up homebuyer can move with a little more consistency when they want to and as they want to. So -- but I would say, overall, I haven't seen a specific trend which shows a big separation of what's happening in our first-time homebuyer market compared to our move-up.

Operator

The next question will be from Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup.

Anthony Pettinari
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

As you think about '26, do you expect to continue to outgrow the market? Or maybe could you be more in line with the market? Or are there regions where you're willing to let go a little share to maintain margin? And then just in terms of your spec count down year-over-year, is that just reflecting expectation for just kind of maybe a tougher spring season versus last year?

Michael Murray
Executive VP & COO

I think in terms of looking at our growth expectations relative to the market, we are expecting to grow this year. We have certainly positioned for growth with the increase in markets served over the past few years as well as significant increase in community counts being up 12% year-over-year. But we take that community by community and market by market, looking to maximize the returns there. And where we can aggregate market share profitably, we'll continue to do so, as we've done through the company's history.

And the second part of your question?

Jessica Hansen
Senior VP of Communications & People and Head of Investor Relations

Specs decline.

Michael Murray
Executive VP & COO

It was on the specs decline. The spec decline is something that we've been focused on with compressing our building times and our cycle times that we're able to be more efficient with the capital deployed in a given neighborhood and more responsive to more immediate buyer demands when they walk in. So the spec count reduction has been deliberate and purposeful, and it's not a limiter necessarily on our growth, as it has been in the past, because we can build homes faster than we ever have been able to.

Anthony Pettinari
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's very helpful. And then just following up on kind of the policy. We talked about, I think, a few proposals, but I'm just curious what policies you think could be most helpful or impactful in terms of improving housing activity and getting more folks in homes in kind of a sustainable way.

Paul Romanowski
President, CEO & Director

Anthony, we're pleased that the administration acknowledges housing affordability as an issue and that there's a lot of focus on that from a lot of folks and think that it needs to be a focus. There's lots of different things that could be done on both the supply and the demand side. But ultimately, consumers feeling good about where they are today, seeing the resale market open up, seeing availability at the local level, willingness for us to go drive more affordable housing into the market. All of those things, I think, would be helpful, and we'll see how all of this plays out over time.

Jessica Hansen
Senior VP of Communications & People and Head of Investor Relations

And we're already doing more to address affordability, I'd say, than any other builder out there. And we'll see what ultimately comes out of the policy, but we believe we're the best positioned builder to take advantage of if there is any sort of demand pickup out there, particularly for the first-time homebuyer.

Operator

The next question will be from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.

Michael Rehaut
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

First, I wanted to focus on -- there was recent tweets, I guess, or comments made by the FHFA director directly speaking to share repurchases by large homebuilders in contrast to putting out more volume into the market. So I wanted your thoughts on that.

Obviously, today, you reiterated your outlook for $2.5 billion of share repurchases for the year. I'm curious if you've had any direct conversations with the FHFA regarding this because, obviously, you guys are mandated by all public companies, you have an obligation to your shareholders, first and foremost. And so I'm just curious if there's been any discussions with the FHFA and your thoughts on those recent comments.

Paul Romanowski
President, CEO & Director

Michael, we have maintained our balanced approach. And you look at our starts pace this quarter sequentially, up 27%, as Jessica intimated, providing affordable housing to more Americans today. I think 64% of the homes financed through our mortgage company were first-time homebuyers and closings this quarter.

We feel very good about our position to continue to meet that demand and provide the housing that we need out there. No direct conversations for us around buybacks and feel like a balanced approach, and that's why we reiterated what we plan to do on our guidance for the year. I feel like we're in a great position to continue to provide the housing that we need to with the cash flow that we're generating to both invest in our operations and our business and to provide returns and return money to our shareholders.

Michael Rehaut
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. All right. Appreciate that. I guess, secondly, you kind of highlighted earlier in the call that your incentives went up during the first quarter, and that's -- appears to be the primary driver of the sequential decline in gross margins in the second quarter, among other factors, I guess. I wanted to get a sense, as a percent of sales, where incentives ended the first quarter versus the beginning of the first quarter? And if that shift occurred towards the end of the quarter or was it kind of ratable throughout?

Bill Wheat
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Mike, the increase in incentives was really ratable throughout the quarter, sequentially increased throughout the quarter. And so we exited the quarter at a higher level of incentives and a lower gross margin on our closings in December than for the overall quarter. And so that's really the level that we carry into Q2. And so that's a big part of the driver of our guide for our Q2 margin.

Jessica Hansen
Senior VP of Communications & People and Head of Investor Relations

And pleased that incentives are still having the desired impact, right? Our sales were up 3% year-over-year as a result of those efforts.

Michael Rehaut
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Right. And can you just remind us as to what percent of sales incentives were by the end of the quarter versus the beginning of the quarter?

Jessica Hansen
Senior VP of Communications & People and Head of Investor Relations

We've been running a high single-digit percentage. Today, we might have ticked up to low double digits.

The next question will be from Trevor Allinson from Wolfe Research.

Trevor Allinson
Wolfe Research, LLC

A follow-up question on your view on current new home inventory levels in your markets. I appreciate it varies market by market. But if we were to focus on some of the more important geographies in Florida, Texas and some of the other more important markets, is there still excess inventory relative to demand? Or has the slowdown in starts we've seen across the industry here in the fourth quarter brought that more into equilibrium?

Paul Romanowski
President, CEO & Director

I would say we still see pockets of elevated inventory, and that is market to market. I don't think we're here today to call out anything with specificity as to where we're significantly overweighted in inventory. But certainly, market by market and submarkets inside of larger MSAs, and there are subdivisions and communities out there where demand hasn't caught up with the amount of supply that's in the market, but we see that continue to rightsize across our footprint.

Trevor Allinson
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Paul, that's very helpful. And then second, obviously, there's been a lot of activity on the policy side here. There's an expectation for a lot of activity. Rates have come down here. If those are successful in driving better demand this spring, how do you guys think about your preference to do more volume versus the 86,000 to 88,000 closings target you have currently versus recapturing some margin as incentives still remain really elevated?

Michael Murray
Executive VP & COO

Trevor, we're going to take a look at that community by community. And as always, we're going to look to focus on driving the best return out of that given community based upon competitive dynamics at that submarket level, replacement lot supply and what our demand trends are there. And where there is opportunity for margin expansion, we'll take it. Where it makes more sense to drive more pace, we'll do that as well. Looking for a balanced approach, no different than what we've been doing. It's just responding to the current market conditions in place in front of us sales office by sales office.

Operator

The next question will be from Rafe Jadrosich from Bank of America.

Rafe Jadrosich
BofA Securities, Research Division

As we head into spring selling, can you compare the market today versus, say, a year ago in terms of the demand and inventory that's out there?

Paul Romanowski
President, CEO & Director

I don't know that there's a direct parallel to be drawn. We are encouraged by the fact that we've still got people out there looking to buy a home. There's certainly not a lack of interest. I think it's breaking through the consumer confidence and seeing people feel good about their decision to move forward. We are encouraged by the traffic we see out there today. I do believe that if you look at today over last year at this time, there's a little more balance of inventory. Certainly, we see that across our communities, and I think you see that across the industry.

So setup, we believe we are in a good position as we move into the spring selling season. Comfortable with where we're positioned with our communities, our community count, our inventory and most importantly, our people in the field, taking care of the buyers as they come into our models.

Rafe Jadrosich
BofA Securities, Research Division

And then on the stick and brick side, I think you said that in the fiscal first quarter, stick and brick costs were down 1% quarter-over-quarter. And I think you're guiding for it to be flattish quarter-over-quarter in the second quarter. Is it flattening out now? Or is there still opportunity to take more cost out? Where are you in the process of sort of clawing back some margin from either the trades or building product or distributors?

Paul Romanowski
President, CEO & Director

We believe there's still opportunity there. And our reduction in starts was intentional to give us the opportunity to meet with our trades or vendors or suppliers and look at the reality of the market in front of us. So although our guide is too flat and not seeing significant reduction in stick and brick, part of that, too, is it's a percent of -- or it's based on a square foot basis, which is a little harder sometimes to measure based on mix and product and sizing. But we certainly feel like there's opportunity to continue to see some reductions in the cost of homes that we're putting in the ground.

The next question will be from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs.

Susan Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

My first question is thinking about the conditions that you've talked to and your ability to continue to hold on to that improvement that you've seen in cycle times and the efforts that you're realizing with your suppliers, if we do see somewhat of a lift in demand as we go through this year, do you think you can continue to maintain that flexibility that you've realized?

Michael Murray
Executive VP & COO

We've had long relationships with these trade partners. The last time we had a really significant production disruption was partially labor, largely it was due to material shortages. That is something we do not expect at all this time at all.

Materials are in great shape. Product is available. And the relationships we've had with labor trades in several markets going back 30 and 40 years, consistently paying the bills on time, consistent starts cadence and a consistency of product deployed has been really helpful in maintaining our partnership with those trade bases.

Susan Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then maybe turning to the growth side of things. Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of some of the smaller privates, how they're feeling today and your ability to perhaps leverage further M&A as an element of growth that you're looking to achieve?

Paul Romanowski
President, CEO & Director

We continue to look at opportunities that are in the market. And I think that our focus has been more on the tuck-in opportunities to either expand our capacity in a particular market and/or an entry into a market. But we continue to evaluate those as they come towards us. And I think if you see anything in the future, it will be similar to what you've seen over the last several years with the smaller builders that give us a solid platform and are a good fit to us in markets.

Operator

The next question will be from Ken Zener from Seaport Research.

Kenneth Zener
Seaport Research Partners

Paul, with the orders up 3%, there's a community count effect there, but a lot of details asked today. My basic question is this. Demand is there, you need to offer some incentives, but demand is there amid very low job growth. For example, Dallas, you're familiar with, job growth of around 30,000 year-over-year. It's well less than half the long-term rate, yet you're still seeing demand.

Can you talk to like where that demand is coming from amid such low job growth that we're seeing? It's not just Dallas. It's in many different markets, yet you guys are still seeing activity. Is that -- do we really need job growth to normalize to get your margins in a more stable upward slope?

Paul Romanowski
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think job growth is always going to be key to overall household formation and the demand side of our business. There's no question there. I do believe that we are seeing -- continue to see some pent-up demand. And as people grow and especially for our buyers for the first-time homebuyer that have delayed that home purchase decision and making the decision today to come out of an apartment and/or out of their parents' home makes it a little less reliant on seeing just pure job growth to create household formation in some of the MSAs that we operate in. So I do think it's a balance. I think long term, we absolutely need to see job growth and continued job growth if we want to see growth in overall housing demand.

Kenneth Zener
Seaport Research Partners

Right. And can you kind of comment that -- I mean it's AI and many different things today, the 10-year is up 5 or 6 basis points again. But do you feel like we're really pulling forward just from that "pent-up" demand that didn't occur? Because it's quite odd that we're seeing demand so strong when job growth has been so weak.

And it begs the question of, right, what if it stays weak? Do you pull -- have you tapped essentially your demand that was there, not tied to job growth? I'm just trying to figure it out because [ like do you know ] what -- what do your people say when you don't have really good job growth, yet housing demand is there?

Jessica Hansen
Senior VP of Communications & People and Head of Investor Relations

Well, I think it's why we continue to prefer our focus on the entry-level and first-time buyer because they're a need-based buyer. Everyone needs a place to live. And so if we can strike that right affordability balance, they might need a little bit of help in terms of gift funds from parents or relative.

We continue to see just shy of 20% of our buyers utilizing our mortgage company are utilizing gift funds to make that purchase. But the lower the price point we can put houses on the ground at, the more buyers that are out there because once again, a first-time buyer needs a place to live. If we can be competitive with rents, they're still interested in that home purchase.

The next question will be from Jade Rahmani from KBW.

If rates do move lower, do you think homebuilders will choose to pass along that saving to buyers rather than take margins in the hopes that, that would stimulate demand further?

Michael Murray
Executive VP & COO

I think we continue to see a balance to meet the consumer where they are relative to the rate environment. And it would be a -- can you spur additional demand and drive more pace, more units? If that's going to be the most incrementally positive lever we can pull on returns, then we would go that direction. If it's a community where there's more scarcity of supply, it might result in an improvement in margins.

Jessica Hansen
Senior VP of Communications & People and Head of Investor Relations

Even with our increased incentives in the December quarter, we kept our lowest 30-year fixed rate offering at 3.99% and so we would have the ability, to Mike's point, we could always choose to go lower if rates move lower and it could cost us the same or if demand is just picking up and we don't need to move lower on that rate offering, we won't. But we did, in the December quarter, stay with 3.99% as the lowest 30-year fixed rate buydown we were offering.

And with 64% first-time homebuyer in your mortgage company, could you give any color as to whether you think an allowance of 401(k) savings to be used for deposit -- down payment would move the needle at all? Could that be material? Or do you think it's unlikely to be so?

Paul Romanowski
President, CEO & Director

I think anything that opens up the ability of people to either get to a monthly payment and/or get to a down payment, which are the two things, especially for a first-time homebuyer that we need to solve for, right? It's getting to a monthly payment that they're comfortable with, can and should afford as well as the down payment that they need to purchase a home. So we absolutely think it will be helpful. To what level, we'll see what gets put forward in terms of policy and how that plays out. But anything that we see to help get people moving, not just in the new home market but in the resale market as well, we believe, is accretive to our performance.

And the next question will be from Alex Barron from Housing Research Center.

Alex Barrón
Housing Research Center, LLC

I just wanted to confirm the volume guide you guys are giving, is that just for the wholly owned communities? Or does that also include the homes you guys are doing in rental communities?

Jessica Hansen
Senior VP of Communications & People and Head of Investor Relations

Sure, Alex. Our home closings guide for the year is for -- by our homebuilding operations. So it does not include single-family rental, but our revenue guide for the full year is consolidated revenues. So it would anticipate our rental revenue included in that.

Alex Barrón
Housing Research Center, LLC

Got it. And I wanted to ask on the margin guidance. Was that mainly driven by offering higher incentives in the way of rate buydowns or more like in the way of price cuts?

Bill Wheat
Executive VP & CFO

Mostly incentives based on buydowns and based on the level of buydowns and incentive costs we were seeing as we exited Q1 really driving the Q2 levels.

Alex Barrón
Housing Research Center, LLC

Okay. And if I could ask one last one. Are you guys starting to feel any impact from tariffs and materials costs?

Jessica Hansen
Senior VP of Communications & People and Head of Investor Relations

No. We still haven't taken any significant or noticeable increase in the material due to a tariff.
