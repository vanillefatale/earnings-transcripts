Question-and-Answer Session

Bryan Goldberg
Head of Investor Relations

And our first question today is going to come from Jason Helfstein on profitability. Can you talk through the puts and takes around gross margins across your premium and advertising segments in the third quarter? And how should we think about gross margins in the fourth quarter and 2026?

Christian Luiga
Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Jason. Yes, we are happy. Gross margin expansion is happening for the company this year. And as you are pointing out, there is a pressure more on the premium side than on the advertising side. That is really nothing really to worry about.

We started this year by letting you know that we are moving -- starting up the SPP program and moving over some of our podcast videos and podcast to utilize that content to give higher quality into the premium side. And when we do that, we recognize that cost now and premium instead of in advertising.

That shift doesn't mean anything on the total company level, but it actually then dampens a bit the margin on the premium side, and improves it on the advertising side. As we started this in quarter 1 this year, it will come through all through the year and therefore also impact quarter 4 in the same way.

Bryan Goldberg
Head of Investor Relations

Our next question is going to come from Jessica Reif Ehrlich on superfan potential. The major record labels have hinted at what's to come for a premium superfan tier. Will this product be created by the major labels for all DSPs? Or will there be a Spotify specific product?

Alex Norström
Chief Business Officer & Co-President

Jessica, like I mentioned, in calls -- in previous earnings calls, we keep a very high bar for our products. We simply ship products when they're ready. But what I can tell you really is that we are in deep collaboration with most of the relevant rights holders out there. Let me also just give you an example of why this is a good strategy, putting add-ons on Spotify on top of our premium subscription. A few months ago, we launched what we call Audiobooks+, which is a recurring option for people to use when they hit the wall of 15 hours in the markets where we have audiobooks. The uptake on that specific add-on subscription has been really, really good.

What's more is that on top of that, users are also buying top-ups. So really, what we're seeing is our ARPU levels that we've never seen before. So we're really encouraged by this as we keep adding -- as we keep launching add-ons on other further verticals and as part of ecosystem.

Bryan Goldberg
Head of Investor Relations

Okay. Our next question or a few questions here from Justin Patterson on AI. What impact do you believe AI will have on the music ecosystem and how does the ChatGPT integration fit into that? And in your collaboration with the labels, you also alluded to building products that create new revenue streams for the industry. Could you expand on what that means for royalties?

Gustav Söderström
Co-President, Chief Product & Technology Officer

This is Gustav. Thanks, Justin. I'll take that question. There are a couple of questions in here. I'll start sort of at a very higher level of what it means. One way to think about -- it means different things for us. For a consumer, it means a couple of things. First of all, you should expect, in general, recommendations to just get a lot better as the industry, including us, switches to what is called generative recommender systems.

These will -- these are using generative AI to understand much more of what the consumer is doing. One way to think about this is that recommendations are moving from just looking at passive clicks and saves and so forth, but actually understanding content and understanding you and specifically and very exciting for us, even understanding English.

This is why you can talk to the Spotify DJ in English, and it actually understands what you mean and can give you personalized recommendations. And I think if you play that out, what you should expect at a higher level is just much more user control, what we internally call Personalization 2.0, where you can literally talk to Spotify as if it was a person and it understands your specific taste.

So you can tell Spotify that you're actually tired of this specific genre now and you want to listen to something new that we have never seen in your listening data. So we can never predict it. But you can tell us, this is what you should expect, different level of personalization, different level of user control. On ChatGPT specifically, this is part of our ubiquity strategy.

One way to think about Spotify is that we've always tried to be where the users are. If the users are on Sonos, we're on Sonos. If they're in the car, we're in the car. If they're on Google, searching for music, we're on Google and a lot of people are on ChatGPT. So of course, we're going to be in ChatGPT. What's exciting about this is that you can do more than on many of the other platforms that we integrated in.

The beautiful thing about ChatGPT is that you can combine the power of ChatGPT to understand the world and use cases with Spotify understanding you. So now you can ask for a playlist related to something that happened in the world. But instead of that playlist just being the same for everyone on ChatGPT, it's also going to understand your Spotify user taste and make it personal to you.

This combination has never been possible before. And on your last question of products that we build with the industry, -- the way we think about this and generative AI for music is that just as with piracy, we think someone needs to work with the industry and with the artists to make this technology available for them in a legal way where we don't ask for forgiveness and where artists can actually participate and make money. That's why we're doing this.

Bryan Goldberg
Head of Investor Relations

Okay. Our next question is from Eric Sheridan on video strategy. Can you discuss the potential implications of your partnership with Netflix for video podcasts of the Ringer? How does this impact your overall strategy with respect to driving more video consumption on the platform?

Alex Norström
Chief Business Officer & Co-President

Good questions, Eric. So at the heart of it is that we believe in being creator first. So what we think is that when the creator wins, we win. And as creators optimize to create their best shows and interviews, which is really what they're focused on, they wanted to syndicate to everywhere.

And we believe, of course, in helping them to reach audiences in as many places as possible, which is consistent with our core philosophy on being creator first. And also, of course, to help them monetize as much as possible. the partnership with Netflix that you're asking about is really a meaningful opportunity for both of these beliefs and just a natural extension of our ecosystem.

And what's more is that we're already seeing some strong interest from creators who want to use Spotify as sort of their distribution hub, if you will. And to your second question more specifically, typically, when we have shows that originate on Spotify, we put them on YouTube.

Historically, that's just been driving even more awareness about the show and where it originated. And typically, what we see is just net incremental usage on Spotify coming from that. So very encouraged and very exciting to have this new Netflix partnership being rolled out as we speak.

Bryan Goldberg
Head of Investor Relations

Okay. Next question from Rich Greenfield on premium conversion. In your Instagram post, Gustav mentioned that free users liked the recent upgrades to their free functionality. Have you seen any changes to the rate of upgrade from free to premium as a result?

Gustav Söderström
Co-President, Chief Product & Technology Officer

Thank you, Rich. Yes, we are excited by all the features we launched, and we hope several of you are excited about specifically the Apple TV features as well. What we see is indeed more usage. And the way to think about Spotify is that you have a few proxies for what is ultimately retention and subscription value.

And it is more usage and specifically more usage, more days of the month, which we call active days. And so what we try to optimize for is more engagement per day, but specifically also more days per month. And we know over time that this simply leads to more conversion.

In fact, we coined the phrase many years ago that is -- that says the more you play, the more you pay eventually, which is why we always try to maximize engagement, both in the free tier and in the paid tier. So we are very certain that this will go the way it's always gone. People are using the service more, which is going to create more good news for us, both free and paid in the future.

Bryan Goldberg
Head of Investor Relations

We got another question from Jessica Reif Ehrlic this time on the leadership transition. Gustav and Alex, as you prepare to take over as co-CEOs in January, what are you most excited about in your respective areas?

Alex Norström
Chief Business Officer & Co-President

Thanks for that, Jessica. I'll start, Gustav, and then you can run in. I'm honestly really excited because I know that the ambition level is going up. And this has been the case. We've always had an increasing ambition level at Spotify. And we have this just amazing platform. The user fundamentals are really firing on all cylinders.

Daniel spoke to this in his remarks. With that, we sort of have -- and we have the 3 verticals that we have out there right now, all of which are producing results. And so we really have a platform to stand on that we can leverage to fulfill these new ambitions. And as you heard us talk about before, we now hit roughly 3% of the world's population. 3% of the world's population is subscribing to Spotify on a recurring basis every month they come back.

And with these 3 verticals, we really have like a very expansive TAM. We believe that most of the people in the world are interested in music. Most of the people in the world are interested in even the more expansive stuff like books and podcasts and video on top of that. So this just puts us in a very good position to fulfill this new ambition of getting to 1 billion subscribers.

Gustav Söderström
Co-President, Chief Product & Technology Officer

So I'll fill in. And in a way, nothing has changed in terms of why I'm excited. But in a way, some things are actually new. So I've managed to be excited about Spotify for over 17 years.

And the reason I've been excited about Spotify for 17 years is still the same, which is what Daniel mentioned initially that if you just look at the opportunity, music specifically, but also podcasts and books, but music specifically is probably the single biggest TAM you can find. I think it's even bigger than social networking or anything.

There's no one in the world that really doesn't like music at all. So it is the sort of the biggest TAM you can participate in. And -- that's been the case for a long time. But what is specifically exciting for me right now is that we are in one of these big macro shifts, the AI macro shift. That is -- I've said this before, but it's for me, certainly the most exciting since the smartphone came along.

And so if you look at those 2 together, when you enter one of these macro shifts, where you know from a product point of view, and I'm a product guy, you're going to get to reinnovate things and things are going to change. You kind of want to be in a position where the TAM is really big, you have a strong, healthy company with a lot of talented people behind you. So that's exactly where I find myself right now. That's why I'm excited.

Bryan Goldberg
Head of Investor Relations

We've got a related question from Justin Patterson on time spent. You've often talked about a TAM in the billions of users. How do you think about the time spent opportunity for music and non-music content given new categories like audiobooks that have been additive to listening hours?

Daniel Ek
Founder, CEO & Chairman

Yes, Justin. So I think much of this has been said already by both Gustav and Alex around the TAM and the opportunity. But I guess maybe to take a step back and what I think is more important, like what is the super power of this company.

And I think the super power of this company is really into mix between building great product experiences and figuring out how to monetize those product experiences at a level which is different from almost any other platform because the reality is we deal with a lot of professional content where there's an expectancy for us to figure out monetization from the start. It's not something we can wait for and figure out in a few years.

So that's really the superpower of this company. And when you then look at that from a TAM, not necessarily in numbers of users, but in time spent, it turns out that there's all of this amazing content that's out there, all of these amazing experiences that are out there that, for whatever reason, may not yet be at a user experience that is attractive to people or at a price point that makes it accessible to people.

And when you think about Spotify, that's really been at the intersection where we've been innovating. I think not only did we do that for music, not only did we do that for podcasting, but I think with audiobooks, that's certainly been our bet too, which is we just think that there is a lot more people that cares about audiobooks than what the market was showing at the time.

And that's part user experience and it's part business model. Now it turns out that there's plenty of other things out there that has considerable time spent that also doesn't necessarily have the right user experience nor the right business model. And when you add AI to the mix of that, there's -- that's a foundational technology that's going to enable totally new user experiences and business models, too. So we're really excited about it.

And I think when you look at sort of the AI world at the moment, of course, it's the foundational models and you have the sort of core assistant models that are doing incredibly well. But we aren't yet seeing a lot of these entirely new consumer experiences in AI having massive traction. But we think that there will be over the coming years, and we think we have the opportunity of being a net beneficiary of that.

Bryan Goldberg
Head of Investor Relations

Okay. Our next question is from Rich Greenfield on advertising. Looking at a 2-year stack of advertising revenue growth, FX neutral, you've decelerated from 31% in the third quarter of 2024 to 7% in the third quarter of 2025. And you've repeatedly talked to softness in pricing over the past several quarters. How do you return to robust ad growth?

Christian Luiga
Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Rich, for the question. And let me start, Christian here, and then I hand over to you, Alex, if you want to pitch in something. You are completely right. I mean we have a like-for-like single-digit growth now, mid-single-digit growth now in the quarter 3. And we came from a much better position before when it came to growth levels.

We did set a new long-term strategy that we believe in, and we are very confident that we will succeed with. It's not if, it's when. We came out in quarter 2 and expressed the progress and said that we are a little bit behind, and we need a little bit more time. But we do see really good progress on the programmatic side.

And the question is when that programmatic side is then growing so much in amount that it compensates for the direct sales. And that needs then a little bit more of the DSPs. Now we have Amazon and Yahoo coming on board in quarter 3 and to be on board and add value and then also the customers to shift more into the programmatic sales.

And that is progressing well, but the inflection point is a little bit further out than we expected before quarter 2. But as I said in my remarks also, we see that we're expecting to be back on the growth that we want in the second half of 2026. I don't know if you want to add something there, Alex.

Alex Norström
Chief Business Officer & Co-President

Rich, my friend. I'll add something to this. So when it comes to ad sales, it's a question of when, not if it's going to happen, right? We remain confident in the long-term strategy that we put in place, and I'm seeing that the dynamics really are improving to Christian's earlier points. So as it's not yet -- while it's not showing up in the top line, we are making progress.

As you can see in the deck that we sent out, the transformation of the ads business is really growing, in particular, in the new auction channels or biddable channels. And in Q3, we signed new DSP partnerships with Amazon and Yahoo. We also gave advertisers programmatic access to not just our audio inventory, but also our growing video inventory. So we are pushing hard to build for the long term. And while these changes will take some time, I do believe they'll yield significant results in the years ahead.

Bryan Goldberg
Head of Investor Relations

All right. Our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan on price increases. Can you talk about the elasticity and consumer behavior you're seeing after recent price increases in markets like Australia, where the magnitude was slightly higher? And what does it inform about potential in markets such as the U.S.?

Alex Norström
Chief Business Officer & Co-President

Well, Deepak, as you know, we don't discuss elasticity and the specifics when it comes to pricing. But what I can tell you, and I want to reiterate is that price increases are part of our strategy. You've seen this over the last couple of years. And of course, we will continue to do so, but in a thoughtful way. And this is always based on a number of different factors.

The important thing is that we're committed to pricing that reflects the value that we provide. And as we've talked about many times, Daniel mentioned it earlier. We've mentioned the V2P ratio that we want to balance over time. And we will act when the time is right for each specific market, and we'll do it at the appropriate price based on those market dynamics.

Bryan Goldberg
Head of Investor Relations

Okay. Our next question comes from Benjamin Black on our label relationships. You've now struck deals with all major labels from a high level. What do you think you've achieved? What added rights or added flexibility do you have? Do you still have the flexibility to pursue your nonmusic bundling strategy?

Alex Norström
Chief Business Officer & Co-President

Benjamin, typically, we don't discuss the specifics of these partners, but I wanted this time actually give you a little bit more color. As you may have heard, we're about to conclude another renewal round with all of our partners. And this is a very significant moment for us. For the first time in our history, we've got new modernized deals in place with all of the top 5 U.S. publishers.

Now these are new structures. They're true win-win deals that we built to address the core objective for both sides. And for our publishing partners, these agreements better recognize the value that songwriters create across our different offerings. For Spotify, to your specific question here, these deals secure broader video rights that we've long needed.

This was a critical strategic objective for us because it unlocks our ability to innovate and launch more products and features that you've seen us rolling out, which in turn grows the entire pie for everyone. And it just positions us to make continued progress towards our longer-term business goals. I'm super excited to just expand these partnerships with the wider industry as well as we focus on building a great future for music.

Bryan Goldberg
Head of Investor Relations

All right. Our next question is going to come from Eric Sheridan on -- a follow-up on the advertising. Can you discuss the forward path to revenue growth and gross margin trajectory for your ad-supported efforts? How much is the current advertising environment weighing on your third quarter reported revenue growth? And how do your new partnerships on the DSP side set the operation up for growth in 2026?

Christian Luiga
Chief Financial Officer

Just let me go back a little bit to the answer we just gave, Eric. First of all, on the margin side, as I elaborated in our first question today, the advertising business is actually benefiting from the move of SPP into the premium side, and that will continue through quarter 4. So starting quarter 1, we won't have that year-on-year benefit on the advertising margin.

And when it goes to the revenue side, I mean, and getting all these things in place, One of many things that we do this year to improve and drive the advertising revenue is to bring up the auction-based revenue. And you see that, and Alex alluded to that, you can see that in our slides that it is actually growing healthy.

And it's more when that inflection point comes when that growth actually surpasses the flatness or slight decline we have in the direct sales. We are not so much focused on the current ad environment because we have so much momentum in this transformation. So we feel very positive about with current situation that we will get into a healthy growth then in the second half of 2026.

Bryan Goldberg
Head of Investor Relations

Our next question comes from Michael Morris on video strategy. You've described video as a very exciting opportunity. In October, you agreed to license 16 of your own video podcasts to Netflix. How will this partnership enhance your video growth ambitions? And is there a risk that Spotify engagement declines or that Netflix builds its own competitor over time?

Gustav Söderström
Co-President, Chief Product & Technology Officer

Thanks, Michael. This is Gustav. I'll start here. As you said, we are indeed very excited about video podcast and SPP has driven significant interest from the creative community, and we now have almost 500,000 video podcasts and shows on our platform. And as you heard Alex mention, we're seeing meaningful uptake, more than almost 400 million, 390 million users stream the video podcast on Spotify, which is a 54% increase year-over-year.

So this is really working for us. The way to think about this is that we are building our experience better all the time on mobile, but also as we talked about on TV sets. But if you think of this from a creative point of view, this gives us the ability to give creators a tremendous opportunity. This is a choice for creators. We don't decide for them where they want to be.

They can be on Spotify and any other platform. But now we can offer the creators the opportunity to be on Spotify, but also get distribution on Netflix, which is ultimately very good for podcasters, and it also gives us revenue opportunities. This is the way to think about it. It's part of our ubiquity strategy.

And it's really important that while we build a good user experience, we also need to have a very strong creator offer. So this has really strengthened our creator offering, which is why we're seeing this growth, while more and more creators want to be on Spotify with their video.

Bryan Goldberg
Head of Investor Relations

A related question from Rich Greenfield on the TV opportunity. We recently saw you updated your Apple TV app to make it far more video focused. How significant is TV-based usage to Spotify today as a percentage of overall usage? And how does it play into your video advertising aspirations?

Gustav Söderström
Co-President, Chief Product & Technology Officer

Thanks, Richard. So to back out, the reason we are building our TV experiences is that it's part of a ubiquity strategy. What we've seen time and time again, and Alex has talked about this as well is as soon as you start using Spotify in more situations, whether that's in the car, on desktop, on a TV, your usage goes up, your time spent, your active days per month goes up and your retention goes up.

So at the core of it, this is part of our retention and ubiquity strategy. Now in terms of the opportunity, we think that we see really exciting engagement metrics. We're very happy with the usage, and we think we have plenty of room to grow in terms of users.

So we're very excited about the usage, and we think we have a lot of room to grow on the amount of users. Now this obviously also helps advertising, but it's not the core reason we're doing it. The core reason is because ubiquity drives engagement that drives retention for us.

Daniel Ek
Founder, CEO & Chairman

And on a specific note, we heard your complaints on the Apple TV app. So we hope you're happy, Rich. You can now use the new app.

Bryan Goldberg
Head of Investor Relations

Okay. We've got another question from Michael Morris on pricing. You recently raised prices in bundled service markets such as Australia and the U.K. The increases in Australia were larger on a percentage basis than those in the U.K. Why were the U.K. changes smaller? And do you expect future price increases to more closely look like those in Australia or those in the U.K.?

Alex Norström
Chief Business Officer & Co-President

Thanks, Michael. So we -- when we adjust prices in markets, we take into consideration a number of different factors. We look at things like household income.

We look at things like maturity of the market. We look at things like specific value to price ratio if there's a specific different offering in that market. And all of this we take into account. And when the timing is right, we do it and we do it in the magnitude that is right for that market.

Bryan Goldberg
Head of Investor Relations

All right. We've got time for a few more questions. I got a follow-up one from Deepak Mathivanan. Gustav, AI models are getting much better in formats like video and audio. As a platform, do you see opportunity for Spotify to help artists with AI tools for their music creation process? Can you talk about Spotify's strategy to enable AI tools for creators?

Gustav Söderström
Co-President, Chief Product & Technology Officer

Thanks, Deepak. So certainly, we do, and this is what I mentioned previously when we talked about the industry initiatives. What we think is important is that someone does this in a way where artists in the music industry can get to participate and to choose if they want to use these tools.

There's obviously a lot of excitement, but also a lot of fear around these tools. So we are trying to be the ones who do this responsibly. And we're very excited about that. I don't want to talk more about the specific at this time, but that's what we're trying to do.

But it's also important to remember that it's not only for music. We think AI tools are also very helpful for podcasters and for authors. So we want to help all creators with these kinds of tools.

Bryan Goldberg
Head of Investor Relations

Our next question is from Batya Levi on engagement. Can you talk about the impact on engagement and conversion to paid from the enhancements added to the free tier? How should we think about impact on margins and monetization opportunities down the road?

Alex Norström
Chief Business Officer & Co-President

Thanks, Batya. First of all, the process is working. We're taking share even in the most competitive markets. And since you kind of asked, here comes a mini sermon on subscriptions growth from me to you. So the key to subscriptions growth is really a strong funnel. And to build a strong funnel, you need really 3 things.

One is, of course, engagement, and we've talked about that earlier in the call. And our engagement, the listening hours on Spotify and also the active days that Gustav spoke to, they're growing. And they're growing, thanks to the numerous product launches that we have. This means that we keep people on the platform, which is, again, very important for a strong funnel.

And the second thing that's important is that when we adjust prices, when we raise prices, you need minimal churn. And that's also what we're seeing. Third of all, and then to your point, as specific question, is about intake. For healthy subscriptions growth, you need a good replenishment of MAU. And as you can hear us talk about this quarter, that really is the standout number.

Our MAU is increasing to higher levels than we expected. And as MAUs grow, we also see engagement grow. And as the engagement of the MAUs grow, we typically see much higher levels of conversion. Every time that we have made a change to the free product and it's generated more MAU in the history of Spotify, it's led to more business growth down the line. So we just have to trust the funnel.

Bryan Goldberg
Head of Investor Relations

Our last question today is going to come from Jason Bazinet. You've taken some price increases in a few markets, but the price gap between Spotify and rivals varies by market, and you talk about your philosophy regarding price increases and specifically, what metrics give you more confidence to price the service well above versus just above your competitors?

Alex Norström
Chief Business Officer & Co-President

Thanks, Jason. Well, the answer is sort of embedded in a part of your question here. We pay attention to competition, but what we pay attention the most attention to is obviously our own offering. And we care a lot about the value to price ratio. You've heard Gustav talk about how we've shipped much faster in this last quarter.

There's more than 30 product -- 30 features that's been shipped in the product and users are loving it, right? So the important thing for us is just keep continuing to improve the value to price ratio, meaning raising value and relentlessly just build the best product out there. The best product will always win.

And then when we look at our product and the value that it reflects, we will then take steps to understand if we need to adjust the price or not. And again, like I said many times before, it's based on specific market dynamics.

Gustav Söderström
Co-President, Chief Product & Technology Officer

And some of the things give us confidence is, as we've said many times, engagement, day spent per month, where we know that we are well, well ahead of our competitors.

Daniel Ek
Founder, CEO & Chairman

Maybe just an addition from my side, too. I think implied in the question is that perhaps there's a comparison of music to music competitors. But in many markets where we act now, Spotify is not just a music service anymore. It is a music podcast and an audiobooks service. In some markets, we haven't yet gotten to with our audiobooks offering.

So as you look at our pricing, we are factoring in the value, not just in music, but in all of the verticals that we act as well. And I think this is an important addition to add because in a lot of the markets, their perception of what Spotify is, is just very different than what it is in other markets as well.

Bryan Goldberg
Head of Investor Relations

All right Great. Thanks, everyone, for the questions. That concludes the Q&A session today. I want to hand the floor back over to Daniel for some closing remarks.

Daniel Ek
Founder, CEO & Chairman

All right. Thanks, Bryan. Well, I think the headline here is quite simple. The business is healthy. We're shipping faster than ever, and we have all the tools we need. We have pricing, product innovation, operational leverage and eventually the ads turnaround to deliver both revenue growth and profit expansion.

I said earlier, it all comes back to user fundamentals, and that's where we are. 700 million users who keep coming back, engagement at all-time highs, we're building Spotify for the long term.

And as I transition to Executive Chairman, I couldn't be more confident in what's ahead. Alex and Gustav have been instrumental in getting us here, and I'm excited to watch them take Spotify to the next level. Thank you, everyone, for joining today.

Bryan Goldberg
Head of Investor Relations

Okay. And that concludes today's call. A replay will be available on our website and also on the Spotify app under Spotify Earnings Call Replays. Thanks, everyone, for joining.

Operator

And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.
