Co-Founder, CEO & Chairman

Thanks, Sam. The first half of this year brought an incredible wave of momentum across the advanced nuclear sector from new federal programs and executive actions to growing customer and investor interest in clean, reliable power. That momentum has continued into the third quarter and is creating a very different environment for deployment than even a year ago. We strongly believe Oklo is uniquely positioned to thrive in this environment. Our mission at Oklo continues to be focused and clear: to deliver clean, reliable, affordable energy at a global scale.

We started this company with the belief that advanced nuclear power could play a transformative role in the world's energy future. That meant rethinking everything, how we design reactors, how we license and fuel them, and how we operate them and engage customers. That same vision continues to guide us today, and it remains fully aligned with where we believe policy, technology and customer demand are headed.

Our competitive advantages come from the intersection of several core strategies: our business model, our scalable design and our proven technology. First, our build-own-operate model allows us to sell power directly to customers under long-term contracts. That creates recurring revenue and streamlines the regulatory process by keeping ownership and operational control within Oklo. Second, our small scalable design means we can deploy assets quickly and incrementally, matching customer demand while leveraging existing industrial supply chains and factory fabrication. That reduces on-site construction risk, lowers cost and supports faster rollout. And third, our liquid metal sodium cool technology is built on a foundation of more than 400 combined reactor years of operating experience worldwide, including the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II, which operated successfully for 3 decades in the United States. That operating record is one of the most tested, demonstrated and validated in advanced nuclear history, and it gives us deep confidence in the performance, safety and reliability of our design. It's also the reason we can move directly into commercialization without the need for costly time-consuming demonstration plants.

Oklo was building on that proven foundation to become the hub for metal fuel and fast reactor innovation, integrating design, licensing, fuel supply and recycling into a unified platform. This gives us a significant flexibility across fuels, fresh HALEU, recycled material and down-blended alternatives and positions Oklo at the center of how this next phase of advanced nuclear power will scale. Additionally, Oklo's work across areas needed to deploy its reactors position the company to benefit from capabilities, including products and services from fuel fabrication, recycling and isotopes to go along with power and heat sales from its reactors. Together, these advantages position Oklo to deploy at speed and scale with the model built for long-term growth and leadership in advanced nuclear energy.

We have continued to make meaningful progress this quarter across every part of the business, from licensing and project execution to fuel development, partnerships and the customer pipeline. On the regulatory front, we were selected for 3 projects under the Department of Energy's new Reactor Pilot Program, or RPP, giving Oklo access to Department of Energy authorization pathways that accelerate deployment time lines and complement our ongoing NRC work.

And we submitted our Principal Design Criteria topical report to the NRC and received notice of acceptance in just 15 days, about half the time typically expected. NRC also indicated that the draft evaluation is expected in early 2026, which would be less than half the traditional review time line. And just before the RPP announcement, Oklo also completed a readiness assessment with the NRC for the Phase 1 of its COLA application, which found no gaps to application acceptance for review.

We also broke ground on the Aurora-INL, marking the start of physical construction activities. We also advanced plans for Atomic Alchemy's pilot project under the RPP. Finally, we successfully completed fuel assembly flow testing, demonstrating progress in the fabrication and handling systems that will serve many Oklo powerhouses.

In fuel and recycling, we announced Oklo's Advanced Fuel Center, up to $1.68 billion investment that anchors our long-term fuel supply chain and were selected for the Department of Energy's Advanced Nuclear Fuel Line Pilot Program, which accelerates U.S. fuel fabrication capacity. We achieved a key regulatory milestone with the Department of Energy's approval of the Nuclear Safety Design Agreement, or NSDA, for the Aurora fuel fabrication facility. The NSDA, the first approved under the DOE's Fuel Line Pilot Projects, was completed in under 2 weeks and demonstrates a new authorization pathway that can help unlock U.S. industrial capacity, strength in national energy security and accelerate domestic fuel production under the executive order, deploying advanced nuclear reactor technologies for national security. The approval reflects the strength of our technical submissions and proactive DOE engagement and builds on our Aurora-INL groundbreaking to advance an integrated model of fuel production, plant construction and power delivery.

We also strengthened our partnership with Idaho National Laboratory through a new agreement with Battelle Energy Alliance, the lab's management and operations contractor. The collaboration focuses on advancing fuel and materials research that supports Oklo's and other companies' commercial deployments and takes advantage of Aurora-INL's unique ability to generate real-world data during operation, including fast neutrons for testing and research. That data will help us characterize materials faster, characterize fuels faster, improve designs more efficiently and continue driving innovation across the nuclear technology landscape.

In other words, this partnership is about expanding the Aurora-INL's mission to include fast neutron irradiation capabilities. These are capabilities that have been lacking in the U.S. for decades. We signed new international partnerships with European nuclear companies Blykalla and newcleo to advance joint technology and fuel manufacturing capabilities and demonstrate our emerging technical leadership in this space.

On the customer pipeline side, we're evaluating potential power sales with the Tennessee Valley Authority as part of our Tennessee Fuel Center initiative, and we're continuing to advance discussions with both previously announced and new customers as we expand our commercial pipeline across data centers, utilities and defense markets. We are also exploring potential fuel offtakes with the Tennessee Valley Authority as part of our Tennessee Fuel Center as well.

And financially, we closed the quarter with a strong balance sheet, approximately $1.2 billion in cash and marketable securities with cash burn tracking in line with expectations. Following the close of the third quarter, we also filed a new shelf registration to maintain flexibility and access to capital markets as we scale. Taken together, these milestones reflect the execution momentum behind Oklo's potential for near-term success, licensing, acceleration, supply chain build-out and commercial traction all moving in parallel.

This quarter marked a major milestone for Oklo with our selection under the Department of Energy's Reactor Pilot Program. The RPP was established earlier this year following new executive actions that directed DOE to take a leading role in advancing next-generation reactor deployment as part of the broader U.S. energy renaissance. Nuclear power is a federal priority with strong bipartisan support, reflecting the shared recognition that advanced nuclear energy is essential to meeting America's energy security and economic objectives.

Oklo received 3 of the 11 granted awards, 2 led by Oklo and 1 by our subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy. The awarded projects include Oklo's Aurora-INL, our first powerhouse, Atomic Alchemy's pilot plant for radioisotope production and Oklo's Pluto, a test reactor supporting advanced fuel and component development. Participation in the Reactor Pilot Program gives us access to a Department of Energy authorization pathway, aligning our projects with federal review and creating the potential to accelerate construction and operation time lines. Just as importantly, the RPP provides a venue for generating operating data that will help derisk commercial licensing for future powerhouses, strengthening our overall regulatory foundation.

This selection positions Oklo as one of the first advanced reactor companies moving from design to build under DOE oversight, reinforcing that the momentum behind nuclear energy in the United States is broad-based, durable and growing. The DOE's authorization pathway represents one of the most important policy shifts we've seen for advanced reactors in decades, expanding regulatory tools without reducing safety expectations. For Oklo, it effectively provides a structured approach and process to begin constructing our first powerhouse under DOE oversight while maintaining full alignment with NRC standards. The DOE pathway enables faster demonstration of clean power while maintaining the same rigorous safety expectations and provides an opportunity for a rapid transition to an NRC license for full commercial operation.

Here's what changed. In May, new executive actions established a clear DOE authorization process for first-of-a-kind nuclear plants, a process that now complements rather than replaces traditional NRC licensing. Within months, we moved to qualify our Aurora-INL powerhouse under that framework. We expect to finalize our other transaction authority or OTA agreement and have approval of our Nuclear Safety Design Agreement, or NSDA, with the DOE by the end of the year.

So here's how it works. DOE will authorize construction and initial operations under its modernized framework, which allows us to begin building while the longer commercial NRC transition proceeds in parallel. We don't need full operating approvals to finalize construction, which reduces idle time without compromising safety. Once the initial data is collected, the project can then transition to NRC oversight. This approach builds on DOE's decades of experience managing nuclear facilities with an exceptional safety record from naval propulsion to national laboratory programs. It doesn't lower the bar. It simply puts the right reviewers in the right place.

From a broader perspective, this model has the potential to unlock U.S. industrial capacity, strengthen national energy security and create a repeatable template for future advanced reactor deployment. Importantly, DOE and the NRC are complementary, not competitive. Their teams have a long history of collaboration, and we expect continued coordination throughout this process to ensure a smooth handoff when conversion occurs.

For investors and customers, this change hopefully means less time line risk, better capital efficiency and earlier validation of cost and performance. The bottom line is that DOE authorization derisks the Aurora-INL regulatory path and allows Oklo to focus on building and operating powerhouses while maintaining the same safety rigor and establishing a scalable modern pathway for the next generation of advanced reactors.

As we pursue authorization under the DOE, we're maintaining steady momentum with the NRC to prepare for full commercial licensing. This is a parallel engagement strategy, not competing reviews but coordinated progress that lets us move faster while maintaining regulatory rigor. Our work with the NRC remains focused on 2 priorities: first, completing ongoing pre-application reviews and topical reports for the Aurora-INL and future sites; and second, leveraging data from DOE authorized operations to further inform NRC licensing for the broader commercial fleet. In practice, this means we'll finalize DOE authorization documentation and begin Aurora-INL construction and operations under DOE oversight while continuing NRC pre-application work for follow-on deployments.

The learnings from real-world performance data, fuel behavior and operating experience will feed directly into the NRC's combined license process, which we expect could compress the time line from the Aurora-INL to fleet deployment. We expect to submit licensing actions next year to support construction for subsequent sites, and our goal is to use operating data from the Aurora-INL to strengthen each subsequent submission.

This strategy ensures that as DOE authorizations advance early construction and operation, the NRC pathway continues in parallel, creating a repeatable data-supported model for commercial powerhouse deployment. We expect the result to be a clear regulatory sequence: build and operate under DOE, then transition to NRC oversight. Acting on lessons learned, we will demonstrate a replicable commercial licensing framework for the next generation of Oklo powerhouses.

With Idaho National Laboratory, we've officially broken ground on our first Aurora powerhouse, marking a major milestone in Oklo's transition from design and permitting to active construction. As mentioned, we're progressing under DOE's Reactor Pilot Program, which provides federal oversight and coordination as we move from preparation to build. Kiewit has mobilized major equipment to the site, and earthworks began October 27 to be followed by controlled blasting in mid-November, targeting full excavation in early January.

For Oklo, this is a defining moment. It represents the shift from planning to physical build with the same discipline and execution framework that will carry through our future projects. This first site establishes the template for future powerhouses demonstrating our ability to execute as we move toward operations. With construction now underway at INL, we're also making strong progress on the procurement and supply chain front, securing the long lead components and supplier commitments that keep our schedule on track.

This quarter, we completed major procurements for in-vessel and ex-vessel handling machines, primary and intermediate sodium pumps, the reactor trip system and fuel assembly nozzle fabrication. These are some of the most technically significant systems in the powerhouse, and having them under contract early locks in pricing, time lines and fabrication slots with qualified vendors. It also demonstrates the maturity of our supply chain, a key differentiator for Oklo, showing that we can source critical components through proven industrial partners rather than relying on bespoke first-time suppliers.

We are procuring these components in a dynamic and continually evolving environment amid fluctuating tariffs, supply chain pressures and inflation. These challenges make procurement especially challenging, but our business model and the repeatability of our asset deployment plans will allow us to learn from our experience over time, even if costs are higher or there are other unexpected developments that impact our first few powerhouses. We have the opportunity to iterate and improve as we scale up our operations to ultimately build a reliable and cost-effective supply chain.

It is also worth noting that the future reactor deployments may benefit from a reduction in costs compared to the Aurora-INL in part due to the required additional fuel and core testing capabilities. This progress builds real confidence in our ability to execute efficiently and scale repeatedly as we move from this first powerhouse to a broader fleet under the DOE's Reactor Pilot Program and future commercial deployments.

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy, also achieved a major milestone this quarter with its selection under the Department of Energy's Reactor Pilot Program. The selection makes the Atomic Alchemy pilot facility eligible for DOE authorization, creating a faster pathway to construction and operations. The pilot facility is designed to prove isotope production, validate supply chain readiness and derisk the deployment of a larger commercial scale VIPR facility. In the near term, the team is finalizing DOE authorization documentation and advancing site selection and procurement with the intent to be operational by mid-2026.

Over the medium term, Atomic Alchemy will begin at a separate lab scale facility, production and initial isotope sales, creating an early revenue stream while expanding commercial and operational experience. Longer term, the focus shifts to securing an NRC license for full-scale VIPR facility, scaling to multiyear offtake agreements and carrying forward the procedures and quality assurance systems proven in the pilot facility to streamline future deployment.

What's important here is that Atomic Alchemy isn't just an adjacent business. It's a strategic extension of Oklo's technology platform. The business creates near-term production revenue potential and represents a paradigm shift in an underserved high-potential market. The Atomic Alchemy VIPR reactor or Versatile Isotope Production Reactor is also quite a bit different than Oklo's Aurora. The VIPR reactor is designed to produce isotopes and therefore, produce neutrons. It is an open water-cooled type reactor that is not pressurized and uses conventional 17x17 pressurized water reactor fuel bundles fueled with LEU at a shortened height. This means the reactors can be built and supplied quickly and produce a variety of isotopes that serve health care, defense and industrial applications. Isotopes are, generally speaking, vastly undersupplied in the U.S. and can play a similar role to critical minerals in terms of national resilience and security.

Our unique and differentiated approach to fuel brings together several complementary sources to cover near-, mid- and long-term needs. Near term, we're drawing on DOE materials like EBR-II fuel and potentially, plutonium-based feedstock to fuel early units. Midterm, our partnerships with Centrus, Hexium and others expand fresh HALEU access and reduce single vendor risk. Longer term, our Tennessee Advanced Fuel Center positions us to recycle and fabricate our own fuel domestically at scale from used fuel inventories. Taken together, this strategy reduces cost and schedule risk, strengthens U.S. energy resilience and ensures we can keep building regardless of how the enrichment market evolves.

Fuel remains one of the most important inputs for advanced nuclear power and one of the most complex to forecast right now. The reality is that the cost environment for HALEU and related materials looks very different today than it did in 2024. Tariffs, supply chain constraints, inflation and evolving sanctions have all changed the market dynamics. The global enrichment landscape is still shifting and so are the pricing assumptions that come with it. This is challenging work, and we're owning it. We're building the most resilient, diversified fuel strategy in the sector because we know fuel optionality will determine who scales successfully in the years ahead most quickly.

We don't yet know where HALEU costs will ultimately land, but what we do know is that Oklo has more pathway than flexibility than other companies in the space. We'll continue refining our cost models and expect to share more detailed updates next year as the pricing picture becomes clearer, but the takeaway today is straightforward. Fuel markets are changing and Oklo is built to adapt, especially in the current fuel environment with additional government materials becoming available to serve as bridge fuel supplies.

We think it's useful to spend a little time eliminating HALEU's supply chains and how they work. The current models in the U.S. and in the world, generally speaking, involve several steps starting with uranium mining to then uranium milling to then conversion to then enrichment to then deconversion and then ultimately to fuel fabrication.

Next-generation models might change this significantly. This is one of the reasons why we take a multipronged approach in partnering with HALEU providers, not just to work with those operating today in the supply chains that fit today's models but also for next-generation technologies that have the potential to have lower capital and operating costs that can simplify the processes and offer value chain consolidation and operate more flexibly, which can all together mean opportunities for lower cost HALEU.

And beyond HALEU, Oklo's also taking a multipronged approach for sourcing fuel both in the near term as well as the long term. We discussed this a little bit already, but there are several major pools of material to think about for fueling our reactors going forward. For one, there are significant government uranium reserves. Some of this material stands in highly enriched form and can be downloaded into fuel for reactors. Some of it might also be in prior or previously irradiated fuel that can be recovered and then produced into fuel for reactors. That is where we're getting the first 5 tons of fuel for our first plant, 5 tons of fuel produced from EBR-II fuel that has been recovered and down-blended to make fuel suitable for use in our Aurora plant.

An important feature about some of that material is that it carries impurities because it spent time in a reactor. Those impurities do not necessarily make it suitable for all reactors to be able to use it, but our reactor, by being a fast reactor and by being designed to be versatile in its fuel, can use it.

Additionally, the government has significant reserves of plutonium that it is now making available as a bridge source of fuel for commercial power plants. This is significant because the government recently announced up to 20 tons being made available in tranches. That could be made into about 180 metric tons of Aurora fuel. This is a massive bridge supply of fuel that can get us beyond not just our first few plants but out into our first 10 to 20 plants within an opportunity to scale beyond that with commercial enrichment sourcing as well as recycling.

And the way this works is by taking the plutonium and blending it with unenriched uranium to make a fuel that can be used in our reactors. That negates and avoids the need for any enrichment and can accelerate time to market as well as reduce total capital investments needed to actually produce fuel for our plants. We are exploring the opportunities to use this material given that it can be a significant bridge to future supplies.

Those future supplies really comprise of 2 main approaches is how we think about it. There are the conventional enrichers that, in many cases, are already producing LEU and are either actively or exploring expanding production into HALEU as well as advanced enrichers that bring forward different technologies and centrifuges that have unique upside and potential but may, in some cases, stand lower on the technology readiness development spectrum. But these technologies offer opportunities for value chain consolidation, lower cost of production, lower cost of operation and ultimately, the ability to use lower cost feedstocks. This can ultimately translate to lower cost HALEU at scale as well.

And ultimately, recycling is a key part of our fuel strategy because of how significant it is in unlocking significant reserves of fuel. I use that term duplicitously on purpose, significant because it is hard to overstate how much material there is in the U.S. that can be made into fuel. The reason this is the case is because reactors, in general, only use a few percent of the fuel in one path. So today's reactors, for example, only use about 5% of the fuel in a single path through the reactor. That means the used fuel that's discharged or often referred to as waste actually has about 95% of its fuel remaining.

With our recycling technologies, we can tap into that, pull that material out and reuse it as fuel in our reactors. We can also recycle the fuel from our reactors as well as other advanced reactors that will likely get built. This positions Oklo well to have a long-term, very durable supply of fuel going forward.

Continuing on recycling. One of our biggest advancements this quarter was the announcement of our Advanced Fuel Center in Tennessee, beginning with the fuel recycling facility located in Oak Ridge. This is the first privately funded recycling facility of its kind in the U.S., representing an investment of up to $1.68 billion in creating more than 800 permanent jobs. In addition to the fuel recycling facility, this investment is expected to include other Oklo assets, such as one or more powerhouses and a fuel fabrication facility.

The facility adds another layer of vertical integration to Oklo's business, enabling us to convert used fuel into new metal fuel for our powerhouses. It strengthens U.S. capability and gives Oklo more supply chain control on our path to scale.

We're tracking towards an initial production ramp-up in the early 2030s with regulatory engagement already underway through the NRC pre-application process. We're also working with the Tennessee Valley Authority on potential collaboration around used nuclear fuel feedstock transfer as well as power generation from Aurora powerhouses. This project isn't just about fuel supply. It's about creating a durable domestic foundation for advanced nuclear power. It anchors Oklo's long-term fuel strategy and positions Tennessee as a national hub for clean energy manufacturing and innovation.

In parallel, there's growing federal support for advanced fuel recycling. Just last week, the Senate Energy and Public Works Committee announced the Nuclear REFUEL Act of 2025, which proposes updates to the Atomic Energy Act to provide regulatory clarity for licensing advanced fuel recycling facilities. If enacted, this legislation could further streamline the licensing process for our Tennessee facility.

Building on the momentum from the Tennessee Fuel Center, we were also selected by the Department of Energy for the Advanced Nuclear Fuel Line Pilot Program. This program is designed to accelerate construction and operation of domestic fuel fabrication facilities, strengthening U.S. capability and ensuring that advanced reactors like ours have a reliable long-term supply of fuel. Under this initiative, DOE awarded 3 Oklo-led fuel-related projects, allowing us to build and operate facilities that directly support our powerhouse deployments and complement the work underway at our Advanced Fuel Center and Aurora-INL fuel fabrication facility.

The Fuel Line Pilot Program mirrors the intent of the reactor pilot program, to create alternative pathways for advanced nuclear deployment that move faster, streamline reviews and leverage private investment alongside federal oversight. For Oklo, it does 3 important things. It presents an opportunity to secure near-term fuel for early powerhouses, producing one of the biggest bottlenecks facing the industry. It reinforces U.S. manufacturing and fuel independence, supporting the national effort to rebuild domestic nuclear capacity; and it stacks directly with our Tennessee facility, creating a vertically integrated ecosystem for recycling, fabrication and deployment.

Together, these programs, the reactor pilot and fuel line pilots form the backbone of a modern U.S. nuclear strategy, and Oklo's one of the few companies positioned across both with the capabilities to deliver on near-term milestones while building the infrastructure for the long term.

With that, I'll pass it to Craig to share progress on our strategic partnerships and financials. Craig?

Richard Bealmear
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Jake. As Jake mentioned, Oklo is leading the advanced nuclear effort here in the United States, but we are also experiencing growing international momentum around fast reactors and metal fuel technology. This quarter, we signed new transatlantic partnerships with Blykalla and newcleo, 2 European companies advancing fast reactor and fuel fabrication technologies. These collaborations strengthen our supply chain strategies, expand our technology base and align with broader trends across both the United States and Europe for a renewed commitment to nuclear innovation, manufacturing and partnership.

With Blykalla, we entered into a joint technology development agreement to collaborate in key areas where there's mutual benefit such as balance of plant components, regulatory learnings and fuel strategy. We also co-led their recent funding round, building across Atlantic partnership that benefits both companies.

With newcleo, we've launched a strategic partnership to develop advanced fuel fabrication and manufacturing infrastructure in the United States under domestic oversight. newcleo could invest up to $2 billion through an affiliated vehicle to expand U.S. capacity and support our metal fuel platform.

Taken together, these collaborations represent the next step in Oklo's evolution and could help us accelerate cost reduction, leverage international capital and extend our reach into markets where demand for advanced nuclear power is growing rapidly. Oklo is combining proven fast reactor technology with a global ecosystem of partners, suppliers and investors who are equally focused on delivering scalable, zero-carbon baseload power.

I'll now provide a summary of our financials. Oklo's third quarter operating loss was $36.3 million, inclusive of noncash stock-based compensation expense of $9.1 million. Oklo's loss before income taxes in the third quarter was $29.2 million, which reflects our operating loss adjusted for net interest income of $7.1 million.

On a year-to-date basis, when adjusting for noncash stock-based compensation charges, changes to working capital and deferred income tax benefits, the cash used in operating activities equates to $48.7 million. We still expect, on a full year basis, our cash used in operating activities to be within our guided range of $65 million to $80 million that we disclosed at the start of this year.

In addition, to build on earlier discussion point in this company update, we have started to make modest capital investments in 2025, which include advancing deployment of activities at INL for our Aurora powerhouse and fuel fabrication facilities as well as for the Reactor Pilot Program for which we have been selected. The Reactor Pilot Program not only includes work in our power and fuel businesses but also the award received by Atomic Alchemy. This spin has been enabled by various accelerators we have seen across the business in 2025.

Finally, in the third quarter, we successfully completed an at-the-market fundraising program generating $540 million in gross proceeds, providing the company with additional cash on hand to deliver our enhanced growth agenda. As a result of the capital raise, we ended third quarter with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet.

As we wrap up, I want to connect the key themes you've heard today to what makes Oklo a compelling investment opportunity. We are now executing, not theorizing on advanced nuclear power. Our proven fast reactor technology is designed for speed, simplicity and scalability, and our first powerhouse at INL is under construction. We've built a fully integrated fuel strategy that few others can match. From early access to fuel for the Aurora-INL powerhouse to fabrication under the Department of Energy's Fuel Line Pilots to long-term recycling through our Advanced Fuel Center in Tennessee. We have based our strategy on feedstock integration and multiple long-term fuel cycle delivery pathways that should provide cost stability and supply security as we grow our fleet.

Our radioisotope business has a high-margin adjacent revenue stream that leverages a similar technology base, regulatory pathway, facilities and core competencies to further diversify our earnings potential. And our build-own-operate model creates recurring revenue through long-term power contracts, driving margin visibility and capital efficiency.

Finally, our growing customer pipeline for power spans data centers, defense, utilities and industrials, confirms strong durable demand from what we are building. In short, Oklo is delivering on its plans, proven technology, a differentiated field strategy, global partnerships and a business model designed to scale. We're executing today and positioned to lead the next era of clean, reliable energy.

Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
