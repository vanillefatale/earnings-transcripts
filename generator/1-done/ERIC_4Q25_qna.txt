Question-and-Answer Session

Daniel Morris
Head of Investor Relations

Thanks, Börje. We'll now move to the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Thanks. Okay. Operator, we're ready to open the line for the first question.

The first question today is going to come from the line of Simon Granath at ABG.

Simon Granath
ABG Sundal Collier Holding ASA, Research Division

Congrats team Ericsson for the solid results here. On OpEx, I'd like to push a bit on the medium-term trajectory and the R&D balance. With the RAN demand looking broadly flattish into 2026. OpEx growth largely reflecting salary inflation rather than volumes. If we assume a similar demand environment into 2027 with [indiscernible] still later in this decade, how do you think about the risk of managing R&D and were capabilities changes too early? So simply on the mid-term OpEx trajectory?

Lars Sandstrom
Senior VP, Head of Group Function Finance & CFO

Mid-term. When you look at the OpEx levels that we have today, and the structure we have, it's a question about working and investing, and we are already in 2025 and back -- and going into this year, there are key strategic areas where we are investing and some other areas where we are taking other decisions. So I think that -- and that will also be how we will work going into 2027.

Then of course, there is a continuous cost inflation that we need to drive through productivity to ensure that we keep the right level here going forward as well. So there will -- and when these big investment comes, we will see. I think you will have to comment as well from your perspective.

Borje Ekholm
President, CEO, Head of Segment Enterprise & Director

Yes. I think the -- given the flattish market we're in, we will have to work continuously on the, I call it, R&D efficiency. But there is also a question of making sure we allocate to the right areas. This is why new areas like mission-critical is actually critical to be part of as well as defense applications. So we believe that we can -- even in a flattish market, we can actually have the right R&D level with the program and with the efforts we have in place.

But it's, as you know, it requires us to really be at the forefront of R&D efficiency as well. But you should not expect us to -- put it this way, we are not going to trade off technology leadership, and we believe we can have technology leadership at the spend level even into '27 and beyond.

Daniel Morris
Head of Investor Relations

Moving to the next question, please. The next question is going to come from the line of Erik Rojestal at SEB.

Erik Lindholm-Rojestal
SEB, Research Division

Congratulations on the results here. So just Börje, you mentioned increasing investment in defense in '26 and mission-critical was a key driver here in the quarter. I understand this is a good market for you right now, but can you please shed some light on how large the exposure is that you have currently in this area? And what the size of the opportunities that you see out there? How large are they?

Borje Ekholm
President, CEO, Head of Segment Enterprise & Director

We -- if we start in the end of discussing -- first of all, what we want to say here is, in reality, the investments we make in defense today is captured in the total R&D spend. And as we go forward where we see that, we probably need to increase that a bit. And the reason for that is we actually see the potential for a very sizable market in defense given what the spending in the U.S., of course, but it's also the increased European spending on defense will make this into a fairly sizable market.

And we see that market moving from, what I would call, dedicated solutions, kind of proprietary technology solutions into much more 3GPP-enabled solutions. And the reason for that is simply that is more cost effective and it's going to be much better performance. So we see actually the communication market in defense to be a sizable opportunity that we want to make sure we're early on in. But there are also other applications.

So think about defense from a broader perspective, the sensing capabilities of the solutions we have actually allows you to, for example, do drone detection. Think about where the usefulness of that and it can do detection of objects that are not connected. So it's basically maybe popular wording will be called the radar.

These are major opportunities that we would say are really large that we want to position ourselves to go after. So when you see us increasing spending, it's not -- I think part of it will be offset with other efficiency gains, but we want to say that we actually go after an opportunity here that we think is rather sizable.

Daniel Morris
Head of Investor Relations

Thanks, Erik. Moving to the next question, please. The next question is going to come from the line of Jakob Bluestone at BNP.

Jakob Bluestone
BNP Paribas, Research Division

I had a question around supply chain shortages. I'm wondering sort of broadly, are you seeing any issues that might hold back your ability to grow? And specifically, can you comment on the impact of memory price increases? So what share of your bill of materials relates to memory chips? Do you hedge these? Can you pass on any price increases to customers?

Lars Sandstrom
Senior VP, Head of Group Function Finance & CFO

When it comes to the supply chain, I think we have worked for quite some time on resiliency. And when it comes -- that is including then supply chain, so to say, deliveries. So that is continuous work that we do. So -- but of course, when it comes to the memory side, it has been quite a bit of noise around that. But I think we are in a good position of handling that as it looks for this year here.

And on the pricing side, it is a mix. Of course, there is some impact, but also here, it's really working close with our suppliers also together with our customers to make sure that we are not squeezed in the middle here. So it's both ends here to work with.

Jakob Bluestone
BNP Paribas, Research Division

Can you maybe just expand how have you avoided shortages? Is this just by building inventories, just given the sort of...

Lars Sandstrom
Senior VP, Head of Group Function Finance & CFO

It's part of the -- how we work, but also to have a good relation and long-term relationship with the different suppliers that we work with.

Daniel Morris
Head of Investor Relations

Thanks, Jakob. Moving to the next question, please. The next question is going to come from the line of Andreas Joelsson at DNB.

Andreas Joelsson
DNB Carnegie, Research Division

Moving from the splendid operations to the buybacks perhaps. And if we assume that you make SEK 25 billion in free cash flow on a sustainable level, that is equal to the total remuneration to shareholders. So should we say that around SEK 45 billion is a net cash that you feel -- that you and the board feel is needed for the -- to run the operations?

Lars Sandstrom
Senior VP, Head of Group Function Finance & CFO

I think as we mentioned there, the view is that it's important to have a solid net cash position. And we're coming out here with SEK 61.2 billion in net cash and the total distribution of around SEK 25 billion. And adjusted for that, we have given the business outlook that we see now, we see that it is a solid net cash position coming out of 2025.

Then when we come to next year, then we will have a look again, of course. But the capital allocation principles are there and that is guiding us also going forward.

Borje Ekholm
President, CEO, Head of Segment Enterprise & Director

And when you think about the business outlook, of course, you need to think about geopolitics, you think about whether it's the question before, tight supply chain, for example. And all of these factors reaches the conclusion that, that was the right level now.

Andreas Joelsson
DNB Carnegie, Research Division

And just as a follow-up, is there any thinking from the Board and from the management, given what you said before about growing EPS that you could -- that you would like to have a more long-term buyback program and making sure that you can achieve that?

Lars Sandstrom
Senior VP, Head of Group Function Finance & CFO

I think this is the first time, Ericsson now announces buyback program. So it is clearly a part of the toolbox for the Board and the AGM and for the shareholders to decide upon.

Borje Ekholm
President, CEO, Head of Segment Enterprise & Director

Yes. I think you would also say, Andreas, that it's intentional that is launched as a buyback program and you also know the mandate for those are reviewed annually by the AGM. So this will be our hope and ambition and what is that this will be a recurring thing. Then the size will vary, of course, depending on how the outlook looks like.

Daniel Morris
Head of Investor Relations

Thanks, Andreas. Moving to the next question, please. The next question is going to come from the line of Sandeep Deshpande at JPMorgan.

Sandeep Deshpande
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

My question is on the market in mobile networks, overall. Has the market changed at all? I mean, we've heard about the EU restricting some of the high-risk vendors, but at the same time, you are seeing a greater price competition in Latin America. Maybe Börje, you can make some comments on how this market overall is playing out in the world given the geopolitical situation?

Borje Ekholm
President, CEO, Head of Segment Enterprise & Director

Yes. If you -- a way to think about it, Sandeep, is we look at this market for the last 2 decades, right, and it's been flattish. So we like to think or plan for that type of market outlook. If it gets better, then we have a strong cost competitiveness, we get operating leverage. If it gets worse, we need to review that assumption, right? But that's kind of the way we think about the business.

Then, of course, it varies what happens. So over the last few years, and I think we spoke about this a couple of quarters ago that we saw increased competition in Latin America, we see it from time to others in other parts of the world, Southeast Asia, Africa, et cetera. So that kind of comes and goes a bit.

The thing that could be a positive is, of course, the high-risk vendor discussion in the EU. That's a sizable opportunity. If you think about the -- it's -- I mean we don't know exactly, but call the high-risk vendor market presence in Europe to be 1/3 to maybe up to 40%, but around that as a guideline, that would be a sizable revenue opportunity for trusted vendors.

So that could change. At the same time, it's -- now it's a proposal. It has to go through the process. So this is something that's probably going to take 12, 18 months before we really know the impact. So we're not factoring that in. But of course, it is an upside opportunity. And of course, it is, I would say, the toolbox, the EU discussed or implemented quite some time ago, which is 5, 6 years ago, has been not been widely adopted. So it is a change in stance with the current proposal.

Daniel Morris
Head of Investor Relations

Thanks for the question, Sandeep. Moving to the next question, please. The next question is coming from the line of Sébastien Sztabowicz at Kepler Cheuvreux.

Sébastien Sztabowicz
Kepler Cheuvreux, Research Division

On Networks, how do you see the mix trending in the coming quarters? We are now seeing some stronger growth in Africa, Southeast Asia and lower deployments in the U.S. and maybe also in Japan and Korea. So just curious about the mix trend in Networks. And also at a broad level what would be the puts and takes to your gross margin in the coming quarters? Where do you see some upside or downward pressure?

Lars Sandstrom
Senior VP, Head of Group Function Finance & CFO

I think single quarters will vary. But if you look a little bit on the underlying for '26, North America on healthy investment levels in the market. So -- and that we expect to continue during the year. And then when it comes to growth opportunities, there is an investment need in India and also in Japan, where we have also in both these markets, ensure that we have a good, solid market position.

So when the customers decide to invest, we should be able to capture on that. Europe, rather stable. And then there are -- we will see what happens in Latin America. There is opportunities there, but still quite tough competition for sure, parts of Southeast Asia as well. So I think that's a little bit the balance act.

In Africa, we have had a couple of good quarters now with 4G and 5G rollouts and modernization activities. And hopefully, we can see that continue also going into this year. So that's a little bit the balance act on the market mix. And then the puts and takes, there is a cost pressure in the group, in the flat RAN market and continuous cost pressure on us both in the people part, but also in material cost so that we need to continuously work with.

That's why we talk about then somewhat higher elevated levels on restructuring, both -- that will impact both, so to say, OpEx, but also in the cost of goods sold. So that is necessary to offset this upward pressure on costs. So that is some of the puts and takes. Then you have the normal product mix, but that will vary between quarters as always.

Daniel Morris
Head of Investor Relations

Thanks, Sébastien. Moving to the next question, please. Next question is going to come from the line of Felix Henriksson at Nordea.

Felix Henriksson
Nordea Markets, Research Division

It's relating to IPR. I think in the report, you called out that you had a contract expiring with the Chinese smartphone vendor at the end of 2025. So I just wanted to ensure whether or not there are other significant contract cliffs in 2026 that we should be aware of? And as a quick follow-up to that, what is your level of conviction in being able to grow the SEK 13 billion annual run rate in IPR going forward?

Lars Sandstrom
Senior VP, Head of Group Function Finance & CFO

Yes. Normally, we try to give you that guiding point around the run rate coming out of the year, around SEK 13 billion. When it comes to the contract, this is not a major impact. And we always -- when we negotiate, renew contracts, we are targeting the best economic outcome and that we will do as well this time. So that could be some impact here, but that is then normally coming back with a renewal. So it should not impact the full year, so to say.

And then potential upsides are there. We are in settlement negotiations with one of our licensees. So that is hopefully coming into place this year. And then there is the underlying opportunities around the pure smartphones when it comes to IoT, automotive, et cetera, that should support growth coming into this year as well. So that's a little bit the balance -- the pieces that will drive some opportunities.

Daniel Morris
Head of Investor Relations

Thanks, Felix. Moving to the next question, please. Next question is going to come from the line of Ulrich Rathe at Bernstein.

Ulrich Rathe
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

My question is on the bigger picture of the revenue outlook. So you're guiding for a flattish market and highlight the growth opportunities in mission-critical and other areas. And now in the fourth quarter, you delivered mid-single-digit organic growth, which is taken with some excitement in the market today. Would you go as far as saying that something like mid-single-digit revenue growth is possible in a flattish run market with the growth opportunities in these new opportunity areas that you're highlighting? Or is this maybe a bit of a phasing effect here? I think you highlighted in particular in CSS, the delivery phasing. Just wondering what your bigger picture here is?

Borje Ekholm
President, CEO, Head of Segment Enterprise & Director

I think to -- if you think about it from a little bit longer-term perspective, and it's going to fluctuate, right? But the size of the mission-critical market and the enterprise opportunity as well as 5G core that contributes here, 5G core, by the way, you should remember, it's only about 1/4 of all networks that are upgraded to stand-alone today, so there is a rather sizable opportunity there. So when you look at those outlooks, those individual pieces, they are large enough to a drive pretty nice long-term growth. It's not going to be double digits, as you say. So that -- take that out, but it may be low- to mid-single digits.

And I think the -- that's what makes me a bit excited is actually to think about it from that kind of at least some basic growth and you add on operating leverage on that, you add on what we're seeing on the enterprise that we're going to get that to profitability and you combine that with share buyback, you actually get a very healthy growth profile. So I think there is something here that I think from a little bit longer-term perspective is rather exciting.

Daniel Morris
Head of Investor Relations

Thanks, Ulrich. Moving to the next question, please. Next question is coming from the line of Sami Sarkamies at Danske Bank.

Sami Sarkamies
Danske Bank A/S, Research Division

I have a question on your silicon strategy. Your competitor recently announced that they will start building products based on NVIDIA chips. We have also done some R&D work related to the use of chip use. What is your take on the situation? And do you see a role for NVIDIA in future RAN products?

Borje Ekholm
President, CEO, Head of Segment Enterprise & Director

We selected a strategy several years ago to basically disaggregate the software and hardware and actually allow our software to run on pretty much any architecture. And of course, here, we can run on, of course, the x86, but it can run on GPUs. It can run on our proprietary Silicon as well. And by the way, you could well see the TPU from Google. You could see what Qualcomm is coming with AMD, et cetera. So we wanted to be a bit independent of the selection of the hardware layer.

The reason for doing that was that we felt it was the right strategy to give the customers the opportunity to choose what hardware layer they want to run on. And you know today, there are operators rolling out cloud RAN. That's on x86. In the future, it may be different. So I think the -- I cannot comment on Nokia's decision, that's for them to comment on.

But from my point of view, I -- we wanted a very different strategy, not to select the infrastructure layer today, but rather do that as we come closer towards AI RAN realization and 6G, then we can make an intelligent choice together with our customers. And we feel good about that strategy, but that also means that we're going to continue to work with the x86 ecosystem and the GPU ecosystem.

Daniel Morris
Head of Investor Relations

Thanks for the question, Sami. Moving on to the next question, please. The next question is going to come from the line of Didier Scemama at Bank of America.

Didier Scemama
BofA Securities, Research Division

Sorry to come back to the point on memory and cost inflation. So I'm looking at your inventories, which are seasonally lower in Q4. You seem to suggest that you are -- you have adequate supply from new suppliers. So just can you elaborate a little bit? Have you signed like a 12-month supply agreement that makes sure that the pricing is not going to be a headwind to your gross margins? And -- or put it in a different way, what have you assumed in your gross margin in terms of cost inflation from memory over the course of '26?

Lars Sandstrom
Senior VP, Head of Group Function Finance & CFO

I think margin -- inventory levels are coming down in the fourth quarter following the seasonality that we have, and that includes all inventories. So when it comes to that part, I think we are well positioned coming into the year when it comes to inventory levels on this kind of areas. Then of course, there is cost increases coming that we need to work with. But we don't share exactly how much that is, of course. But it will have some impact, but we will work together with our customers to ensure that we are, so to say, not stuck in the middle here, but there is an understanding that there is some sharing to be done here.

Didier Scemama
BofA Securities, Research Division

And sorry, again, to go back to the defense point, I think you sort of said, look, with the opportunities. Can you give us a sense of the size of your business today in defense? What sort of costs you're thinking about? Does that require any CapEx? Just elaborate a little bit so we've got something to work with.

Borje Ekholm
President, CEO, Head of Segment Enterprise & Director

Yes. I think you can assume -- we're not going into details exactly what our business is because we're working with a number of defense organizations. As you know, Ericsson exited all defense several years ago. So we haven't really had a presence. So today, we're working in partnerships as well as with defense organization.

So we're not going into details there. But -- and I think when you look at the overall sizing, the revenue opportunity, there are a number of consultants out there talking about the size of that opportunity. We -- and some are very big numbers. I'm not sure it's going to be that. But we think it's compared to the rest of the opportunity we have is sizable.

When we talk about it from an investment point of view, this is more saying that we will ramp up our presence in here and actually increase our investments. It's not going to be material compared to our overall SEK 50 billion we spent on R&D. So that's why we also say that it's part -- it can be -- well be offset, maybe not fully, but by the efficiency gains that we're going to do. So when you look at it from a total point of view, think about it as there is a big opportunity we will try to invest to get that. We're not going to materially impact our outlook with that. That's not the case. But we want to single it out as a growth opportunity.

Lars Sandstrom
Senior VP, Head of Group Function Finance & CFO

And I think on your question there on CapEx, it's very, very limited.

Borje Ekholm
President, CEO, Head of Segment Enterprise & Director

Yes, that's fair. That will be -- you will not see that as a CapEx need.

Daniel Morris
Head of Investor Relations

Thanks, Didier. Moving to the next question, please. The next question is going to come from the line of Daniel Djurberg at Handelsbanken.

Daniel Djurberg
Handelsbanken Capital Markets AB, Research Division

I have a question. If you could give any more color on the visibility in the North American RAN market in '26? Is it fair to assume a more back-end loaded year given some of your larger customers' spectrum asset holdings, for example, that could I expect to build upon in the latter part of the year?

Lars Sandstrom
Senior VP, Head of Group Function Finance & CFO

I think it -- we don't -- I think we say that when it comes to the full year, we are coming out with healthy investment levels, and we expect that to continue. Then how it will pan out between quarters, it's actually rather, I think, difficult to say. It depends on what the capital investment needs that they have in different rollout phases, et cetera. So it's -- I don't think it's today, easy to say what will be the difference between the first and the second half.

Borje Ekholm
President, CEO, Head of Segment Enterprise & Director

No I think that -- we don't guide that way, we've elected to do it quarterly and I think that's why we do it quarterly. What I -- I do think it's fair to say that when we look at the North American market -- and by the way, this is actually a global phenomenon. But when you will hear, I think our customers talk a bit about being cautious on CapEx, the interesting thing is we also see a change in mix in our customers.

So we believe we're -- the active components are going to be needed because that's driven by the traffic growth and the need to go 5G stand-alone as well as new use cases like fixed wireless access. So when you see that, you actually see, call it a healthy investment level, even though our customers most likely will guide for a bit lower CapEx without knowing they need to guide on their own, but it's given signals that you can hear and it's pretty clear, they will be cautious on CapEx.

Daniel Morris
Head of Investor Relations

Thanks for the question. Moving on to the next question, please. The next question is going to come from the line of Andrew Gardiner at Citi.

Andrew Gardiner
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Just coming back to a point you made earlier in your presentation regarding the performance that you've had over the course of 2025. Your profitability has improved noticeably last year. You've had 2 good years of operational cash generation. And so that is putting Ericsson, as you point out, in touching distance of the long-term financial targets.

That being said, these targets are some years old at this point. Are they still relevant and accurate targets for us to use in the market? Or given the changing state of your end markets and your strong execution, is there the possibility to do better, right? Do you have the ambition to perhaps outperform those somewhat old targets at this point?

Borje Ekholm
President, CEO, Head of Segment Enterprise & Director

I think it's right that they're old. We have not succeeded at reaching them, so that's a fair comment. But I think the -- we should remember, we also set the targets in a different environment geopolitically as well as business mix, to be honest. So we set them when iconectiv was part of our portfolio, we set them in a very different political environment. I think we -- I'm not too fan of changing targets easily. So we want to make sure that we reach that 15% to 18% first. Once we're solidly there, then I think we can start to talk about is that the right target after that. But right now, I think it's a good measure of what we should achieve with the current type of business we have.

Daniel Morris
Head of Investor Relations

Thanks for the question, Andrew. We just have time for a brief follow-up question from one of the analysts before we close. So if we can bring Daniel back in, Daniel Djurberg, Handelsbanken.

Daniel Djurberg
Handelsbanken Capital Markets AB, Research Division

I would like to ask a little bit on the Cloud Software and Services. Sorry, if I missed the answer before. But could you help us to understand a little bit more on this impact of this large contract being in most -- in the quarter i.e., with the outlook comments on Q1 seasonality have changed to more of a similar view if the contract has been excluded in Q4?

Lars Sandstrom
Senior VP, Head of Group Function Finance & CFO

It's a good question. Now as we said, we are coming out strong in Q4 here with -- and as you know, we have lumpiness when it comes to project deliveries, which are -- if you look at the full year, we are up around some 6% organically in Cloud Software and Services. And I think that has been a good underlying growth that we have seen, supported by the core business, and that is what we see as a healthy level coming into '26.

Then, of course, if that single comment would bring us back to normal, I think that's a little bit -- it would, of course, bring us closer for sure. That is true. And then we should remember, I think you have all seen that, that we have a significant currency headwind coming in, in Q1 year-over-year as a comparison that you will see currency rates peaked somewhat in Q1 '25. So that headwind we also are facing here.

Daniel Djurberg
Handelsbanken Capital Markets AB, Research Division

Look forward to see you in Barcelona.

Borje Ekholm
President, CEO, Head of Segment Enterprise & Director

Lars Sandstrom
Senior VP, Head of Group Function Finance & CFO
