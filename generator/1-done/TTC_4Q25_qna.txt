Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research.

David S. MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

I want to start off by just asking a couple of questions around the guidance. The sales growth, 2% to 5%, Tornado is going to add a couple of hundred basis points. I'm guessing you got a couple of hundred basis points of pricing in there as well. The implication for volume is still, I guess, a negative outlook. Can you just kind of walk us through the individual lines of business and just talk about the volume expectations for next year, even if just anecdotally rather than quantitatively?

Richard Olson
CEO & Chairman

Yes. Sure. I can walk through a few of those. First of all, yes, you did point out a good portion of the growth on the top line is due to the Tornado acquisition. But organically, we also can see continued strength on the pro side with the underground business continuing to be strong. Golf will continue to be strong as we talked about in the prepared remarks. And really starting last quarter, but again, this quarter, we see the landscape contractor, particularly the true contractors, not as much the homeowner with acreage, but the true contractors through our Exmark brand, for example, really coming back strong and contributing to growth. We expect that to continue.

And on the residential side, this is an extraordinary cycle that we've gone through that started at the beginning of COVID. I think if you could just draw that sign wave, the point where it crossed the midpoint was really the middle of 2023, so we -- that homeowner business has kind of been in recovery since then. And we are at the right side of that curve on the way back, but the rate at which that happens really will be determined by things like consumer confidence, the macroeconomic environment, interest rates and so forth.

So we've built a little bit more muted expectations on that side. So it's really a combination of all of those things that is what we're looking at for next year. We've built in our best estimates. We've included the strong start to snow. But as that plays out through the rest of the season, that could be a positive for us if that trend continues. But we've worked everything into our guidance at this point. Does that answer your question, David?

David S. MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

Yes. If I could just maybe drill in on the residential level for a moment. You're guiding first quarter down high teens. I'm guessing, you're factoring in some kind of an improvement here because you're guiding to the full year down low single to mid-single digits. So I guess what do you see improving in residential in 2Q through 4Q? Are you expecting a restock in the channel to help you out there. Just maybe talk about how you're thinking about that guide improvement?

Angela Drake
VP & CFO

I was just going to jump in and say, yes, we're comping to 8% down in prior year, but we do expect some continued homeowner caution, as Rick mentioned, with the macro environment continues to be what it is. But we have seen continued progress on productivity and cost savings, which are going to help our margin a little bit. But overall, the snow, as Rick mentioned, could be favorable to us in residential as we've seen some -- we've got some encouraging signs helping us right now.

David S. MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

Okay. Maybe you could shift and just ask you a couple of questions around the AMP program. You've popped up the guide from $100 million to $125 million. So congratulations on the progress there. I mean, can you just talk about the source of the extra $25 million that wasn't in the first phase that you now see as being achievable? And do you need volume growth to get to that kind of performance?

Angela Drake
VP & CFO

Yes. Thank you for asking. We continue to be really excited about the AMP initiative that we started in 2024 and did raise that target to have full run rate savings by the beginning of F '27 to $125 million. We're going to see that savings continue to come from the work streams that we have talked about initially. And those are really supply-based design to value route to market. And then our operational efficiency.

We made significant improvement in F '25, and we'll continue to see -- it just achieved better results than we expected to through F '25 and so the momentum, we're going to continue to see that go forward. And we don't believe we need increased volume to get that. We've got a lot of engines working in that initiative right now and want to continue on that momentum.

David S. MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

And initially, you had thought you'd take 50% of the gains to the bottom line, the other 50% would be reinvested. Could you just update us on where you are with that as of today? And how that target might change, revolve with the increase in the goal to $125 million?

Angela Drake
VP & CFO

Sure. Yes. We really expect to continue the same and reinvest up to as much as 50% of that. We probably had to over-index a little bit on the investment in the last couple of years, especially in F '25 just due to the headwinds that we saw with tariffs, inflation, some transition expenses with some of our product moves and network optimization.

But what we did continue to do is also take some of those funds and reinvest in innovation and technology to set ourselves up for future growth. So we would expect to continue to see that savings be somewhat reinvested up to the 50% level, but, we have realized $75 million of those savings in F '25 and through the program to date, almost $80 million.

David S. MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

Great. Great news there. Last question for me, just how you're thinking about raw material costs for '26?

Angela Drake
VP & CFO

Yes. So from our raw material costs, we expect to see some inflation early in the year, maybe kind of settling out about midyear. But overall, we built all of those things to the best of our ability into our guidance.

Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Wilson from Raymond James.

Joshua Wilson
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

First, could you run through the different product categories and give us a sense of where channel inventories currently stand?

Richard Olson
CEO & Chairman

The -- I think we could go through each segment. But just overall, I would say, especially relative to the commentary for the last couple of years, we're in good shape from a channel inventory standpoint. Residential, it's very much tied to the earlier comments about how that flows this year and the rate of recovery. But really across the board, we are in good shape from a field standpoint. That helps us, for example, when we talk about snow, but field inventory is in a good place.

So we should see the benefit of snow plays out. We really saw the benefit of that in the fourth quarter where our -- especially our commercial contractors, we're seeing the outlook for snow and started to order because field inventory was in a better position that directly translated into orders for us.

On the underground side, we're back closer to a better healthy position there, slightly lower than it should be. And the rest of the business, I would say, businesses, I would say, is -- are in normal range. If you took an individual model here and there, it would be plus or minus from where we'd like to have it, but much closer back to normal operating with field inventory. So we're in good shape with field inventory. It's been a lot of work by a lot of people to make that happen, but we're in good shape today.

Joshua Wilson
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

That's good to hear. And I know you said your lead times have normalized. Could you give us a quantification of where your backlog was in the year?

Angela Drake
VP & CFO

Yes. We actually had backlog improved by $400 million year-over-year. We typically give those results at the end of the year. And last year, we were sitting at $1.2 billion. So had a $400 million improvement in backlog.

So overall, we feel like we're in really good shape. It's probably even still a little elevated to where we thought we would be at this time last year. But very strong demand continues in golf and grounds, underground construction and in our other businesses. And one of the key points there, I think, is that our lead times have come in. So folks may not be ordering and putting their orders on as far out as they once were, because just as a reminder, that is really all open orders at a point in time.

Richard Olson
CEO & Chairman

I'm sorry, just -- just piling on what Angie said, it really reflects our improvement in lead time. So we're -- lead times in some categories that were around 2 years, we're now able to deliver more closer to normal, historically, 60, 90 days type of period. So the confidence we're gaining back the confidence of our customers to be able to order when they need it.

Joshua Wilson
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

And then looking at the 26% margin guidance for Professional of 18.5% to 19.5% versus the 19.4% you just reported, what are the positives and negatives that are leading you to that range year-on-year?

Richard Olson
CEO & Chairman

Yes. On the positive side, some of the same benefits that we've seen from AMP that we've talked about, some of that will be offset with mix that isn't quite as strong in '26 as it was in '25, and that just has a lot to do with which product lines. We prioritize the production and ultimately shift to the field.

Angela Drake
VP & CFO

And then the other thing I would add is just the addition of Tornado. So we will see some top line growth from Tornado in the professional segment. However, it is not being fully accretive to the operating margin in the first year just due to acquisition costs and transaction costs. However, it is accretive to EBITDA.

Our next question comes from the line of Ted Jackson from Northland.

Edward Jackson
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

I have a couple left. Congrats on the quarter, first of all. Yes. I mean, I want you to know that I own two Toro snow blowers and they've been getting heavy use so far this year. Heavy use. So first of all, the performance, you had a step-up in incentive comp this year. I mean that's a good problem to have. When you look at your guidance for '26, what are your assumptions around incentive comp? And how does that compare to '25?

Angela Drake
VP & CFO

Yes, great question. That was a change as you look at Q4 year-over-year, our corporate expenses were a bit higher because of the easy comp that we saw in F '24 because of incentives being restored. We have built back in normal incentive plans for our F '26 plans. So those coming back in at a normal rate, which they have not been -- were not over the past couple of years.

Edward Jackson
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

And what would like if we're to say like a normal rate, like, I don't know, some kind of percentage. Like, how would you define that just to kind of give us a baseline?

Angela Drake
VP & CFO

Well, we typically try to budget those or build those into guidance at 100%. So that is -- whatever those incentive targets are, that would be 100%.

Edward Jackson
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. And then I'm just shifting over to tariffs. I mean you provided some good color with regards to your expectations of their impact for this coming fiscal year and then what you -- what you've seen in the last few fiscal years.

As you kind of look through those assumptions, maybe give some highlights in terms of what's driving that and where you might see any kind of areas that could -- you could further mitigate that impact and what that might be? And then just how -- given how fluid tariffs have been over the last year, maybe just the confidence level you feel with regards to that outlook? And that's it for me.

Richard Olson
CEO & Chairman

Yes. Maybe just overarching, first of all, we've had a very focused team working on tariffs since the latter part of 2024 anticipating tariffs. And throughout '25, as we mentioned in the remarks, we were able to offset the effect through productivity strategic moves and through selective price increases to be able to offset.

As we look forward, so in 2025, we have a total of about $65 million in tariffs. That included '20 to '25 that were there all the way back to 2018. If we look at the same number for 2026, that number is about $100 million. And it really primarily reflects a full year of the tariffs that we experienced in 2025 plus a small factor of a few additional tariffs. If you break that down for 2026, it's roughly 50%-ish, a little bit more than that is 232 primarily steel and aluminum tariffs.

The second largest category would be China-related tariffs. And we have a small exposure to China. We systematically reduced that exposure since 2018, but still due to the size of the tariff, it's #2, but it's somewhere in the 15%, something like that. The remainder are general tariffs across different countries, the reciprocal tariffs. So that's kind of how it breaks down.

With regard to variability of tariffs, we will be making sure that we understand the 232 and some of the details of how those are calculated, making sure that we're accurate and optimized, mitigate those to the best of our ability.

And then part of what you mentioned, Ted, in terms of the unknown of tariffs is built into our guidance. So we -- it is reflected that there could be variability. We don't have the worst case built in. We don't have a best case built in either, but it is reflected in the way that we've guided for next year.
