Jeffery Watts
President & Chief Sales Officer

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Fastenal's Fourth Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. Now before we get started, I do want to take a moment to thank the Fastenal Blue Team and our employees across the world for their performance and dedication both this quarter and throughout the year. Your commitment and attention to customer needs have played a major role in making 2025 such an exceptionally successful year for Fastenal. So for that, thank you very much.

Now let's jump into our results. Now Fastenal delivered a strong fourth quarter capping an impressive 2025 recovery. We achieved double-digit growth in Q4 with daily sales up just over 11%, and we continue to gain market share despite a sluggish industrial economy. This marks our second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, but our success is not just about favorable comparisons. It's driven by continued progress on our strategic objectives and they start with increasing our sales effectiveness.

And we're winning with key accounts and new contracts. Our focused sales strategy is yielding share gains, we're signing more national and global contracts and we're deepening relationships with existing large customers. In 2025, our total contract customer count grew by 241 or just over 7%, reflecting solid new customer signings and expansions. These partnerships with big customers are core driver of our growth. When we think about enhancing our services, we've continued to expand our suite of value-added services, particularly our digital on-site solutions. In 2025, we significantly grew our installed base of FMI devices and strengthened our digital footprint, which combines our e-commerce, industrial vending and bin programs.

But by focusing and investing in these platforms, we're improving the customer experience and increasing retention. In fact, nearly half of our Q4 sales were transacted through FMI technology or other digital channels, really underlying how crucial these services have become to our customers. Now this is a key competitive advantage for Fastenal, and it makes us stickier with our customers and more operationally efficient. It also provides our customers with ongoing insight regarding product consumption, insight we're uniquely able to provide in a wide range of locations.

And then lastly, expanding our market reach. During Q4 and really over the course of the year, we continue to win new sites, new markets and we strengthen our presence in manufacturing, construction, government and the transportation sectors. We've also continued to grow the range of services and products we delivered through our solutions suite. Now thanks to these strategic efforts, Fastenal's Q4 financial performance, it was strong. We grew net sales to $2.03 billion in the quarter.

Like I said, an increase of 11% from Q4 of last year. The top line growth, combined with disciplined cost management, led to strong bottom line results. Q4 net income increased 12.2% year-over-year to $294.1 million, with earnings per share of $0.26. For the full year of 2025, we achieved record annual sales of $8.2 billion, up close to 9% versus '24 and net income of $1.26 billion, up 9.4%. We also generated robust cash flow and improved our operating margin slightly in 2025 even as we invested in growth and technology.

Now even more important, we accomplished this while maintaining a balanced approach to pricing and cost. In Q4, we saw pricing contribute roughly 310 to 340 basis points of our sales growth and pricing actions that helped to offset inflationary pressures but still kept us essentially neutral on price/cost for the year, but Max will be touching a little bit more on this later in the deck.

We also leveraged our operating expenses. For example, SG&A as a percentage of sales declined to 25.4% in Q4 from 25.9% a year ago. Now this cost discipline, along with volume growth, allowed us to improve our operating margin year-over-year despite a dip in gross margin due primarily to timing factors. The bottom line is that we're controlling what we can control, pricing, costs, capital allocation, to deliver more profitable growth.

Now turning to Slide 4. Now this momentum with our customers is clearly reflected in our site growth metrics for Q4. The number of active $50,000-plus sites rose 14% year-over-year, and those ultra-high spend sites now account for just over half our revenues. And we also saw solid growth in the $10,000-plus customer category, which was up roughly 8% to just over 11,700 sites in the quarter.

Now these figures demonstrate that we're growing with our largest and most strategic customers, exactly what we're focusing our efforts on. At the same time, though, we did see a decline in account of the smaller customer sites, the under $5,000 which was not unexpected. But I do think it's important to point out that we did see growth in our $2,000 to $5,000 customer sites, but 94% of the under-$5,000 decline was in the under $500 per month customer sites and almost 55% came from the under $100 customer sites for the year.

And our strategy deliberately emphasizes key account growth and driving deeper engagement at large accounts with significant spend potential rather than chasing low-volume transactional business. Now this strategy is paying off in higher growth, more resilient performance against a weak backdrop and really more efficient focus on our sales talent.

In manufacturing end markets, for instance, our heavy and other manufacturing customers, they grew at double-digit rates in Q4, far outpacing general industrial production. We're winning with big manufacturers because of our service model, including the FMI technology and on-site service and our extensive product range that really creates value for them. Likewise in construction and other segments, our focus approach, it's led to share gains where competitors are just more constrained. Now we're going to continue to develop these customer partnerships and expand the Fastenal footprint of customer sites as it's a proven formula for sustainable growth.

Now on to Slide 5. So this slide highlights how our investments in technology are contributing to our performance. Now Fastenal has long been a leader in industrial vending. We continue to expand those capabilities while also showing great progress on our key business, further strengthening our bonds with customers and also enhancing our efficiency. In Q4, we installed thousands more FMI technology devices at customer locations. We signed over 5,900 weighted FMI devices in the quarter and that signing pace was slightly below the exceptionally strong Q4 of last year but was still roughly 14% above our 5-year average signing rate.

And for the full year of '25, we signed approximately 25,900 devices and as a result, our installed base of active FMI devices grew 7.6% year-over-year to about 136,600 units. We have a great team leading these initiatives and our capabilities keep getting stronger. Now the impact on our sales is significant, though. In Q4, 46.1% of our sales were dispensed or managed through FMI technology, and that's up from 43.9% in Q4 of last year. So nearly half of our Q4 revenue flowed through Fastenal vending or bin device at a customer site. This is a powerful indicator of really how deeply embedded Fastenal has become our customers' daily operations. And it creates a sticky relationship, and this is a key part of our long-term growth model. The more we integrate with customers through on-site and digital solutions, the more indispensable we become.

Our digital footprint, it extends beyond physical devices as well. We offer a robust suite of e-business solutions from EDI integrations with large enterprise customers to our e-commerce web platform. In Q4, our e-business sales grew at 6.4% year-over-year. E-business now accounts for about 30% of our sales, 29.6% actually in Q4 to be exact. But when you combine e-business and FMI, which together form what we call our digital footprint, now these digitally-enabled channels represent 62.1% of total Q4 sales.

Over the past decade, we've steadily grown this number, now roughly 2/3 of our business come through this high-tech efficient channel. And the remaining 1/3 is really through via -- through traditional branches and direct sales which are still very important, but the trend is clearly toward a more digital and connected service model. And overall, for the year, Fastenal gained market share. We grew much faster than the industrial sector, and we strengthened our foundation for years ahead. Now we closed out the year aligned as an organization with strong momentum, thanks to our focus on customers and hard work of our people. I'm really incredibly proud of our team's dedication and the trust we build with our customers.

Now with all that said, I'm pleased to introduce our new Chief Financial Officer, Max Tunnicliff. As many of you know, Max joined Fastenal in November, and this is his first earnings call as a CFO. Max, he brings a tremendous amount of experience and fresh perspective to our finance and leadership team. And with that said, Max, welcome aboard and the floor is yours.

Max Tunnicliff
Senior EVP & CFO

Thank you very much, Jeff, and I'm excited and thankful to be part of this team. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our business and market trends, our fourth quarter results as well as a few points about where we're thinking on 2026.

Let's start with the business trends and market drivers slide. Looking at the broader operating environment in the fourth quarter, the U.S. economy continued to send mixed signals, especially in the industrial sector. While some areas showed resilience, others faced continued headwinds that impacted demand and supply chains. U.S. PMI and industrial production remained mixed in Q4 with heavier manufacturing segment showing relative weakness. PMI average was in the low 48s for the quarter while industrial production was close to flat compared to last year, although with some improvement late in the quarter.

Despite the softness, as Jeff mentioned, our daily sales rate remained strong in Q4, up slightly over 11%. This growth was driven by several factors: new customer wins, increased share of wallet with existing customers and our continued focus on operating more effectively overall. Importantly, customer sentiment remained favorable even against the backdrop of trade and tariff uncertainty that has characterized much of 2025. As in prior years, the timing of the December holidays had a meaningful impact on our Q4 results.

Just like last year, Christmas and New Year's fell midweek, resulting in a similar pattern of extended customer shutdowns and compressed shipping windows. This led to, for a second year in a row, below normal sequential growth in December as many industrial customers paused operations for longer stretches around the holidays. Sales to our manufacturing end markets outperformed other markets on a relative basis, led by growth in key accounts.

Other segments such as construction, education, health care, transportation and data centers also saw positive momentum. Our fastener product line growth outpaced non-fastener categories again this quarter. This was driven by several factors: successful signings of large customers, improved product availability due to strategic and thoughtful inventory investments and targeted pricing actions that balanced competitiveness with profitability.

Turning now to pricing. Our approach during the fourth quarter remained disciplined and responsive to the market. We implemented targeted price adjustments across select product categories, bringing our year-over-year price increase impact to approximately 3% for the quarter on matched product. These actions were designed to offset higher input costs, which they did while remaining competitive in a challenging environment.

We also continue to use data-driven pricing tools to identify opportunities for tailored increases, ensuring we maintained customer loyalty and minimized volume attrition. To summarize this slide, while the macro environment remained unpredictable, our diverse customer base, our focus on key accounts and specific strategic initiatives allowed us to capture growth opportunities and strengthen our market position.

Now I'll move to our margin performance and driver slide to talk about profitability. Gross margin decreased 50 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to last year, driven by timing elements within our cost of goods sold. These timing factors included the relief of certain inventory-related working capital which caused related cost to move through the P&L more heavily in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the timing of supplier rebates negatively impacted gross margins. It's important to note that these effects do not indicate a change in our underlying cost structure.

Related to tariffs and pricing, our net price/cost impact was nearly neutral for the quarter, coming in at 10 basis points negative. Our teams actively manage tariffs and input cost to defend the profitability using a combination of data analytics and sourcing strategies. Throughout the year, our fastener expansion project was our largest positive contributor to gross margin, allowing us to maintain flat gross margin levels year-over-year on a full year basis. This project will anniversary in the second quarter of 2026. As a reminder, this project did a number of things. It helped us capture higher-margin business and it drove cost savings initiatives such as price negotiations, consolidating purchases with preferred partners and optimizing sourcing. These actions directly reduced costs and increased efficiency.

The benefits from the fastener expansion project mitigated the dilutive effect on gross margin of the ongoing shift toward larger customers. As discussed in the past, these accounts tend to generate higher volumes, but at lower gross margin rates. We're comfortable with this trade-off as these relationships provide long-term stability and open doors for cross-selling and deeper integration and the negative impact at the gross margin level is offset at the operating margin level through efficiency gains and cost leverage.

Regarding 2026 gross margin, please remember that our fastener expansion project will anniversary after Q1. And so the modest annual gross margin contraction that we've seen historically should be considered in thinking about our 2026 performance. However, we believe this modest contraction will be offset within SG&A as we find efficiencies and further leverage our fixed costs.

Now back to 2025. SG&A was 25.4% of net sales in Q4 of '25 compared to 25.9% in the previous period. This demonstrates strong ongoing cost discipline as we more than offset the reload of incentive compensation and our ongoing investments in technology, analytics and sales support. In addition to our strong sales growth and disciplined expense management, we increased our return on invested capital by 90 basis points on a trailing 12-month basis, reflecting our approach to capital allocation and our commitment to maximizing asset productivity. In total, our performance demonstrates that we can invest for growth while maintaining a sharp focus on profitability even as our mix evolves, and we pursue larger, more complex accounts.

Turning to the cash flow and capital allocation slide. Operating cash flow was approximately $370 million, representing 125% of net income. Cash generation remains strong even as we added working capital to support growth, but on a more efficient basis year-over-year. Accounts receivable and inventory rose 8.7% from last year, reflecting our expanding customer base, growth with existing customers and our fastener expansion project. Accounts payable increased primarily due to inventory growth.

Net capital spending for 2025 was $230 million, which was 2.8% of sales with investments focused on strengthening our Fastenal managed inventory, or FMI, hardware capabilities, upgrading facilities, advancing IT infrastructure and expanding our vehicle fleet to support field operations and deliver efficiency. Regarding CapEx for 2026, we will increase our investments to support our growth expectations. We plan to invest in hub capacity, additional FMI device purchases and IT enhancements, with CapEx expected to be approximately 3.5% of net sales. These investments are designed to drive efficiency, scalability and customer value.

During 2025, we returned just over $1 billion in dividends for the full year, accounting for approximately 80% of net income, reflecting our confidence in cash generation and our commitment to returning value to shareholders. Overall, our capital allocation follows the same framework you've seen from us. We invest in FMI hardware and hub automation to drive throughput and accuracy. We invest in IT and digital capabilities to improve customer experience and sales productivity, and we invest in fleet and facilities to sustain service levels. We return cash through a consistent dividend, and we remain opportunistic on buybacks. Our balance sheet remains conservatively capitalized, preserving flexibility to continue investing in growth.

So in closing, I'll just summarize my portion before turning it over to Dan. In 2025, we delivered continued share gains through our key account strategy and new contracts, expanded our FMI technology and digital footprint and deepened our business in manufacturing and nonmanufacturing segments. Gross margin was protected mainly due to our fastener expansion and supplier initiatives, while operating margin benefited from disciplined SG&A management. We generated strong cash flow with capital allocation focused on growth, technology and shareholder returns. These accomplishments put us in a good position for continued success in 2026. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it to Dan.

Daniel Florness
CEO & Director

Thanks, Max, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining our call. Before I run through the CEO summary and recap on Page 9, just wanted to share a couple of thoughts. First off, for Jeff Watts, I suspect all of you saw the announcement we made in late December. I want to say congratulations to Jeff on being named our next CEO taking effect in July. Max, who you just heard from, congrats on being named Fastenal's CFO and welcome to the Blue Team.

Just to let Max get off to a calm start on his first earnings call and for Jeff to be CEO elect, we decided to do a different type of call. Some of you may have noticed that our scheduled earnings release date was yesterday, Monday, about 10 days ago, using that keen tool called the calendar, we realized we were releasing earnings that we had set up 1.5 years ago. We realized we had selected Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and the market would not be open, so we delayed it a day. The problem is that means Jeff is on his way to Europe, so he's sitting in Kitchener, Ontario. Dan had a commitment, and he's sitting down in southeastern United States and Max is by himself in Winona. So we hope the Q&A is not too jagged because we're not sitting in a room together.

With that said, from a market outlook standpoint, as Max touched on and Jeff touched on, the broader market conditions remain mixed. We see ongoing challenges in industrial production. Max did note possible uptick in industrial production during the quarter. In all candor, we haven't seen it in our numbers. However, we did see some signs of positive just from -- discipline by some of our suppliers. I'll touch on that in a few minutes, but if there's a green shoot or two that's popping up, we would welcome it. It'd be nice to have the market give us a little lift as opposed to the Fastenal organization doing it solo.

If I look at pricing neutrality and managing tariff impacts, we have continued to defend profitability through the year. Struggled a little bit with that in the fourth quarter and you see that in our numbers. It's really in the non-fasteners part of our business. As we talked earlier in the year and we were talking about how we're managing through the tariffs and the price/cost perspective, our covenant with our customer is we provide them a great resilient supply chain, great products, visibility to price, the cost in that supply chain. When there are things that drive costs up, our obligation to our customer is to let them know what we're seeing in their pipeline to help them plan for the future.

With fasteners, we are sourcing from the ultimate manufacturers, and it gives us a tremendous amount of visibility to manage that with our customer. As we touched on in our October earnings call with the non-fasteners, there's a piece where we have that same kind of visibility. However, there's a big piece where we don't. And that's where branded suppliers come into play, particularly in the fastener and cutting tool arena, where there's a much different dynamic in the marketplace.

And there was a question asked on the call last quarter about how we react to that and how we see that where suppliers really focus on SKU by SKU, what they're seeing based on the source supply of that part, the relationship works really well. Where customers -- where suppliers try to smooth that across their landscape of products, that's where it becomes more problematic, and our lead time is different.

So in the fourth quarter, we did feel a bit of a squeeze on that. And what I can tell you as we exit the quarter and move into the new quarter, a lot of things have been in motion in the latter half of the quarter. Things are in motion currently and they really center on a few things. One, from our supplier perspective, pushback like crazy, especially when the increase in cost we're seeing isn't intuitive to the known source of supply by geography. In other words, don't blend it across everything when you have products that aren't as tariff impacted as others, that's one. So pushback on the supplier base really hard.

Second is have frank conversations with our customers. And in that, we talk about this brand just raised their price x and having that frank conversation. And the third component is a really firm push towards product substitution where there's not willingness to move on price and the supplier's not willing to move on cost. So it's really balancing that. We have our work cut out for us. What I found in my 30-year career with Fastenal is I always bet on the Blue Team to perform in circumstances like this. As Max and Jeff also touched on, we have great momentum as we exit 2025, and we anticipate double-digit net sales growth in 2026 supported by FMI technology and digital solutions and feel really good about the momentum.

And I know there's some probably some consternation about some of the sequential patterns in the November and December. What I would tell you, regardless of the November and December sequentials being strong or weak, 30 years of experience in Fastenal has told me November and December don't matter. It's all about where we'll be in January, what did we grow to in the September, October time frame because that really tells me where we're going to start off the new year in January. And in that regard, we had incredibly strong progress throughout the year. October -- September, October was up double digit from where we were in January. Frankly, they were in the low teens from where we were in January, but January was a softer number. And feel really good about momentum coming into the new year.

From a financial discipline standpoint, really pleased with the way the organization managed our SG&A. And I'll say it this way, and this is how I shared it with the Board. A few of the analysts have talked about our shock absorbers in our SG&A, the incentive comp and how we reward for earnings growth. And if you read through our proxy, you could really see how that story works, and that thought process works throughout the organization. And so when I look at a year like 2024, our financial statements say our earnings were down $18 million.

That's really not the case. We delevered in 2024 and our earnings were down about $40 million, but our incentive comp compressed, and we funded 55% of that and only reported $18 million down. This year, if you look at the leverage in our business, our earnings on the financial statements say we grew about $145 million. That's actually not true. Our earnings grew just over $200 million, and we shared about 29% of that as our incentive comp expanded. So it really ate into our ability to get incremental margin in '25. We only have one quarter of that as we move into '26. So I feel really good about our ability, but my compliments to the Blue team on managing SG&A despite the fact we had a reload of incentive comp.

As Max pointed out, strong cash generation and our capital allocation is focused on growth, technology and returning to shareholders cash that we don't need today in the business because our cash generation capability is so strong. And I'm pleased to say our return on invested capital increased year-over-year by 90 basis points coming in at around 31%. From a priority standpoint, continued investment in tools, technology and analytics, focusing on operational excellence, our customers' experience and the innovation and employee engagement we can bring to the marketplace.

And finally, from a strategic progress standpoint, I think one thing Fastenal does really well and Jeff does particularly well is to our internal teams we point out the possible. If you think about Fastenal, we're really not an $8.2 billion organization. There's 240 districts within Fastenal that average around $34 million a year. We look at the business from the standpoint of those 240 business units and we see excellence and strength in that group, and we share the story with all that we see.

And what always is the growth differentiator from district to district is who has the best key account strategy. And we impress upon everybody, that's why our bucket reporting is so key. We impress upon everybody the importance of that. The -- and I'm really excited about the new customer site wins that Jeff talked about earlier in his talk. Finally, you see a sheet in there you've never seen before. This is an internal document, and you know Fastenal, we're transparent. We share internal documents with our investors.

This is how we think about the future. And as Jeff leads this next chapter of Fastenal, his challenge to the group is, what do we look like when we're a $15 billion organization and what do we need to do to achieve double-digit market share gains in the marketplace? So regardless of what the market is doing to push us, how do we push ourselves into the future? And it really centers on three key objectives: increasing our sales effectiveness every day, enhancing our service and expanding the total addressable market. Most of that is through geography and products, we'll see what possible things like services might influence that. You see a thing on there, Blue Ops/FASTCrib. We're not going to touch on that today but look for us talking about in the months and years to come, we see that as another leg growth driver for Fastenal in the future.

With that, we'll turn it over to Q&A.
