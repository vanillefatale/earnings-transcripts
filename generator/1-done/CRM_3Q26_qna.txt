[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.

Keith Weiss
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Congratulations on a really solid quarter. And also great to see you guys putting your money where your mouth is and the accelerated share buybacks, expressing your conviction in sort of the value of Salesforce's stock where it is. I had a question for Miguel and trying to sort of tap into your experience in talking to these large customers because there's still a very big mismatch in the marketplace in terms of what we hear from investors in terms of the expectation that generative AI is going to be injurious to the SaaS-based application layer that enterprise customers are going to try to build their own functionality, are going to try to replace solutions like Salesforce with DIY solutions that they could build around these models versus what we're seeing in the inflection in your business.

So can you talk to us a little bit about what you're hearing from customers and their appetite or desire, if they have one of building out their own applications versus going to a vendor like Salesforce to try to get to this generative AI functionality or capabilities?

Miguel Milano
President & Chief Revenue Officer

Keith, thank you so much. That's a spot-on question and it's the heart -- I think it's the heart of the matter. And I think there is a really different perspective on what is really happening. This past quarter, I was in 3 continents, 12 countries, I talked to 400 customers, many one-on-ones, many one-to-several dinners. And the reality is very different. There is something very large, very important, and I want to emphasize this. I don't think we've made Marc and Robin enough justice to what is happening right now in front of us. This is -- there is a new very large secular demand trend, which is the agentic enterprise.

Every single company in the world, small, medium, large wants to become an agentic enterprise, some -- a company that is conversational, that is much smarter, that empowers employees by giving them extra information that is able to execute autonomously, but also probabilistically on one side when AI wants to execute, deterministically when you want the current workflows to be executed.

And this is to increase growth, to reduce costs, to improve customer satisfaction and every customer wants to do it. Now the problem is they've been experimenting. They've been experimenting for 2 years. They've gone from experimentation now to frustration a little bit. And now they're all saying, you know what, this is hard. This is much harder than we thought.

And they all want to go to scale because the opportunity, which is a multitrillion, multitrillion market cap opportunity is in front of us. The TAM is multitrillion for them, for us, and they want to go all in. They know it's hard because LLMs cannot do this alone. And now to answer your question, the last mile is hard. And the last mile is hard because companies need the context.

For enterprise AI to be successful and accurate in the enterprise, you need the context, you need the data, you need the metadata, you need deterministic workflows. You don't want the agents to be essentially executing based on what they found in an LLM. You want the agents to execute in a deterministic way, the same workflows that, that company had already qualified in the apps for the years that humans are already using. And they need AI that is embedded where the humans are. That's why it's so important to have the data with the context, to have the apps, the deterministic workflows, to have the AI where the humans are and only Salesforce can do that. And we are seeing an incredible increase in demand ahead of us. We are winning. You're seeing the bookings. I'm very proud of the quarter that we delivered. I'm very thankful to my team, the whole employee base of Salesforce. I'm also very thankful to our customers, and I'm very thankful to our partners. Marc, do you want to add anything to that?

Marc Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

No, I think that was great. Thanks, Miguel.

Your next question will come from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.

Raimo Lenschow
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Miguel, can I stay on that subject a little bit. You've been expanding the sales -- your sales reps quite a bit, and that's still part of the plan. How do you think about the ramping of those? And how do you also think about productivity for those extra reps coming on?

Miguel Milano
President & Chief Revenue Officer

I have to credit Marc for that. We had a seminal moment a year ago where we, particularly Marc, he saw the demand coming. And he told us let's invest in capacity. Let's also invest in enablement. So I became, 6 months ago, also the enablement leader for the company. And we have now, today, 20% more capacity in place. We're going to finish the year with 15% more capacity enabled already. We call it ramped. This is fundamental. It takes 6 to 12 months to -- on average to ramp AEs. We've done all the hard work exactly at the moment that the demand is coming at us.

So I see the pipelines growing. The top of the funnel is growing. We've never seen a PipeGen quarter like we did in Q3 with essentially very healthy double-digit growth in PipeGen, above our expectations. Next year, pipeline -- open pipeline is, again, double-digit healthy growth on open pipeline, that matching the double-digit healthy growth on enabled capacity. It is very exciting. We are ready to capture the opportunity. And again, this is not just one more cloud that now we are very excited. Agentforce, Data Cloud is going to have 10%, 20% on the business that we do with every customer.

The agentic enterprise is a new paradigm. Customers will have -- will use Salesforce in a totally different way. They will use Salesforce to be the platform for digital labor, for sales, for service, for marketing and the impact on the way we can monetize those relationships is exponential. It's not linear growth. It's exponential. Robin alluded to that at the Investor Day. You were talking about 3x, 4x the ability to multiply the monetization on customers because, by the way, they're getting 3 or 4x or 10x more value from our products. I'm already seeing a lot of examples of companies that had a great relationship with us, had a multi-cloud relationship with us. Sales, service, all our core clouds, they were very excited. And then Agentforce and Data Cloud came. They decided to become an agentic enterprise.

They understood the last mile problem. They bet on Salesforce, and now the bookings that we do with them, the AOV had doubled, tripled, in some cases, multiplied by 4 and 5, and we are just getting started. We just want to get every single one of our 150,000, 200,000 customers through the agentic enterprise journey. And for each of them, there is going to be a multiplier effect.

Your next question will come from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.

Brad Zelnick
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And my congrats on an amazing quarter. Marc, at this point, even without Informatica and now more so with it, you have one of the largest infrastructure businesses in all of software, well over $10 billion in scale. What's Salesforce's competitive advantage in infrastructure? And how do you not only get credit for it in its own right, but leverage these core capabilities to drive the overall company's success?

Marc Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

Really appreciate the question, Brad. I think, number one, I just want to make sure everybody realizes we're not building data centers at Salesforce. We're preserving our gross margins and our cash flow. But we will use the data centers that are being built. And we will take advantage of the lower cost that we're seeing in the market from the incredible build-out of data centers. But yes, you're right. Our data infrastructure is incredible. We call it our data foundation. And I think you realize it composes, as I mentioned, 3 key things: Informatica, Data 360, our data cloud and also MuleSoft.

And together, you're right, I think it will do about $10 billion next year in business. So this is a very significant software business. But it's fundamental, it's key for every one of our customers to move to this data foundation. And we are still at the beginning of that journey with so many of our customers. And one of the keys to it is it's federation. And I just came back from Japan, as I mentioned. One of the most important companies in Japan other than Salesforce is IBM.

IBM has about 8,000 employees in Japan. We have about 4,000 employees in Japan. We have -- I think we're the largest software company in Japan right now. And the ability to federate Data 360 to the IBM Mainframe, which is technology that we just introduced in Tokyo 2 weeks ago at our world tour that idea that you're running Agentforce, but it is being fueled by not only the data and Data 360, but simultaneous the data in your IBM Mainframe. So that infrastructure is critical to delivering the AI that is accurate, that is reliable, that is low in hallucinogens. And this is fantastic for the company, and it is not something that is totally independent. It's deeply integrated with everything that we do. So all of our apps, Agentforce, our customer agents, our employee agents, everything is built on this fundamental foundation. I couldn't be more excited about it.

Your next question will come from Brent Thill with Jefferies.

Brent Thill
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Marc, the halo effect the Agentforce is having, I mean, it seems that sales and service were stable at high single-digit growth, Slack accelerated growth. Can you just speak to what you think this is doing for your other clouds and maybe even drill in on the Slack resurgence?

Marc Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

Well, you're right on it, Brent. I think that it's an accelerator on the core. And I think that we're -- to address the question that went to Miguel, where there was a false narrative that somehow the core is in jeopardy because of these large language models. And while the large language models are very important and they will expand in functionality, I'm sure, over time, the reality is that our ability to take our core applications, extend them and deliver another level of value beyond what we were doing before.

Now we had already been doing predictive AI and all the kind of Einstein AI. But now with Agentforce, it's another level, and you could see it really at Dreamforce when we're demoing Agentforce Service with the omnichannel supervisor and the ability for the agent and the humans to interact autonomously. That was just awesome because it's humans and agents and the apps and the data. And that, I think, is what is really driving this forward, and it's happening in sales, it's happening in service, it's happening in Slack. And I'm confident it's going to happen in marketing. It's going to happen in commerce.

It's going to happen across every Tableau, across every single product, every single product had to be rebuilt, so that took some time. I'd love for Srini to come and kind of talk about that. But now as we deliver those Agentforce products and you saw each and every one of them at Dreamforce, how far they are, customers are excited to get to that next level. Srini?

Srinivas Tallapragada
President, Chief Engineering & Customer Success Officer

And just to connect those 2 questions. If you really look at agents, agents need context, really, and they need tools. And what is context, to get context, you need data across the enterprise, some in the company, which is in the platform, some you want to federate it, which is what we call data copy and some through ingest, which is why Informatica is. You need to understand where all the data is in the company. You need a catalog. You need a master metadata. You need to organize all these data, and you need tools. This is what is enterprise context. Without having an enterprise context, it's very, very hard. And that's what our data foundation gives with Informatica, MuleSoft and Data 360. On top of that...

Marc Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

Srini, actually really drill into that because people still don't understand.

Srinivas Tallapragada
President, Chief Engineering & Customer Success Officer

So just so you know, just on ingest, for example, in quarter-over-quarter on Data 360, people have built their lake. Just in Data Cloud, our ingest has increased by 38%. At Zero Copy has increased by 52% growth in terms of records. But this is unstructured data. So it's just not the structured data. It's all your documents, all your knowledge articles, all your user manuals. That has increased by 109% growth. And then this is how you create this unified profile or unified product ID, unified customer master, unified account master. That's what the unified context you want in a real-time profile. That's very hard to do.

But just if you have this context, it's not enough. You need the deterministic place for reasoning, where deterministic, where non-deterministic. Then you need the tools to -- the agents have to take actions. Some of the actions are in Salesforce already, the jobs to be done over 25 years for each vertical, we have really deep understanding of not just a sales rep does. We know what a sales step does in a financial industry, different from what a sales rep does in a pharma, which is different from what a sales rep does in a telecommunications industry. So that's the jobs to be done.

Now imagine you need the context, you need the jobs to be done, you need the tools. And sometimes you have back-end systems where you need those APIs. That's why MuleSoft is very important. Now if you just think these 3 are enough, it's not enough because once you go live, you need an eval, you need to know how the agents are performing. You need auditing, you need compliance. You need local data residency tools.

This is what we are finding enterprises who did do-it-yourself are realizing that it's good news actually for me. When I talk to CIOs, I see 2 types. People who are really advanced who were visionaries who started 2 years back with do-it-yourself, they really understand the pain point. They are the ones who are moving fast to the platform. And then there are some people who still think they can do it, and we'll convert them over years. So I see people who have -- who know what it takes and so they know the day 2, day 3 problems and some people who still think.

So to do this, it was not easy, correct? You had to build a platform. So 4 years back, we started with a Hyperforce layer. Then we created a data layer. We had to pull the data lake, a lake warehouse that's what Data 360 was. We rebuilt the entire infrastructure on the platform, on the hyperscalers, we had to rewrite our entire metadata layer to do not thousands of records, but millions of objects. Then we had to rewrite all our applications. Our score sales. It's no longer a Sales Cloud, it's agent for sales. So because when I talk to Miguel, he doesn't just want a sale, he wants to transform his function into agentic sales function, and I run customer success.

So my job is not to do customer success. I want to write an agentic customer success. This is why help.salesforce.com is important. That's what you're seeing. So imagine each of these applications are changing. But this framework is hallowing another thing. When we started doing agent ITSM, normally it would have taken a long time. But because we had the foundation of the data layer, the Agentforce layer, the metadata layer, suddenly building an agentic ITSM became very easy and that's what you are trying to see the leverage. Same with Life Sciences Cloud. So we're not trying to build the regular way, but this took time. And now that we have this customer success you are seeing, this is what is going to make it a differentiator, and that's our promise to our customers.

One more right thing is our customers 2 years back, they would ask me, what model are you supporting? Where is it? What hyperscale you're on? They don't ask me any of those things now because we abstract all that complexity for them. That's the original promise of Salesforce when we said no software. Basically, that's what it is. We bring the customers to the future. We want to help our customers go to the agentic enterprise. And that's what we are doing.

And all our forward deployment motions with our own PS services, with our customer success team, also with our SI partners, heavily invested with Accenture, Deloitte, PwC and other global partners to really ensure that we also jointly partner with them and in a lot of places, we are co-selling them. We're having combined FDE training. And this together is what it takes to generate the agentic enterprise. And that's how all these points we are trying to tie together. Hopefully, that answers your question.

Your next question will come from Kirk Materne with Evercore Partners.

S. Kirk Materne
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Congrats on the momentum around Agentforce. Miguel, I think this one's for you. When Agentforce first came out, there was a lot of questions from partners, customers about pricing, just confusion, trying to get a handle on that. It seems with the momentum, people are more comfortable with that. And sort of the second part of the question is there's still a lot of concern among investors about as Agentforce helps customers maybe keep headcount stable or even lower headcount in certain areas, how does Salesforce monetize in that kind of situation? And I was wondering if you could just touch upon that a little bit because I think that would be helpful to people to understand how AOV grows even in, say, a stable or declining headcount situation.

Miguel Milano
President & Chief Revenue Officer

Yes. Thank you so much. Listen, Agentforce is at the heart of the agentic enterprise transformation. The momentum that we saw in Q3 is pretty significant. It's unheard of. It's beyond our expectations. And I want to differentiate between momentum on the bookings, okay? Bookings is one part of the equation. The hardest part of the equation is the adoption. Now on bookings, we saw the numbers of ARR, the 70% more customers in production.

I think there is one statistic that we haven't mentioned, which is very powerful. We said that 50% or more of the bookings came from customers refilling the tank. Robin alluded to that. But I don't know if you remember 2 quarters ago, I was super excited. I had to dig very deep to find that 3 customers came and refill the tank in Q1. In Q3, 362 customers refill the tank. That's an incredible testimony of the success that Agentforce is having in a very short time frame.

Now the other thing that we've learned is pricing matters. It's very complex. We've gone long ways. We've had different ways of pricing the product. And now I think we have the whole portfolio of different commercial frameworks to meet customers where they are, where they want to be. My favorite one, of course, is the extreme. Those customers that are really determined to become an agentic enterprise before their peers in their industry, they realize that the last mile is very hard. They know that Salesforce is the last mile with humans, with the apps, with the data and the context, they go all in with us.

And they ask Miguel, we don't want to be trapped here in 2 or 3 years because consumption, we used to have 10 different metrics, make it easy for us. And we went to them, and we tell them, "Listen, give me a flat fee, we'll give you -- we pull all the power, all the power of Salesforce, including FDEs from Srini, and we will deliver the agentic enterprise promise. We have actually a point of view for every industry that includes hundreds of agents that have already been defined. We have a database of agents with their roles, with their workflows that they have to trigger on how they configure them. And we have the Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 and customers just buy on an AELA.

We did 16 AELAs in agentic enterprise license agreement in Q3, we have about 100 AELAs in the pipeline, and all these are multimillion-dollar deals. And it is very exciting that it gives the customer the predictability that they need. Now there are other customers that are more cautious, and they -- I'm going to the other extreme.

Marc Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

Drill in on that. So here, we have this enterprise license agreement, we call the agentic enterprise license agreement. When we first started with Agentforce, we were talking about, oh, it's going to be so much per conversation. It was this type of pricing, may be transaction-based pricing, usage-based pricing, but customers have pushed for more flexibility. We've moved fast to that. How has that really hit the market, explain why that is so important for customers?

Miguel Milano
President & Chief Revenue Officer

Because -- Marc, good question by the way. You and me came up with the AELA concept when we visited a few customers in Europe from Unilever to PMI. We had great conversations. And we realized that they wanted to move. They wanted to transform, but they were afraid about all these metrics, consumption, et cetera. So we -- what we're doing now is very simple. We are putting the whole menu of options to them. We also have a very successful SKUs that we launched, which are Agentforce for sales or Agentforce for service that are seat-based SKU. People talk about seat-based versus consumption-based pricing. The reality is there are a lot of customers that want seat based because seat based gives you the predictability.

So we've sold a lot of seat-based licenses for Agentforce and Data Cloud in Q3. In fact, that SKU has doubled year-on-year. It's very massive success there. And -- but we also have customers from the beginning that they want to just pay per conversation or per agentic actions. So we have the whole portfolio, and we are meeting -- and I love the sentence that Robin illuminated me with a while ago is we are meeting customers where they are. Every customer is a different point of the journey. So pricing is not -- we put pricing away from the table. And by the way, we also have flex pricing.

If customers -- and now going to the second part of the question. If customers are worried, okay, I don't want to invest here too much because I already have my service agents in this -- in the call centers and my salespeople and what if that reduces, we have flex agreements where if you decide that -- because the future of agentic is human and agents working together. In most companies, humans are also going to increase.

But if they decrease in some areas, you redeploy them, but they may not need a license of Salesforce. Well, you can use that payment to Salesforce into credits, into an AELA or into a seat-based license. So we have the full flexibility. Now humans and agents, I think you guys always ask the same thing on whether the number of seats is increasing, the price is increasing. Well, for our core clouds, we are seeing both increasing, which is exciting. And we have the flexibility for customers if they want to move investment from one area to the other. So far, we are seeing that the power of the agentic enterprise is when agents augment humans and they work together side by side with humans.

Michael Spencer
Executive Vice President of Investor Relations

Great. Thanks, Kirk. Operator we'll take last question, please.

Operator

Your last question will come from Brad Sills with Bank of America.

Bradley Sills
BofA Securities, Research Division

Marc, a question for you. I remember at the analyst meeting that we had at Dreamforce, you referred to some efforts to kind of get back to the basics in the sales channel in pipeline. I think you had mentioned that there were -- the leads were there, but you weren't watering the leads or the seeds were there, you weren't watering the seeds. Would love it if you could elaborate on that effort to kind of focus back on kind of back to the basics lead generation, what impact that has had on the pipeline?

Marc Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

Okay. Well, I think that maybe this is our greatest accomplishment of the year. Of course, Srini has done a phenomenal job as well as Steve and the entire technology team in building Agentforce. There's no question, the product is more exciting than ever before. We went through this in detail today. But I think that probably the most exciting thing that we have done this year from my perspective is not only have we delivered this incredible piece of technology, but we've radically enhanced the capacity of the distribution organization at a level that we have not done in years.

This is very important, not for this year, but for the subsequent years. And this investment that we made this year in capacity is going to pay off across all 6 segments. I just want you to remember, Salesforce sells to companies, 0 to 200 employees, 200 to 1,000, 1,000 to 5,000, 5,000 above, the U.S. government and across our ecosystem or the software industry. And to really address all 6 segments, it's critical for us to have the capacity to do that. Miguel, what is your total capacity increase for the year so far?

Miguel Milano
President & Chief Revenue Officer

20 -- as of today, 23%.

Marc Benioff
Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO

About 23% capacity increase. And then we do 4 critical things. Not only have we delivered more capacity, we have, as Miguel said, trained them, enable them. Obviously, these concepts that we're talking about agentic enterprise, we've created this. We're envisioning this. We're defining what the future is with this. So we have to enable them and train and give them the ability to deliver that in every one of these market segments.

Number two, that core capacity, we have to look at that across every single one of those segments. Several of those segments are delivering mid-double-digit growth at a level that we have not also seen in years. Huge shock to us. And we really think that so many of these segments are just on fire and doing incredibly well. And then three is we have to link the compensation plans of these incredible sellers to these goals, all the goals that you've kind of heard as outlined in the script.

And the last thing is we measure the participation of each seller across each segment, across each geo, across every operating unit and find out why are they selling or why are they not selling this product in this geography in this segment. So it's a radical level of management. I would say that our ability to do that today far exceeds where we were even just 3 or 4 years ago.

And Miguel, I think, has done a phenomenal job in making that happen. And I think that when we're running the largest sales force in software industry, which is what we have, and the ability to deliver that across all of these segments with what I think is the most competitive piece of software we have ever had across every industry, every geography, across every segment, it's a Herculean task. And Q3, when you look at these numbers and you saw we were guiding, I think, that we were going to do 9% cRPO growth, then it went to 11% because Miguel crushed it. And I'm really excited about Q4, but especially, I'm excited about fiscal year '27 and fiscal year '28, because of the capacity increases that we're making now.

Michael Spencer
Executive Vice President of Investor Relations
