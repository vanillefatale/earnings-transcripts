Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Tim Mullen with Laurelton Management.

Timothy Mullen

I was just curious if you guys could share any thoughts on the regulatory environment, specifically in New York? And what impact in the years ahead do you think it could have on Star Gas, things like the fossil fuel ban and some of the other regulatory items.

Jeffrey Woosnam
President, CEO & Director of Kestrel Heat LLC

It's really just very difficult for us to try to predict how that regulatory environment is going to impact us as a business. And a lot of that is still in flux and some of those plans are still trying to being determined. So again, it just -- it's really difficult to comment on how that might impact us going forward.

[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Michael Prouting with 10K Capital.

Michael Prouting

Jeff, on the customer attrition, I just happened to notice -- so looking just at the fourth quarter, that looked like customer gains were down, customer losses were up. And then also, if you just look at the last few years, if you look at the net attrition for the year, it does seem like things are trending in the wrong direction. Was there anything specifically you think that affected attrition in the fourth quarter? And what are your thoughts about attrition going forward for the coming year?

Jeffrey Woosnam
President, CEO & Director of Kestrel Heat LLC

We're just generally seeing a low level of prospect activity in the marketplace, Michael. I would say for the full year because some of this is timing, but certainly for the full year, the encouraging part of it is that you can see that our loss rates as a percentage of our customer base are down and continue to come down each year, and I think they are really at historical low points.

And all of our -- as I've mentioned, all of our customer with internal customer satisfaction indexes are pointing in the right direction. So the overall impact of that is it's lower churn on the business. The challenge has been new customer gains. And that's something we're constantly reviewing. There's -- in part, as I mentioned in my remarks, we've seen a lower level of activity -- real estate activity, which just takes fewer prospects out of the market.

And I would also note that while fiscal '25 was colder than '24, it was still 8% warmer than normal, and we really didn't have a lot of disruptive weather in that period, which tends to attract prospects to our high-quality brands. So we're just constantly reviewing our sales and marketing structure and activities and to attract more customers to our brands.

Michael Prouting

Okay. And then I had just actually 2 other questions. Jeff, one for you on the acquisition front. I just wanted to get your color on how the pipeline looks at this point and whether you see the effect of any significantly large deals?

And I also had a question for Rich. So in terms of free cash flow, the K was not filed last night, although I have been going through it this morning. But I did happen to notice that free cash flow was lower than I would have expected in the fourth quarter. And it looks like that could be attributed to a combination of working capital tied up in receivables and inventory. And I was just wondering, especially with the inventory, if there was anything there like you guys got a really good deal on heating oil or just what it might have driven the lower-than-expected free cash flow in the quarter?

Jeffrey Woosnam
President, CEO & Director of Kestrel Heat LLC

Sure. Related to acquisitions, our pipeline is -- it remains active. We have a number of different opportunities currently under review. Nothing significantly sizable, several tuck-in opportunities, some smaller standalones, but we'll have to see how all of that kind of transpires and comes to fruition. But I'm very pleased with just the overall level of activities and transactions that we've been able to complete this past year. And really, when you think about it, 4 quality deals in 2025 and 4 in '24. So 9 completed acquisitions that we're very proud of over the last 2 years. But hopefully, we can continue that trend.

Richard Ambury
CFO, Executive VP, Treasurer & Secretary of Kestrel Heat, LLC

Yes, if you look at our receivables, I think we have the same -- relatively same day sales outstanding this year versus last year on our accounts receivable. I don't really see any big difference between our free cash flow this year versus last year. We're paying the same taxes. EBITDA was $3.3 million less this year versus last year. Interest is up a little bit. The timing of income taxes could be possibly impacting free cash flow. But it all depends, too, on the timing of some inventory coming in, barges this year versus last year.

And the way the cash flows work, it's a change versus the change in the prior year, but I don't see anything really impacting free cash flow or leading to possibly a distributable cash flow calculation because interest expense is up a little bit. Our cash taxes are not really all that much different. And interest expense is up a bit as well. And we didn't have any tremendous fourth quarter capital purchases this year versus last year, Michael.
