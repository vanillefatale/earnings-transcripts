Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Geoff Lowery from Redburn.


Geoff Lowery
Redburn (Europe) Limited, Research Division

It's not often that Inditex comments on markets, but you've used the interesting phrase of complex. Can you help us understand more exactly what you mean by that? Is it what you're seeing from the consumer? Is it a comment on supply chain or tariffs? Sort of just help us understand this a little bit more, please.


Gorka Yturriaga
Director of Investor Relations

Thank you, Geoff. No, I mean, when we are talking about market and challenging conditions, we're really talking about the market as a whole. So you think of, for example, the tariffs and the trade wars and the consequence of the FX swings that we've seen over the period. So we're really just highlighting that. In any case, what we are also liking to mention is the fact that as you've seen the performance of the group in the quarter and the resulting gross margin, which we think is a good reflection of the strong execution of the unique business model that we have, we've been able to somehow overcome all of those headwinds. Thank you.


James O'Shaughnessy
Senior Investor Relations Manager

The next question comes from Anne Critchlow from Berenberg.


Anne Critchlow
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

I had a question on Lefties because I believe it's stepping up expansion at this point. And I'm just wondering if there are any regions or countries where you think Lefties wouldn't be relevant and which countries and regions are the focus of store openings in the short to medium term?


Gorka Yturriaga
Director of Investor Relations

Great. Thank you, Anne. I mean with regards to Lefties, we've talked about the fact that it already has an international presence. It originated with more focus in its heritage markets of Spain, Portugal and also Mexico. Currently, it has presence in 18 markets, and we are testing Lefties in a series of other markets. We've also reported today, as you've seen in the note, that Lefties currently has 210 stores versus last year's store count, which was about 198 stores. So we're just growing as we are with all concepts with a lot of opportunities that we see on a project-by-project basis. Thank you.


James O'Shaughnessy
Senior Investor Relations Manager

The next question comes from Monique Pollard from Citi.


Monique Pollard
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

My question is just coming back to this point of the strength of the gross margin in the second quarter or stability over the first half. I guess, as you point out, given the headwinds from the tariffs, et cetera, that has come in quite a bit better than expected. Just wondered if you could talk a bit about what you have done to manage the tariff impact, if there have been some consumer-focused price increases in the U.S., negotiations with suppliers, et cetera.


Gorka Yturriaga
Director of Investor Relations

Thank you, Monique. Great. So with regards to tariffs, I think, first of all, I'd like to say that the current environment is difficult to predict, and we're, of course, continuously monitoring the situation, and it's quite fluid. We generally feel that as a company, we have 3 key tools at our disposal. And I think we've talked about this in the past. First of all, you have to consider that we are a global company and, therefore, we have a lot of experience with related to tariff regimes and changes of tariff regimes.

The second one is one point that we always highlight that we have a very broad-based diversification, both in terms of sales as well as in the sourcing. And I think this is a great advantage for us to manage all of these issues. And then finally, of course, the flexibility of the business model, which is also leveraged on that proximity sourcing that we always highlight.

I think that with regards to the tariffs in the U.S. specifically, we have a stable pricing policy that we're always talking about. And of course, all pricing activity, be it in the U.S. or any other geography is primarily driven by commercial decisions, not financial ones. And what we try to do in every market is maintain our relative position. So with all that in mind, we're quite confident with regards to the gross margin guidance for the year of plus/minus 50 basis points.

Senior Investor Relations Manager

The next question comes from Sreedhar Mahamkali from UBS.


Sreedhar Mahamkali
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I guess if you could talk a little bit about online versus stores. Clearly, last couple of years, online has been growing considerably faster than stores. Do you think that is to continue? And as a result of the space growth we see this year is a good proxy for the medium term as well, please?


Gorka Yturriaga
Director of Investor Relations

Great. Thank you, Sreedhar. As you know, we have a fully integrated business model. And the reason I mentioned this is because it's difficult to think of online growth without the physical store presence. So you really have to see it as a whole and not try to separate both channels as for us, really, we feel that it is one a consequence of the other. If you think of, for example, online sales without a store or store sales without online, it's difficult for us because of that fully integrated business model. I think what you should consider is that we continue growing and we see great opportunities of growth in both channels, in all markets and throughout all concepts.


James O'Shaughnessy
Senior Investor Relations Manager

The next question comes from Warwick Okines from BNP.


Alexander Richard Okines
BNP Paribas Exane, Research Division

Perhaps you could just talk a bit more about the growth in the Americas region in the half. And in particular, just going back to March 2023 when you said that you'd have at least 30 expansion projects in the U.S. over 3 years. Are you on track to meet that number?


Oscar Maceiras
CEO & Executive Director

Thanks for the question. Well, the growth of the group is broad-based across all regions and concepts. And as you know, in the U.S., it's a very relevant market for us, and we continue to see opportunities to keep on executing that strategy of selective growth in the market. In 2025, we remain very active in the U.S. In June, for instance, we relocated to a new flagship store in L.A., The Grove with significant more space and upgraded customer experience.

Some additional projects have already been executed, including another openings, Boston CambridgeSide Mall or relocations, New York Hudson Yards. More projects for the rest of the year will be new openings, Las Vegas Forum Shops at Caesars. Our new Zara Man stand-alone store in Costa Mesa. Or enlargements like Boston Newbury or Austin, Texas.

For 2026, we are planning very relevant initiatives, refurbishments in iconic stores like New York Fifth Avenue, new openings for instance, the 400 Post Street, our new flagship store in San Francisco or the opening of the store in Charlotte that will imply the opening of our state #26 with stores in the U.S. And of course, all of them combined with solid -- very solid performance of our online platform in the states. We keep on exploring new opportunities for sure in the market for our different formats. Thank you.


James O'Shaughnessy
Senior Investor Relations Manager

The next question comes from James Grzinic from Jefferies.


James Grzinic
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Congratulations. Just had a quick one. I appreciate your guidance around gross margin. But I was wondering, when I think about the timing of supply chain cost deflation, FX tailwind building on sourcing, product cost deflation, should I be thinking that these start property building in the current autumn/winter ranges that are hitting the stores now? I would be curious on your thoughts about that dynamic and the timing of that, please?


Gorka Yturriaga
Director of Investor Relations

Great. No, that's a good question. I think from our perspective, what we see is that, in general, the demand of our collection has always been driven by the ability of us to be able to execute the business model. And so that's how we're thinking about the second half of the year. I get your point with regards to, for example, FX, but you have to also consider that though we do have a sourcing in U.S. dollar, we have somewhat of a natural hedge on the sales side as well, which is what gives us a little bit of a confidence when we're talking about a stable gross margin of plus/minus 50 basis points. Thank you.


James O'Shaughnessy
Senior Investor Relations Manager

The next question comes from Richard Chamberlain from RBC.


Richard Chamberlain
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I just had a question on working capital, please. I wondered if you could just explain the drivers of the working capital outflow that you've seen in the first half in the cash flow statement, in particular, the change in current liabilities, it's an EUR 811 million cash outflow by the looks of it in the first half.


Andrés Sánchez Iglesias
Chief Financial Officer

Thank you for your question. As we explained during the presentation, this decline was driven primarily by the normalization of our supply chain conditions over the last year related to the Red Sea. So this has led to more normal payments during the period compared to the same period of last year. And this is, as we had explained during fiscal year 2024 results, would also explain why inventory levels have also fluctuated over the last 2 years, a slight shift in timing. This impact will normalize next year. Thank you.


James O'Shaughnessy
Senior Investor Relations Manager

We're going to move over to the webcast questions now. There's a couple of questions -- a few questions we've had today. The first of which relates to the new flagship store in Manchester. You recently opened a new flagship store in Manchester. Can you give us some color on this and your general view on the U.K., please?


Oscar Maceiras
CEO & Executive Director

Thanks for the question. Well, the U.K. is, of course, a very relevant market for us. We continue to see very good opportunities to keep on growing both for Zara and the other concepts in different locations. After recent relevant projects in cities like Liverpool or Birmingham and our recent flagship stores for Pull&Bear, Massimo Dutti, and Oysho in Oxford Street, London, we have taken advantage of our large real estate opportunity in Manchester Trafford Centre, as we mentioned during the presentation.

And this opportunity is allowing us to expand our Zara store over 40%, relocate Pull&Bear, open Bershka; and in the coming months, also to relocate our Stradivarius store. The experience of our customers has significantly improved as we are offering our different collections with a state-of-the-art technology that includes silos for online orders and returns and assisted checkout areas. For 2026, we will continue to be very active in the U.K. with plans, for instance, to refurbish some of our iconic stores in London, such as our Zara stores in Bond Street and Brompton Road. Thank you.


James O'Shaughnessy
Senior Investor Relations Manager

Thank you, Oscar. The next question on the webcast platform relates more to the younger concepts. Can you explain why some of the younger concepts have been growing quite so strongly recently, provide some color.


Oscar Maceiras
CEO & Executive Director

Thank you. Well, we are happy with the performance of our different concepts, of course, including Zara. Our other concepts are performing very well with the ambition of further diversifying our customer base and our product offering. We continue to see additional good opportunities to expand their presence in new markets.

We have just mentioned during our presentation 2 examples, the arrival of Stradivarius and Oysho to Austria and the Netherlands with the opening of our new stores in Donauzentrum, Vienna and Kalverstraat, Amsterdam. Another example is Denmark for Bershka that is about to open its first store in that market after having a very positive feedback in recent openings of the first stores in Sweden and India.


James O'Shaughnessy
Senior Investor Relations Manager

The next question relates more to the technology systems within the stores. Can you provide some more detail on the store technology ecosystem, including sorters, please?


Oscar Maceiras
CEO & Executive Director

As we have mentioned during the call, we are executing many projects to improve the customer experience in our stores, thanks to the rollout of soft-tag technology. Some of these projects involve customer-facing technology like assisted checkouts, Click & Collect and drop-off points. Customers feedback, as I have just mentioned, with the example of Manchester Trafford has been very positive with an increasing level of adoption in the different markets.

We are also introducing technology that impacts and improves the experience of our team behind the scenes in the stores. And one of these technologies, which we are rolling out in the stores are our sorters that support some processes that are key in order to make as quick as possible available to customers products that are temporarily outside the commercial floor in the stock rooms or fitting rooms or when new products arrive.


James O'Shaughnessy
Senior Investor Relations Manager

The next question on the webcast platform relates to the trading update. We had a good trading update of 9% going into the second half of the year. Can you provide some color on this, please?


Oscar Maceiras
CEO & Executive Director

Thanks for the question. Well, I guess that's obvious that we are seeing a positive evolution throughout the year. First quarter plus 4% in constant currency; second quarter, plus 6% in constant currency. And this morning, we are providing a trading update for the first 5 weeks of the third quarter, plus 9% that reflects an acceleration of the sales. We remain confident about the year ahead and, as always, focused on increasing the differentiation of the business model. The results that we have announced this morning demonstrate the strength of the model that, as we mentioned, in a complex environment keeps with high levels of profitability.


James O'Shaughnessy
Senior Investor Relations Manager

Thank you. And that concludes the webcast questions for today.


Oscar Maceiras
CEO & Executive Director
