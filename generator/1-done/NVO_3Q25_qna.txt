Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Carsten Lønborg Madsen from Danske Bank.

Carsten Madsen
Danske Bank A/S, Research Division

I think I'll start -- I have two. I'll start out with sort of a relatively basic question for Mike now that it's the first time you have your sort of a real quarterly conference call here. If we look at your roadshow presentation, you can see that in the combined obesity and diabetes market, the GLP-1 market, you lost 9 percentage points global market share over the last 12 months. That's quite a massive loss of share. We obviously knew about this trend. But still, when you look at what you can actually do in terms of strategic initiatives to turn this around, what is it the intangible initiatives that you are thinking about implementing? You tried pricing in U.S. in Q3. It doesn't really seem to have a sort of a big delta effect on your momentum in the U.S. market. So maybe if you could give some examples.

And question two is for Karsten. The acquisitions you have done or are planning to do will lead to sort of a quite significant cash outflow, especially if you get the Metsera. So if you have Akero, Metsera, you have CapEx, you also need to pay dividends next year, I assume. Is there anything you can talk about the capital planning, capital allocation and also how high in the hierarchy is the dividend payout ratio in terms of being extremely important for our investors, of course?

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

Very good. Thanks for those two questions. On the first one on market share development and perhaps market growth also will turn to you, Mike.

Maziar Doustdar
President, CEO & Member of the Management Board

Thank you very much, Carsten. So as someone who has been part of the commercial organization for so long, then I would not lie and say I don't like losing market share. But our job right now is to focus the company's strategy around diabetes and obesity predominantly because we see a huge expansion potential as we go forward. We are expanding our pipeline through our own activities as well as, of course, acquisitions. We are getting our costs under control to invest and really make sure that no stone is unturned and we're really putting most of our efforts at this point in expanding the markets. There are millions and millions of diabetes and obesity patients out there, including in the U.S. that are not getting their treatments.

Launching new products like our Wegovy pill is one way to go get there. Other ways is through increasing our commercial partnerships. You have seen Costco, Walmart, GoodRx, LifeMD, Ro, all of those are ways for us to expand the market and really make sure that through that we succeed and have a successful future. But it does take time for those measures to take effect. It's a marathon, as I have said a number of times now, not a sprint.

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, Mike. And for the second question on capital allocation, we'll turn to you, Karsten.

Karsten Knudsen
Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board

Yes. Thank you for the capital allocation question. We have a clearly articulated capital allocation framework, which is invest in the business, provided attractive return, pay out dividend in a consistent manner, do pipeline additions through BD and M&A and finally, if excess cash, do share buyback. So that's our framework, which has remained unchanged for quite a while.

And with that, I'm saying that we do have a consistent approach on dividend and have no intention of changing that. The starting point is clearly to convert our earnings into cash flow, which we focus on each and every day. And then looking at value-generating opportunities, both organically and inorganically as in the case with Akero as an example. So I hope that's clear. Back to you, Jacob.

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, Karsten. And also thanks to you, Carsten, for the two questions. With that, operator, let's turn to the next set of questions, please.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Verdult from BNP Paribas.

Peter Verdult
BNP Paribas, Research Division

Two questions, please, for Mike and Martin. Mike, don't shoot the messenger, but there are many people that view your pursuit of Metsera as an implicit signal that the -- or your confidence in the internal pipeline has waned over the past 12 months. My question is, where do you see the clinical differentiation between the assets you're looking to acquire versus a cagri, CagriSema and amycretin. Is it just the multi-dosing angle? Or are there other factors at play?

And then secondly, and this is a very simple question. But we've heard overnight from our network that Novo has been contacted by FTC for information relating to Metsera, I know you're not going to go into any details, but can you at least confirm if this is actually the case?

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, Pete. And on the first question, on Metsera, we'll turn to you first, Mike, and then Martin, you can add on the different assets.

Maziar Doustdar
President, CEO & Member of the Management Board

Thanks very much, Pete. I would say, Pete, that I am very excited about our own pipeline. I think we have a fantastic pipeline. But when you have an ambition to go to hundreds of millions of people and treat them, then no pipeline is broad enough. So we have been looking at Metsera for a long time. We are very excited about these assets. The proposal to acquire Metsera really supports our long-term strategy. And it's mainly because these assets are differentiated and complemented to our products and portfolio. That's why we are doing it.

I'll pass it on to Martin, who can more easily explain you the differentiation to our own assets, but I would say it works very complementary to what we have.

Martin Lange
EVP of R&D, Chief Scientific Officer and Member of the Management Board

I can only echo that. What we are looking for is complementary to our pipeline. You've heard us speak to many, many times, obesity is not just one disease, it's many different diseases with many different presentations. Different patients coming in with different age, different BMI, different behaviors, different needs, different body composition and different comorbidities. They have different focus areas.

And for us to really serve the full palette of patients suffering for obesity and their comorbidities, we need a diversified pipeline. What we've seen is differentiation and complementarity. And when we see that, then if we can progress that with diligence and in [indiscernible], then obviously, we're interested.

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you Mike. And thank you, Martin. And then on the second question, the FTC we'll turn to you, Karsten.

Karsten Knudsen
Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board

Yes. So the short answer is that at this point, we don't want to get into any details around the process. It's still TBD where everything lands out. We note that Metsera board assessed our to be superior, and that's what we can relate to. And then I can say as part of this due diligence, as with any other due diligence, we do comprehensive homework in terms of living up to all laws and regulations in order for the deal to close. We always do that, and we did that here also with the assistance and channels of external experts. So we are confident that this deal can close according to regulations.

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, Pete, for those two deal questions. Let's turn to the next set of questions, please.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Florent Cespedes from Bernstein.

Florent Cespedes
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

One question, a follow-up. About Medicare, maybe could you share with us your view on Medicare, on one hand, the opportunity if there is a broader coverage of people with obesity on this channel? And the second, about the potential risk or the IRA -- the next step on IRA, you gave some color on the press release about that. So any comments about this opportunity and risk on Medicare would be great.

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, Florent, for those two questions. For both of those, we'll turn to you, Dave, on Medicare potential and then on IRA.

David Moore
Executive VP of US Operations & Member of Management Board

Thanks for the question, Florent. The Medicare opportunity is very important to us and something we've been pursuing since we launched into obesity over a decade ago. And we know that there's roughly 30 million people of Medicare age that are suffering from obesity, and that is something that we feel is really important that those individuals have access to anti-obesity medicines. We can't speculate on what the potential is and how many of those patients will be able to reach, but we do see this as a very important development for us.

Regarding your second question about IRA. As Karsten mentioned, we gave an understanding of the expected impact in the company announcement as well. And it's not something that we are able to comment on. We are under strict confidentiality with CMS, and CMS will be making the announcement of what those prices are at some point in the near future.

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, Dave, and also thanks to you, Florent. And let's move to the next set of questions in line, please.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Martin Parkhoi from SEB.

Martin Parkhoi
SEB, Research Division

Two questions. I have to come a little bit back to the question that's getting from Carsten because I think he was a little bit kind to you, Mike, with respect to market share loss because if we look at the your old area IO and look at reported sales, then Lilly have actually done a sprint. They -- 2 years ago, you had a market share of 80% on all GLP-1 sales on reported numbers. And today, you are at 50%. So can you talk a little bit about what has gone, not wrong for you, but what have they done right in IO to basically capture so much more share than you? Is it commercial execution in IO across the countries? Or is just due to product superiority? Why can they sprint and you cannot?

And then second question is just on device strategy. A bit of a setback for Wegovy FlexTouch in U.S., you had argued for that to be an important part of flexibility in the consumer channel. What are you -- going to '26, are your device strategy overall also with respect to launch of products in vials and in which market would that be relevant?

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, Martin. On the first question on IO, I'll turn it over to you, Mike.

Maziar Doustdar
President, CEO & Member of the Management Board

Yes. Thanks very much. So a couple of different ways to answer your question, Martin. There are markets that we are clearly competing well and gaining market share within IO and there are markets that we are losing. So it is market dynamics that dictates IO and averages sometimes cloud the picture. In certain markets, take China as an example, the market is not growing as much as we had anticipated. We have said it in the past. It's predominantly because we have never launched a previous version of obesity drugs in that market. At the same time, we have seen in the same market that we're losing in the online battle to our competitor, predominantly because obesity drugs or Wegovy is not allowed to be sold online, while if you have a mega brand, then it's a very different picture. So that's, I would say, for China.

If you take a look at some of the European markets, take U.K. as an example. We have seen how our share of growth over a period of 1 quarter has now bypassed on initiation our competitors' numbers. So this is a dynamic market that changes. And it is really to be seen on a longer horizon and not quarter-by-quarter. We still have a patient base more than -- 2x more than our competitor in international operations. The volume strategy and the future potential of international is still incredibly attractive for us. But we came to this market with a very high level of market share, 100% on our own.

So losing market share is something that we had anticipated. And as our competitor comes and as we go also into next year, it will not just be Eli Lilly, but also in some of the markets, other players as we lose LOE. So we have to look at this longer term. And when we do look at it longer term, I am incredibly optimistic for the volumes and the level of unmet need that exists in international operations.

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, Mike. And let's move to Dave for the device question, please.

David Moore
Executive VP of US Operations & Member of Management Board

Thank you, Martin. Yes. As you mentioned, it's a setback to receive the CRL on Wegovy FlexTouch. Looking into 2026, we are looking at other presentations. This includes vials. It includes other devices that we're thinking about entering into the market, which would lead to more optionality, especially as we continue to grow in the cash channel as well.

On the FlexTouch specifically, we are in active dialogue with FDA and working through the CRL, but can't comment on any specific time lines yet at this point.

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, Dave. Thank you, Martin, for the set of two questions. And let's move to the next question, please.

Operator

Your next question comes from Sachin Jain, Bank of America.

Sachin Jain
BofA Securities, Research Division

I have two questions please, one commercial, one financial. Commercial on Wegovy pill, just wondering if you could talk about how you're scenario planning around orforglipron pricing given some news overnight and given your API restrictability, your ability to compete on price? And any further color you can give on launch cadence as we think about that launch?

And then second one for Karsten, I'm sure you're expecting the question, but the last couple of years, you've given some high-level color on year forward sort of you'd be willing to just share moving parts as we think about '26. A lot of factors there, gross to net in the base, certain IO patents, Akero, consensus sitting at roughly 7% sales, low teens EBIT, so just any high-level thoughts.

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, Sachin. The first question on oral sema, let's go to you, Dave, in terms of preparedness. Of course, for competitive reasons, we cannot go into any details, but the high-level picture, Dave.

David Moore
Executive VP of US Operations & Member of Management Board

Yes. Thanks a lot, Sachin. We're incredibly excited as we move closer to the approval date of the Wegovy pill. I think this is a big step forward in terms of expanding the market and for those individuals that align better with taking a pill for their obesity. We can't comment on specific pricing, of course. But what I would say is we are going to have the Wegovy pill available in all channels.

And this is different from previous launches because we will have the ability to focus on Medicaid, Medicare and commercial, but also have a cash offering available through all of our different telehealth partnerships as well as our own NovoCare Pharmacy and the retail partnerships that we've aligned as well. This is a new way to launch for us. And we're also thinking about the competitiveness. This is a competitive profile with respect to efficacy and tolerability, and we're really looking forward to bringing this to people living with obesity in the U.S.

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, Dave. That's very clear. And the second question, we'll turn it to you, Karsten.

Karsten Knudsen
Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board

Yes. Thank you for that question, Sachin. And I think you actually already captured some of the key elements going into your own question. So the starting point is we do not guide for next year today. We'll come back to guide for next year at a later point in time as we normally do. What I can say is, as always, current momentum is the foundation for future trends in the business. Not saying everything continues, but current momentum is where we start.

Then we have a few specific items worth calling out in relation to next year's growth rates. One is this year, we have some gross to net favorability, I would estimate it to around 2 percentage point on group sales growth this year that will not repeat into next year. So that needs to be factored into a growth rate. Then loss of exclusivity in certain IO markets. We've been calling that out for quite some time, including in our release that will have an estimated negative impact of low single digits on next year's sales growth on group sales.

Then on sales, Dave was covering the Wegovy pill, which, of course, is our main launch into next year and upon regulatory approval by the FDA. And then the final discretionary factor to call out is Akero and the step-up in R&D costs associated with that transaction pending closing expected later this year. That will have a 3% negative impact on operating profit growth in 2026.

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, Karsten, and thank you to you, Sachin, for those two questions. Now let's move to the next one in line and those set of questions, please.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Nedelcovych from TD Cowen.

Michael Nedelcovych
TD Cowen, Research Division

I have two. My first is actually a follow-up on Metsera. Martin, can you articulate what specifically about the Metsera agents is differentiated from Novo's own pipeline candidates other than the potential for once monthly dosing? In response to the previous question, you've restated that Metsera is differentiated and complementary, but I'm wondering what public data lead you to that conclusion or if those data are not public, can you confirm that? That's my first question.

And then my second question is on the evoke trials. We are now less than a month away from the CTAD presentation. So I'm assuming that Novo has the data in-house and is simply cleaning them up before top line release ahead of the presentation. So my question is, if it is an unequivocally negative result, would Novo cancel its CTAD presentation?

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you Mike, for those two questions. Now let's start with the first one on revisiting Metsera and the view on differentiation from your side, Martin.

Martin Lange
EVP of R&D, Chief Scientific Officer and Member of the Management Board

Yes. Thank you very much for the question. I don't want to go into specifics, but maybe just to iterate what we're looking at, where we look for complementarity to our pipeline. It's data on efficacy, and those can be differentiated at many levels. It's data on safety and tolerability, a little bit of the same consideration. Its scalability. And then obviously, in this case, the dose in frequency. We, on more than one parameter, see complementarity to our pipeline. And therefore, this is an effective proposition for us.

On evoke, I do want to iterate, we do not know the data in-house in this room. If we did, we would actually had to issue a corporate announcement immediately. So no knowledge amongst any of us in this room. Our starting point is to disclose data, good or bad. So we currently aim to present whatever data that we will have at CTAD in the beginning of December.

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

Thanks, Martin. That's very clear. And also thank you to you, Mike, for both of those questions. Now let's move to next question, please.

Operator

Your next question comes from Harry Sephton from UBS.

Harry Sephton
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Two on the U.S., please. So just in light of the agreed IRA direct negotiation discounts on semaglutide. And also some of the press reports yesterday on potential obesity Medicare coverage. I don't want you to comment directly, but it appears you'll end up with significantly different prices for your products across different channels. So I wanted to get your thoughts on how you expect that you're able to maintain this segmented pricing by channel? Or should we assume that all prices gradually trend towards the lowest level?

And then the second one on the U.S., just on the current U.S. market trends. Can you discuss how you're currently thinking about the levers to improve access and commercial insurance coverage on Wegovy and Ozempic going into next year? Or do you expect that the majority of the 2026 U.S. growth is really going to come from the launch of the Wegovy pill.

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, Harry. Noted two questions here. I'll send both to you, Dave. The first one on the pricing dynamics and then subsequently on the current access picture. Over to you, Dave.

David Moore
Executive VP of US Operations & Member of Management Board

Yes. Thank you much. As we mentioned, we can't discuss any of the specifics around IRA or MFN, but we do appreciate the question. And the fact that historically, we have been able to maintain different prices in different channels, given that be Medicaid, Medicare or commercial and now are increasingly expanding cash channel. Of course, we can't speculate what that will mean in the future. But historically, we have been able to maintain the differentiation between those markets and the access that comes with it.

To your second question around the trends in terms of the quality of access, it's something that continues to be really important for us as sometimes receiving an obesity medication can be a challenge because of the friction that exists in the marketplace. So we are continuing to push for and invest in improved access. It's a clear priority for us. This includes both our cash offerings. It's also what we do with payers. But we haven't seen a large uptake yet in terms of that opportunity, but it's something that we're going to continue to push for in 2026 access. We don't really expect the access to be largely changed in 2026, but we do know that each of the payers or Medicaid, as we mentioned earlier, have budget constraints and there could potentially be some loss of coverage as well.

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, Dave, for those two. And also thanks to you, Harry. Let's move to the next question, please.

Operator

Your next question comes from Emmanuel Papadakis from Deutsche Bank.

Emmanuel Papadakis
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

A few follow-ups, perhaps. Maybe taking a step back on U.S. commercial channel trends and obesity. Excuse the background noise. Wegovy scripts are pretty much flat since July despite the NASH launch. Even Zepbound has seen most of the growth coming from the cash channel. So talk us through what you think the obstacles actually are to better penetration in that commercial channel? Is it on the demand side due to product profile, lack of demand beyond the motivated minority? Or is the barrier really on the access side, for example, as you referenced potentially insurance companies making it difficult for patients to actually get on or main on therapy?

Maybe a follow-up on Metsera, the deal structure and the risk associated with that. Can you just help us understand your comfort with the risk around the way you are structuring your offer? It seems there's a reasonable chance you could end up with 50% of the company you don't control to its ultimate benefit preventing someone else from owning them. So why are you comfortable with that possibility? Or how do you expect to avoid it?

And then just a quick clarification on the Medicare access discussions. What would be upper limit discount you're contemplating be? Would that be in line with the MSP or this would be something in addition to that?

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, Emmanuel. I noted two questions there. On the first one on the Wegovy scriptions, I'll turn it to you, Dave. And on the second one afterwards, on the deal structure, I'll turn to you, Ludovic. But first, over to you, Dave.

David Moore
Executive VP of US Operations & Member of Management Board

Yes. Thank you, Emmanuel. As we mentioned earlier, the quality of access remains a focus point and certainly a challenge in the reimbursed channel. Of course, we've got that combined with intense competition. And we also mentioned that the compounding is continuing to increase as well. So that focus and investment in the quality of access, we do think is an important factor with respect to expanding the market. And in addition, you'll continue to see our efforts in expanding the cash channel through more partnerships and certainly having our product offerings available in that channel as well.

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you. And now I'll hand over to you Ludovic.

Ludovic Helfgott
Executive VP of Product & Portfolio Strategy and Member of Management Board

Thanks for the question, Emmanuel. Well, I think everything stems from, I guess, what you feel is an excitement for the portfolio of Metsera. We really believe in the assets. We believe in the team. And we believe that the deal structure that we have now, which, by the way, as Karsten said, has been vetted and discussed with external councils and experts. And believe that it's in line with all legal standards, boils down to the quality of the asset and the data that we -- and the confidence we have in the data that we have.

So of course, we know when you get into such acquisition that this deal will be reviewed, but we're comfortable that even the 50% of the shares that we would have in our pocket would be actually worth a lot if the product stands out to be the way we think it is, products with an edge, by the way, because as you said, Martin, it's a convention of product. So in all cases, as it boils down to science, we believe that we have a good value proposition. Of course, we would prefer at the end to have that in our portfolio from an operational perspective, but the value there, we believe is really, really high in all scenarios.

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, Ludovic. And now let's turn to the last two questions. For the second last question. Please go ahead, operator.

Operator

The question comes from the line of Richard Vosser from JPMorgan.

Richard Vosser
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

First question, Mike, you alluded to more telehealth involvement, particularly in the U.S. I think the prior arrangements, particularly with Hims, have faced challenges given they continue to bulk compound. So there's been some discussion around continuing or new agreements with Hims, but also the wider involvement of the telehealth. So I wondered what was different this time and whether there's any evidence of any increased pressure around from the FDA or legal pressure to remove the compounders and what could change on that front.

And then the second question, just you mentioned a couple of times about coverage, maybe even getting a little bit worse in Medicaid and maybe even the commercial payers, the barriers staying high. Well, in that case, how should we think about the pricing? Normally, we think about increased rebate levels and increased pricing should remove barriers to get more reimbursement. So how should we think about that going into '26?

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

Thanks, Richard. On the first one, I'll turn to you, Mike, on the telehealth.

Maziar Doustdar
President, CEO & Member of the Management Board

Yes. A couple of comments on that, Richard. There's been no increased pressure to answer your question directly. But what we have been quite consistent with regards to the illicit API that is coming from China and being used by compounders, we find -- since these are not FDA approved, their safety is questionable. And as a pharma company, we don't basically like that. That hasn't changed at all.

We also have been saying that we need to increase our access and we need to find ways to get to many more patients. The cash channel and eHealth is definitely an attractive way to go about it. In that context, we're having dialogue and discussions with multiple players on how we could actually increase our access and then we will see with who we should go into partnership. We've made a number of those partnerships available. So we talked about Costco. We have talked about EMed. We have talked about Walmart. And ongoing dialogues with many, many more are ongoing in pursuit of our market expansion that I spoke to earlier on.

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, Mike. That's clear. And for the second one, let's move to you again, Dave, please.

David Moore
Executive VP of US Operations & Member of Management Board

Yes. Thanks very much, Richard. We continue to have dynamics that we've discussed in the past, continued pressure, both in GLP-1 as well as in obesity with respect to price as we look to unlock more volumes. But I think it's -- I do want to reiterate that the quality of access is a clear priority for us. We are working with payers to make sure that the experience is one that patients are able to receive their medicine more seamlessly. That means lower utilization management, right? That means less of a prior authorization criteria. When we say we're investing in quality of access, that's really what we mean. And that's the focused conversation that we're having with payers.

In 2026, we don't really expect a large difference in terms of access in the commercial channel. As we mentioned, there may be some in Medicaid. But when we look at the commercial opportunity, I think it is important to note that we haven't been making progress in terms of the access. We continue to believe that the CVS opportunity remains there, and that will -- we will see Wegovy as the exclusive brand at AOM, at CVS in 2026 as well.

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

Thanks a lot, Dave. That's clear. And let's move to the final question before I hand over to you, Mike, for closing. So final question, please.

Operator

Your final question today comes from the line of James Quigley from Goldman Sachs.

James Quigley
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I've got two left, please. So firstly, on REDEFINE 4, how important is this into demonstrating differentiation from a physician and a marketing perspective versus Zepbound? Have you thought any more about how Zepbound could behave in a flexible dosing scenario versus other trials and real-world data? And can you confirm that you still look to launch CagriSema if REDEFINE 4 shows no statistically significant difference?

And second one, can you talk through the launch preparations for Wegovy in ex U.S.? I mean you've highlighted in the release and in the comments that you could look to launch in select countries versus previously when it's likely to be mainly focused in the U.S. So what's happened such that you consider also launching in the ex U.S.? And how do you balance this with U.S. launch processes and pricing, et cetera, as we head into an MFN world?

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

Thanks, James. That's two. One on the REDEFINE 4 and one on the orals sema in IO. But on the REDEFINE one, I'll turn it to you first, Martin.

Martin Lange
EVP of R&D, Chief Scientific Officer and Member of the Management Board

Yes, REDEFINE 4. As you well know, we've taken some learnings from REDEFINE 1 more specifically that we needed to do a lumber study. So we amended the REDEFINE 4 study. That being said, our base case has always been non-inferiority with an upside of superiority. In the case of non-inferiority on weight loss, we still see a potential for upside on gastrointestinal side effects and tolerability. But also we do believe that the CV benefits that we know from semaglutide could also potentially pan out and will read out from REDEFINE 3, thus clearly differentiate CagriSema vis-a-vis potential competitors. But I do want to iterate, there is still the potential for superiority upside. But obviously in an amended study, that should be taken with a little bit of a risk.

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

And let's turn to you, Ludovic, for the second one, please.

Ludovic Helfgott
Executive VP of Product & Portfolio Strategy and Member of Management Board

Absolutely. So let's take a step back. The real focus and the priority of our Wegovy pill launch is the U.S. and will remain the U.S. in 2026. As you rightly read, we are indeed opening -- we've filed, and we are opening the option to launch in selected markets in the course of 2026, depending, of course, on how things are ramping up, and we are definitely ready to -- in this market to be able to make the -- the best and the most of the Wegovy pill.

By the way, we're also very quickly transferring some knowledge from the telehealth channels, for instance, in the U.S. into some higher markets. We are very active right now as we speak in many markets across the world, not just in Europe, but also in Australia, for instance, or in other part of the world where we believe that we really are gaining progress on the telehealth side. So again, we're accelerating our overall experience curve on the telehealth and that will be -- we believe will be proven very helpful at the time we launch the Wegovy pill.

It's also not worthy to say that the IO market are also markets where we have some of the nicest experience in Rybelsus in Europe and elsewhere, which means that we can also leverage our experience in the oral markets that have been successful for Rybelsus to build even quicker position with the Wegovy pill. So priority to the U.S., but fully ready to take on some selected markets in IO when time comes.

Jacob Martin Rode
Head of Investor Relations

Thanks, Ludovic. And with that, let's conclude the Q&A session. Thank you for participating, and please feel free to ask in the Investor Relations for any follow-up questions if that's case.

Before we finally round off, I'll just turn it over to you, Mike, for some final remarks.

Maziar Doustdar
President, CEO & Member of the Management Board

Thank you, Jacob. Thank you to everyone for calling in. Before closing, I did want to make a few remarks. Although we have narrowed the full year outlook for this year and see currently competitive headwind, the unmet need is huge. The volume opportunity longer term in our core area is enormous. We are sharpening our focus on diabetes, obesity and associated comorbidities in order to address this unmet need. This is our home turf, and this is for us to drive the commercial execution and raise the innovation bar to treat many more patients and treat them better than ever before, and we will not stop until we do that. Thank you.
