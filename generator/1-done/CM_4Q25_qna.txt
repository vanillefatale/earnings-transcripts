Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Ebrahim Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

I guess Rob's prepared remarks set this up, but maybe both from Harry and Rob for both of you. When we think about -- you mentioned the 15% ROE, which I think is better than expected for this year. I guess, Harry, for you, I think the question is when you look at the franchise and hear you loud and clear, there's no big dramatic change in the strategy. But when we think about the Canadian banks, there are banks that are clearly earning much superior ROEs, 17%, 18%, and there are others who are trying to catch up to get closer to that. Given kind of your guidance for 2026 and what you see within the franchise. Just talk to us in terms of is there an opportunity for commerce to have a best-in-class ROE? Or are there structural disadvantages the bank faces to get to that point? And if so, what do you need to do differently to get there?

Harry Culham
President & CEO

Thank you, Ebrahim, I'll take it first, and I'll pass it over to Rob. It's Harry here. So as I said in my opening remarks, we are on a journey here. Our strategy and our unique competitive advantages that really position us well to deliver profitable growth. And that will lead to a premium ROE. We're targeting the right client segments where we can deepen relationships and be meaningful to our clients. We have the right product focus. We're focused on deposits, investments, transaction accounts across each of our businesses. And we believe we have the right technology. We've invested in AI-enabled technology, such as Cortex, which I mentioned at the outset, in the retail and our cash management systems in corporate and commercial. And I believe we have the right culture to take us to the next level. Our team members are focused on delivering all of our connected bank to our clients, and that will lead to this trajectory that we're forecasting moving forward to move higher from an ROE perspective. Rob, do you want to jump in with some more specifics?

Robert Sedran
Senior EVP, CFO & Enterprise Strategy

Yes. Thanks, Harry. I mean, Ebrahim, we can all -- you can all do the math, but maybe I'll try to tie it together for you in terms of some of the levers that we think we have at our disposal. But I would reiterate what Harry said, when we cross 15%, we're not going to be hanging mission accomplished banners at CIBC Square. Like we do think the strategy will continue to push the ROE higher over time. And just because we're not changing our target at this time, it doesn't mean that our ambition isn't for a higher ROE. And we don't see any disadvantages that can't allow us to continue to push that ROE higher. When you think of some of the things that are going to get us there, you start off just even normalizing credit losses. I mean the performing provisions that we took this quarter around $450 million, that alone is about 60 basis points. We don't plan for that to happen every year as that normalizes, and that's even before considering the potential for impaired losses to come down. That's an ROE tailwind that we expect. Operating leverage is just -- is an operating philosophy for us. You think about a couple of hundred points of operating leverage, which is not necessarily fiscal '26 guidance, but it is a target that we shoot for sort of through the cycle. A couple of hundred points of operating leverage is another, call it, 30 or 40 basis points of ROE expansion that we can -- we expect to see. When you think about our capital position, we optimize the balance sheet as best we can, call it, a basis point is basically a basis point. So if the capital CET1 comes down by 40 or 50 basis points, the ROE goes up by 40 or 50 basis points, excess capital doesn't expire. We're not in a rush to get rid of it. But we do have a buyback active and we do see opportunities to deploy profitably over time. So there's a number of levers that are adding up to our confidence that the ROE trajectory is going to continue beyond next year.

Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Lee from Canaccord Genuity.

Matthew Lee
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

NIM continues to be a big story for you. I know you've talked about persistent NIM increases and provide some color directionally, but can you maybe break down the NIM improvements based on product mix, deposit mix and tractors. Just trying to get a better understanding of which of those factors are having the biggest impact? And then what levels of sustainability there is beyond 2026?

Robert Sedran
Senior EVP, CFO & Enterprise Strategy

Matthew, it's Rob. I'm going to get started and then hand it to Hratch because I think a lot of the story from a business mix perspective is unfolding in Personal and Business Banking. The tractoring strategy has been a persistent tailwind for us. We think that tailwind is going to continue through '26, albeit perhaps starting to moderate a little bit. But the tractoring is something that is largely based on the forward curve, and provided the rates hang around where they have been. We expect to see that benefit persist in both Personal and Business Banking and at the all bank level. When it comes to business mix, it's probably better to hand it off because it is very much on strategy, and I'll let Hratch talk a little bit about what he's seeing.

Hratch Panossian
Senior EVP and Group Head of Canadian Personal & Business Banking

Yes. Thanks, Rob. Matthew, thanks for the question. I'll start by saying, look, we're very proud of what the team has been able to accomplish on the retail side, right? What you're seeing, as Rob said, is really the result of strong execution, pricing discipline and strategy. Yes, rates in the environment are helping, but that's actually been a smaller part of the story as we look through this year. So I think we've talked about this before. When you look at the rate help in the business, it's a few basis points a quarter. And when you look at the full year this year, full year ROE is about 30 basis points higher on a year-over-year basis, and a lot of that has been driven by the strategy. And we've been very clear about our strategy. We're focused on our clients. We're focused on being that everyday bank for our clients and have them highly engaged. That means focusing on the everyday products and winning share there. And I think we've done that well this year. You look at our demand deposits that actually grew double digits before we did some work to optimize margins. We actually ran off some high interest deposits deliberately that were negative margin. So without that, demand deposits that were profitable are up double digits for the year. We've increased our cards business 6%. That helps. We've been very deliberate on the mortgage business. We've been doing business with the clients that are franchised with us. We price sharply, but we price for the overall relationship. We will not price mortgages individually. And by doing that, we've been expanding margins in the mortgage business as well. And so if you look at this quarter's 11 basis points, it's a lot of the same drivers, right? It's those products that are growing that are higher margin, it's the margins in mortgages going up, it's the margins and deposits going up. And I think that's what has allowed us as a team to deliver from what I can see right now this quarter's street-leading revenue growth. And I think there is a lot more momentum to go as we continue to execute on our strategy. The interest rate, right, will slow down. I think the interest rate help through '27 will slow down, but we can continue to execute on our strategy and accreting to margin and accreting to ROE in this business.

Our next question comes from John Aiken from Jefferies.

John Aiken
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Rob, we just drilled down NIM. I'd like to take a little -- closer look on expenses if we can. Obviously, you're looking for positive operating leverage next year. But as we look at the investments that you're making in terms of your platforms, technology, everything else like that, are there any of the segments that you would expect to have greater or lesser operating leverage as you look out to 2026?

Robert Sedran
Senior EVP, CFO & Enterprise Strategy

John, it's Rob. So good question. And we tend not to focus too much on operating leverage at the individual segment level in any given year. There is some differences between them, some investments that we're making and some strategic initiatives that can pop up. You saw a little bit of that in Q4, right? So if you look at some of the Q4 expenses, we had pretty good visibility coming into the quarter on revenue growth, pretty good visibility on operating leverage, and decided to take the opportunity to advance some of the -- those strategic initiatives that we often talk about. As we think about the coming year, all -- we ask for positive operating leverage from all of the businesses. But a year like what Capital Markets had as an example, this year, it's going to make it a little bit harder for Capital Markets to deliver positive operating leverage next year. We don't let them completely off the hook, but it's just something that we don't necessarily assume is going to happen. The other businesses, we're targeting positive operating leverage. But again, we're going to manage it through the year and really aiming to deliver it at the all bank level rather than the individual segment level.

John Aiken
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

And just as a follow-on, when we look at technology spend in particular, are we looking at this in totality accelerating, leveling off or staying reasonably the same?

Robert Sedran
Senior EVP, CFO & Enterprise Strategy

No, I think we need to assume that technology spend continues to grow, right? There's a lot of talk about AI, a lot of talk about the different operating models. But AI isn't pixie dust. It requires investment. We're making those investments. And we are going to continue to add resources there and reshape the workforce as well over time. We think we've been managing through it so far, and we're going to continue to accelerate those investments. We spent time putting governance structures around our technology spend, putting in a really deep dive on how we allocate those technology spends. We think we've been smart and purposeful on those investments. That's going to continue, but particularly with a robust revenue environment that we've had, we would expect to continue to invest in technology. It's the way forward for the industry. It's certainly the way forward for our bank.

Our next question comes from Doug Young from Desjardins Capital Markets.

Doug Young
Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division

Just a few things on capital, Rob. First, you said there's a 20 basis point benefit you're getting in Q2 of '26. What's driving that? And is there anything else coming down the pipe to think about? And then like the focus for excess capital, I assume it's buybacks and tuck-ins. And then like thinking about capital and you're looking at a 15% plus ROE. Like what CET1 are you triangulating to for fiscal '26?

Robert Sedran
Senior EVP, CFO & Enterprise Strategy

Okay. Thanks, Doug. It's Rob. So it was 25 basis points. And you will recall in Q1 of '23, we had an operational risk charge that showed up in our results in Q2 of -- showed up in operational risk weights, excuse me, in Q2 of '23. The rules allow for the potential exclusion of that 3 years forward, and we did receive approval to remove that from our operational risk weights. So 3 years later, it will be Q2 of '26. So we'll be adding the 25 basis points of CET1 back at that time. When we think about the level of capital at which we're looking to operate, obviously, it's -- we're running with significant excess common equity. We would say that we aim for about 100 basis points above the regulatory minimum. That would be around 12.5%. A second gate though, on that is the competitive dynamic and where our competitors are. What is assumed in our capital plans for the coming year, is basically the ongoing buyback that we have, ongoing robust capital deployment, which we expect to see risk-weighted asset growth. So we're not seeing a huge drawdown in our capital ratio, but we do expect the capital ratio to move a little bit lower in line with the buyback. And from a deployment perspective, the story really hasn't changed. We think we've got four growth businesses that over time can absorb that excess common equity, profitable growth across all of our businesses. We are always looking around for tuck-in acquisitions that could advance and accelerate our strategy. I wouldn't say much more beyond that from an acquisition perspective at this point. It is largely of a tuck-in variety. And so it's more of the same from what you've heard from us in the past.

Our next question comes from Mario Mendonca from TD Securities.

Mario Mendonca
TD Cowen, Research Division

I think Rob and Harry, when you were referring to the potential ROE improvement, one segment that was left out was the U.S. And what I'm observing there for the quarter and for a few years now is that expense growth has been very elevated. And I appreciate it's things like comp and tech spending and -- but it seems like there's a major project going on in the U.S., perhaps it's compliance-related spending. Can you talk about what's going on there and when you expect that spending to become a little more in line with the revenue growth, so that business can contribute as well?

Robert Sedran
Senior EVP, CFO & Enterprise Strategy

Maybe I'll start -- it's Rob. Maybe I'll start, and I'll pass it off to Kevin to give a little bit of color. We have said and we've been saying for a while, I guess, on the U.S. side that we are building for the bank we want to be, not necessarily the bank we are. And regardless of the direction of travel on regulatory requirements in the short term, it does require us to invest in that infrastructure to support the growth profile that we expect to see coming in the coming quarters and years. So we've been going through an awful lot of that. I do think -- we do think the path from here is not quite at the same level of growth. There was some strategic spend in Q4 as well that makes it look a little bit on the high side, and maybe that's a good place to hand it off to Kevin to talk a little bit about what happened in Q4 and a little bit about how we seize the outlook.

Kevin Lee

Right. Thanks, Rob, and Mario, thanks for the question. Very happy to be here today. So the elevated expenses in the quarter were due to a number of factors. Number one, performance-based compensation was a large part of it. But -- and Rob referenced this a little bit, there was a charge of about USD 10 million relating to the optimization of our branch network. Also important to note that there is going to be a corresponding annual savings to that is almost at the same level. And in addition to that, there were really a number of just other smaller seasonal items. So important to take away that we expect expense growth to normalize and be in the mid-single digits next year exactly in line with the broader bank.

Mario Mendonca
TD Cowen, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. Let's drill down something else. The capital markets business, the loan growth there has been exceptional. By my math, 22% year-over-year this quarter. Last couple of quarters have been running very hot. Can you speak to what's growing there and address the notion that sometimes growth in this area just leads to grief 2, 3 years later. We've seen this at banks in the past. So talk about what's going on there and maybe address the concern that this is going to be an issue 2 or 3 years from now.

Christian Exshaw

Thanks for the question, Mario. This is Christian. So I'll just take it back to the U.S. strategy. So as Rob mentioned, the U.S. has been growing quite considerably for us. The U.S. now is roughly 34%, 35% of the Capital Markets revenue. It's roughly double what it was actually 5 years ago, and we continue to, I would say, invest in this business. When you look at, I would say, the corporate credit book, it actually generates now more revenue in the U.S. than it does in Canada. And that just means that we've been onboarding many, many more, I would say, clients, so just in line with our strategy. And remind you that when it comes, I would say, to looking at this loan book, it really is about having an anchor product, so we can actually cross-sell, whether it's advisory services or hedging product. The other area, which has been growing considerably, as you noted, has been the business that we call global credit financing business. We created this business a number of years ago. And for risk purposes, we put all these businesses together. So it encompasses businesses such as repos, ABS, MBS, securitization, CLOs and loan warehousing. And we actually like this business very much, I would say, because it scores strongly on three metrics. Number one, as I said, is that it is client-driven and therefore, aligned with our strategy. And we -- in that business, you deal mainly with the highest quality sponsors, pension plans, asset managers, insurers and some wealth firms. And we deepen the share of wallet with those clients with, call it, 8 to 10 different products, as I said, from advisory to hedging products. Number two, returns strong balance sheet returns. We, on average, make comfortably over 20% ROE in these businesses. And then number three, which, as you pointed out, we actually like the risk in these businesses. Transactions are written in most of the business to a single A or AA equivalent. In securitization, it's more AA to AAA. So we like this. Well, in the loan warehousing facilities or CLO businesses we're always second loss, so obviously, it protects the bank. Now what's also very important is the quality of the people looking after these businesses. Most of the senior leaders have over 20 years of experience, and they either have a credit risk management background. So they actually originally had this in their experience, in their CV. And number two, if not, they are, I would say, highly experienced traders.

Mario Mendonca
TD Cowen, Research Division

So would I be correct in suggesting that the growth is being driven by the nondeposit-taking financial institutions business, the stuff that has become very topical recently?

Christian Exshaw

Yes, that's correct.

Our next question comes from the line of Sohrab Movahedi from BMO Capital Markets.

Sohrab Movahedi
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Rob, just looking at your Slide 13, you've given us the capital waterfall here. We've just talked a little bit about the good loan growth that comes across all the businesses. And as you think about next year, as you think about that ROE kind of build, could we see a situation where your RWA growth is exceeding your internal capital generation? .

Robert Sedran
Senior EVP, CFO & Enterprise Strategy

Sohrab, it's Rob. Thanks. It's a good question, and it's not certainly how we expect it to roll forward. We continue to see quarterly capital generation -- organic capital generation, something in the area of 10 basis points a quarter. If we think earnings net of dividends ballpark it at around 35, more typical of risk-weighted asset growth before credit migration would be around 25. That's kind of how you get to the 10 basis points a quarter. This quarter, we saw a little bit elevated credit migration related to the housing market being a little bit sluggish. We don't expect any losses on that, but we did have to set some capital aside, but we still anticipate a positive internal capital generation.

Our next question comes from Gabriel Dechaine from National Bank.

Gabriel Dechaine
National Bank Financial, Inc., Research Division

First for Frank. Your outlook for impaired provisions lower than losses than we saw this year. I get that. Just wondering what the influence of USMCA difficulties would be, how that would affect that outlook? And then about the capital deployment strategy. No mention of M&A. And I'm just bringing this up to kind of check a box on the list, but just to feel the pulse given the new leadership. What's your appetite for M&A? It can spice things up but can also lead to heartburn.

Frank Guse
Senior EVP & Chief Risk Officer

Thanks For the question. So as I said, entering fiscal 2026, we expect impaired provisions to remain broadly stable in comparison to 2025. And then our base case would say that economic environment should strengthen throughout the year and in particular, the back half of the year, which is why we believe it should actually end up at the slightly lower end of our previous guidance, and that's why we call it mid- to low 30s on a go-forward basis. What we are, of course, looking closely at is although the trade negotiations, but even more so, what happens to interest rates, higher unemployment, and some of the other uncertainties that we are facing. And I think what came through in my prepared remarks is we remain very confident in the strength of our position, where we are from a credit perspective, sorry. And continue to monitor that portfolio performance quite well. It's hard to say where we would end in different scenarios. But what I can say, we have given a little bit of a broader range to reflect a variety of scenarios that we clearly looked at.

Gabriel Dechaine
National Bank Financial, Inc., Research Division

Probably not -- you wouldn't get the back half improvement if the negotiations break down perhaps?

Frank Guse
Senior EVP & Chief Risk Officer

I think that's a fair assumption, yes.

Harry Culham
President & CEO

And Gabriel, it's Harry here. Thank you for that question. And just around our deployment priorities when it comes to capital, just to reiterate what Rob said and maybe elaborate a little bit. We continue to have that four-pronged approach to capital deployment. And we have the ability to activate all four levers when needed. We're really focused on growing organically, supporting our clients, and we think we have ample opportunity to deploy our capital over time in this respect as we deepen our relationships across our platform. Dividend and dividend growth, and we do that once a year, as you know, in line with our earnings expectations. And you heard Rob speak about that earlier. Our buybacks, which we've been doing and we'll continue to be active in. And this is a method to manage our share count, manage our capital position, but it -- and we have the flexibility to pick up the pace to slow it down if the operating environment changes. And of course, as you alluded to M&A, which would -- as Rob said, would be in capital-light businesses, really opportunistic tuck-ins that are strategically and very importantly, culturally complementary to our existing platform and accretive to ROE over time. So all four levers of this strategy really are tied to our goal of delivering a premium ROE over the medium term. And hopefully, you're hearing that we're running our bank and our strategy in a stable steady, predictable and consistent manner. And that's how we like to run our capital deployment as well.

Operator

And our last question comes from Darko Mihelic from RBC Capital Markets.

Darko Mihelic
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Just wanted to follow on the question that Mario asked. Christian, you gave a lot of detail, and thank you very much for Slide 44 on essentially private credit sort of exposures. It does elicit a couple of questions for me, though, just to help build the mosaic around these exposures. The first question, Christian, is it's been great growth. It's been very low losses. I suspect you probably would tell me that a stress test loss will also be relatively low. So what is your risk appetite here? You did say it's client-driven. So if this continues to be an area that's hot, how far are you willing to push the envelope and make this a bigger part of your total balance sheet?

Harry Culham
President & CEO

It's Harry, Darko. I'm just going to jump in quickly because I think this -- the support of our clients in this segment, the nonbank financial institutions, touches all of our SBUs, but I'll pass it over to Christian to answer your question in a second. The first thing I'd say is, this business reference is really core to our client-focused strategy. We are delivering robust risk-adjusted returns, and it's really aligned to our client activity as clients move from public to private markets, which we're all seeing. This is a broad-based portfolio. And as Christian pointed out, it's highly diversified across geographies, business segments and products and clients. And the underlying loans and structures have a meaningful risk mitigants that we are very comfortable with. We have grown at a very rapid pace over the last while. We came from a very small franchise over years to deepen these relationships with the most prominent players in the space. But Christian, why don't you just take it from there, please?

Christian Exshaw

I think, Harry, you're right. Thank you for the question. As Harry stated, that number I would say, encompasses the entire space of what it is we do at CIBC. You are not going to see, I would say, so much growth going forward. As Harry said, we have been playing a catch-up. We are building a number of businesses in the U.S., power trading. We've applied for primary dealership. We're building a futures trading capability. So we need, I would say, to diversify the resources. We don't want from a risk perspective to concentrate all of our funding, all of our capital in one area. So we're pretty happy where it is. And we should see, I would say the, I would say, low to -- sorry, high single-digit growth in this year.

Operator

I will now turn the call back over to Harry for closing remarks.

Harry Culham
President & CEO

Great. Thank you, operator, and thank you all for your engagement this morning. I do recognize it's a very busy morning. But I do want to close today's call by thanking our incredible CIBC team. Having engaged with thousands of team members during our leadership transition, the pride and the confidence of our team as in our bank is very clear. Thank you for bringing our purpose to life and for everything you do for our clients, our team and our communities and, of course, our shareholders.

So as we enter the giving season, I want to recognize our team's tremendous commitment to our communities as our team generously gives their time and dollars to make a meaningful difference. From the CIBC Run for the Cure in October to CIBC Miracle Day just yesterday, I'm very proud of our culture of care and the difference our team makes in our communities. And on that note, I also wanted to acknowledge Sandy Sharman, our current Group Head of People, Culture and Brand, who will be retiring from CIBC at the end of 2026. Through Sandy's 19 years at the bank, her contributions have been instrumental in reinvigorating our brand and building out the client focused connected and caring culture that differentiates us today.

And I would also like to welcome Richard Jardim and Yvonne Dimitroff to the executive leadership team at CIBC. Richard will assume the role of SVP, Chief Technology and Information Officer; and Yvonne will assume the role of EVP, Chief Human Resources Officer. Finally, in closing, wishing you and your families a safe and happy holiday season, and I look forward to catching up in the new year. Thank you very much.
