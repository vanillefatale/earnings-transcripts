[Interpreted] The core objective of the new policies is to promote the healthy development of the long-form video industry. In the past 2 months, since its implementation, we have observed positive programs in several areas, including the concurrent review of key dramas by the national and provisional administration as well as the exploration of concurrent review of broadcasting for new content formats such as anthology drama, multi-season drama, multi-art drama and pickup as well as the optimization of co-review.

Under the new policy environment, we are actively innovating in content production and broadcasting models. For example, we are exploring a brand-new content format called online feature series and integrating it into our existing emerging film project collaboration framework. Going through a revenue-sharing model with our partners, we aim to attract more creative talent and high-quality content, strongly driving innovation and also growth in the industry.

Based on the current progress of implementation, it is clear that the new policies have sent positive signals to the industry. Some of our projects have already benefited by the policy support, allowing them to reach a ready-to-broadcast status more quickly. As productions proceed smoothly in the future, we will gradually see the broad benefits of the policies take shape. In the long term, the policies will drive the industry into a more -- a new growth phase, benefiting professionals across board.

Xianghua Yang
Senior VP and President of Membership & Overseas Business Group

[Interpreted] Our overseas business has strong performance this year with Q3 total revenue and membership revenue, achieving the highest annual sequential growth in the past 2 years. We see the Chinese content serves as the cornerstone of our overseas content portfolio, and iQIYI has become the top choice for an increasing number of overseas users to watch Chinese language content. We continue to promote Chinese language content across various markets and have seen a significant increase in influence in major overseas markets, which effectively driving the growth in user base and also the membership numbers.

In terms of local content, we have engaged in both licensing and original production in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Taiwan. Among these, Thailand has been our most successful market. This year, we launched several hit titles such as the Thai drama, Khemjira, The Series, which set new records on our overseas platform in terms of both viewing hours and revenue for Thai content. With subtitles added, our original Thai dramas have been distributed in other markets and the revenue from our original Thai dramas in the U.S. and other overseas markets has already surpassed that of Thailand's domestic market.

We are pleased to see that Thai dramas have become the second globally recognized content category after C-dramas. And looking ahead, we plan to increase the production of original Thai, Malaysian and Indonesian dramas.

At the beginning of the year, we mentioned that some of the newly developed markets, such as the Middle East, Spanish-speaking regions in Latin America and Brazil regions. And these regions have maintained rapid growth actually throughout the year, with significant increases in membership revenue and subscriber numbers. In the future, we will continue to deliver high-quality content while leveraging AI technology to enhance content production and promotional efficiency. And currently, over 70% of promotional materials for our overseas content are generated using AI, which is significantly boosting our market efficiency.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from [ Zei Zei Zhao from Guangfa Securities ].

Unknown Analyst

[Foreign Language] The application of AI in the global film and television industry has been advancing, increasing depth. Could management share strategic insights and future plans pertaining to AI adoption, content production and business layout?

Chang Yu
IR Director

Thank you. We'll have our CEO, Mr. Yu Gong, to take this question.

Tim Yu
Founder, CEO & Director

[Interpreted] Okay. For -- I think for the AI technology, it provides a very opportunities outlook for iQIYI. To take analogy, for example, in the past 20 years, actually, the Internet actually provided on the video industry an opportunity and advantage to surpass traditional linear TV. And we think currently with the large language models for AI actually provides a similar opportunity outlook for iQIYI.

In the past few years, actually, the AI technology has deeply integrated in our operations and then helping us to achieve goals in 3 key areas. The first one is to increase our operational efficiency. We use AI for marketing materials, for example, automatically to generate posters and also promoting promotional marketing materials. And also we use that for overseas content translation, while the cost is much cheaper compared to the human labor side and also faster.

The second point is AI actually boosts monetization capabilities, as it can efficiently produce advertising creative materials, and we can use that to optimize placement algorithms, which help us to improve the targeting accuracy and also conversion rate.

The third point is AI can power us to -- for content production. Actually, we use AI as the core for our internal production capabilities. For example, we have a stream play workshop in iQIYI. We use that to significantly enhance the evaluation and also the creation capabilities for novels and scripts. And also, we have an image workshop feature, which can effectively support early-stage creative development for example, by providing concept posters and also storyboard generations and character design.

And the fourth point is we actually use AI to roll out some basic user features, for example, based on the AI, we rolled out the Taodo World, Taodo and also iJump features. All of these will improve the viewing experiences.

The above mentioned 4 points earlier are the ones we already use in our dry operation. We'll keep of refining them and upgrading them. Hopefully, it will bring more benefits. And now and going forward, we'll focus on 3 major areas. The first one is the iQIYI's intelligent production system, which actually was previously reserved for internal use, and we will, going forward, gradually open up its core functions for close partners, so helping them to leverage AI to enhance their production capabilities.

And third point is we will continue to promote on the -- promoting using AI in the market and also for the industry. For example, we launched initiatives such as the AI short film creation competition, as I mentioned earlier in the opening remarks, and also turning up with Academy winners, Peter Pau, to roll out the AI Theater. I think the main purpose for these initiatives are to discover and nurture AIGC-creative talent through collaborations and also market promotions. The purpose is to foster an innovative-driven content ecosystem going forward.

And last but not least, our focus will be collaborating with our partners and also utilizing our current AI technologies to explore more on a large-scale application of AIGC in areas, for example, like micro animation, animations, educational content documentary, et cetera. And hopefully, iQIYI will become core engine of content creation. And this is the first stage. And going forward, the bigger picture will be utilize AIGC to apply them in our long-form vehicle content, for example, dramas, for example, films.

So we're estimating in probably in the next 1 to 2 years. That's on the slower side or maybe 3 years. But we think overall speaking, no more than 5 years, AI will bring a dramatic change to our internet space and also to the video content creation industry. So going forward and also currently, we have been investing heavily in AIGC and also AI technology applications and this is one of the amount of core area of investment for the company right now. So hopefully, going forward, we can utilize AI to do more creative content and also to change the content ecosystem.
