[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum.

Christian Schwab
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

What wasn't clear to me exactly is on the booking strength -- potential booking strength of $60 million to $80 million in the second half of this fiscal year. Is that almost entirely on the AI accelerator processor line?

Gayn Erickson
President, CEO & Director

There's some silicon carbide, not much, like not very much at all. There is some silicon photonics for sure. But the bulk of it is across wafer-level and packaged-part burn-in for AI processors, yes.

Christian Schwab
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

Okay. Perfect. And then given that such a material bookings from the AI processor market, can you give us any indication or idea? I know we've talked about the opportunity in that marketplace being bigger than silicon carbide. But let's narrow it down to kind of a multiyear time frame kind of including '27 and '28. Do you see that business after initial orders expanding meaningfully from there?

Gayn Erickson
President, CEO & Director

We do. We do. And we've been taking a pretty conservative stance on how large, particularly the AI and the wafer level side of it is. And I want -- conservative may not be fair. Candidly, we're still trying to get our arms around how big it is. What we get is visibility of a specific GPU or CPU or network processor or an ASIC. And then we hear these things from the customer and then we look externally and what are they telling the Street and try and correlate to those lookups.

And I'd say pretty consistently, we hear bigger numbers from the customer than the Street. I'm not sure what that all means, okay? And then as they give us test time estimates of what the burn-in conditions are, we can start to put some numbers around it. But a single processor for some of these big guys at wafer-level burn-in is 20, 30 systems or so.

And these are $4 million, $5 million machines. So you get a feel for the size of what that looks like. And the estimates of -- today, if you were to look at AI spend in test between test and burn-in, is it $8 billion, $10 billion to maybe $15 billion or so. I mean it's a really large number. So we don't want to get ahead of ourselves here. But when customers ask you things like how many can you make, right?

So can the AI business be measured in hundreds of millions of dollars for Aehr Test a few years out? Yes. for sure. Now what's interesting is that we're in this -- I think it's an awesome position to be in because our -- the Sonoma system is a highly preferred system for HTOL, the high-temp operating life reliability testing for these AI processors. It has the largest installed base in all the test houses around the world. We're getting people that approach us because we are the -- we are like -- I don't want to say we're the de facto standard, that's probably bold, but we have more capacity than everybody else.

And therefore, they are saying, you're kind of the go-to guy. I like those words. And so -- and we can build lots of them. So customers are using that, and we get a front row seat to actually bring them up. Then we say, "Oh, by the way, if you want, you can take this machine, add production handling to it and do production on it." In the meantime, if you come to our facility and you do a tour and you can see that production test cell for the Sonoma automation, we, of course, will walk you by a FOX wafer-level burn-in test cell and mention, "Oh, by the way, that happens to be doing a benchmark on a 300-millimeter wafer, we can't tell you who it is."

And so they're like, well, what is that? So we are in a position to be able to talk about both of them. And the ASPs are actually higher on the wafer-level side of things. And -- but the value proposition way outweighs that because of the yield advantage of doing at wafer level. The yield savings [ dwarfs any of the ] costs or the cost to test the wafer-level burn-in. So as we get our arms around the market, the market data that would be out there would be packaged part because no one is doing wafer level except for us.

And so we're creating our own models related to, okay, for that unit capacity, if you went to wafer-level burn-in, what would that look like? Kind of similar to what we had to go through in the original silicon carbide side of things of -- if the whole market -- and we're not seeing -- everybody including NVIDIA and Google and Microsoft and Tesla and these guys all went with us how big is that market? We haven't really tried to put our arms around that yet, but it's substantial.

Christian Schwab
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

Great. And then I guess one last question, if I may, and follow up on your comment about capacity. How many systems do you think you're capable of manufacturing in a year for wafer level?

Gayn Erickson
President, CEO & Director

We have talked to customers about capacities exceeding 20 systems a month at either package or wafer level. If we had to, we could ship 20 systems a month of each during this calendar year. Now that's bigger than our forecast by a lot. But you know what, when people are saying, could you do something like this and intercept something, it's like if they gave you an order for 50 or 100 Sonomas, like how long is it going to take you to build them? Makes sense?

Christian Schwab
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

Makes perfect sense. No other questions.

The next question comes from Jed Dorsheimer with William Blair.

Jonathan Dorsheimer
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Yes, I guess maybe just to start, on the wafer level, I think your prior comments around the timing of the benchmark, it seems like that's taken a little bit longer. And I'm just wondering, is that a function of -- is it because it's new and what you're seeing is from the customer is that they're changing parameters that's extending that out? Because I think you had maybe talked about by February time frame, and we were almost...

Gayn Erickson
President, CEO & Director

Do you want me to throw my customer under the bus? Is that what you're trying to tell me, but...

Jonathan Dorsheimer
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

No, no, no...

Gayn Erickson
President, CEO & Director

Let me answer that. No, I got it. I got it. No, that's totally fair, okay? What I do in all of these things is try to describe exactly what we feel, what we know, what we knew at the time. This -- one of the things that's very interesting and fun about this particular customer who is a very notable customer, okay? When they gave us, and I don't think I'm [ overstating, ] when they gave us the vectors, the test vectors, et cetera, they were giving it off of a platform from package level, okay?

Package and wafer are different. We had a huge arm wrestle with them related to what they could actually do at wafer level and ultimately, we're able to demonstrate to them significant DFT, lower pin count modes, et cetera, to be able to do it at wafer level, which was a big deal because they never understood that because, of course, nobody has ever done this before with us, okay?

I'll just leave it at this. They actually gave us some things that were implied based upon package that didn't really weren't totally applicable to wafer level, and we struggled with some of that. And it turns out -- so it actually did delay a little bit. I think they -- it's mutually understood. It's like, "Oh, sorry, that we were thinking in package, we forget about wafer and sort." And that's a growing thing. We've seen this with other customers. On the very first time you're doing wafer level burn-in, you just don't think about it from the challenges or the differences at what happens when you're talking about a device that shares common substrates or from a probing environment.

So is it longer? Maybe a little bit, measured in weeks or a couple of months or something. But some of the things that like mechanically wafer physical contact to the device using our auto aligner to pack these new fine-pitch WaferPaks, the test plan itself, the vectors, those things were all going along pretty well. So I wish it was a little bit sooner, but I think we're still very much on track to try and get them some data over the next couple of months here or even maybe even this month.

So now the question, of course, parlays into what do they do with it? What's the timing? Do you understand what device they want to cut in? We do. We're not going to share that with you guys. are we going to make it? We believe we're still -- there's lots of reasons to actually want to cut in wafer-level burn-in and the sooner, the better. So I'm actually -- we're really excited about this particular one. And then now we've got another couple of guys that are saying, "Pick me, pick me too" and are generating the information to give us so that we can actually do design reviews and walk through a WaferPak design for them as well.

Jonathan Dorsheimer
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And I just want to address the potential of cannibalization between package and wafer level. And if I read through your comments, it seems like the AI processor is what's moving along with this customer on the wafer level. You had mentioned briefly actually on the ASIC side. Do you -- are you anticipating that the ASICs basically run with package level and that AI processors are wafer level? Or are you anticipating both at wafer level?

Gayn Erickson
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Okay. Okay. So vocabulary for everybody that's’ listening out there, right? So there -- when you talk about processors in the AI, arguably, there's even maybe at least 2 or 3 different broad flavors of them, okay? You're going to have the actual GPU, if it's an NVIDIA or ASIC when you talk about everybody else's. In reality, the GPU is kind of an ASIC at NVIDIA too. Jensen said that at one point. These are AI accelerator platforms, okay?

And then there -- and they can be used for large language models or for inference type things. There's also processors that like CPUs, like Intel or Grace or Vera-type CPUs and others that are making them that are also going through a burn-in process. And then there's -- you could argue there's even network processors and things like that. But generally, when we talk about AI processors, we're generally in the CPU and GPU type or ASIC type that are combined together in these AI processor clusters.

And things like you hear at GB200 is Grace CPU and 2 Blackwell AI accelerators in 1 package, if you will, or in 1 cluster. What's happening with the road map is that devices are going from a single AI accelerator or CPU on a -- in a package to a package that includes embedded memory, like high-bandwidth memory and high-bandwidth flash over time and then to having more than 1 compute chip in it. So having 2 processors in it or 4 or 8, like you look at the Intel or the AMD road map. Everyone has a road map to 2 or 4 more AI processors on a single substrate. What's happening is that there is a -- the qualification of those are all done today in a full package. The whole device in a big substrate is done, and it can take months to even go to get the packaging and qual that. So there are people that would like to be able to qual the processor inside when it's still in wafer form, right?

From a production perspective, the value proposition is you're burning in these devices and when they fail, you take out the other compute chip and all the memory plus the co-os substrate, which costs more than the silicon of the compute chip itself. So the road map is getting more intense. So there's people that are like, oh, I want to evaluate this for this device, this would make sense. But boy, the next one makes twice as much sense and the one next to that is 4x as much sense because of this evolution.

So a lot of trends we discussed, okay, is there a window. Like what happens if you just missed this one device, it doesn't feel like that it's a treadmill of you can always step on. And the customers are like, okay, how do I cut you in? I've said publicly that our large package part production customer, we've talked about it as an ASIC hyperscaler. They're actually on Sonoma production. We're qualifying their next device that's going to go to production, we believe and hope it will go on Sonoma as well. okay?

The third one that are giving us design files of so we can make sure that Sonoma is ready for that, but they've also said, you know what, by then maybe we want to consider FOX wafer-level burn-in. And an interesting thing is it's like, well, what will you do with all the package systems from us, who cares? It's like, what? Because if I could move it to wafer level, I don't need to do it a package anymore. Now will it cut over just like that, we'll see. I think the world is going to be both for a long time, and we're in a great position to do both.

But is there cannibalization? For sure. We had a customer come in who wanted to talk about what we thought was packaged part burn-in. Alberto, our VP over the packaged part business, and I met with them and 15 minutes into the meeting, he goes, I'd like to talk about wafer level. Alberto looked over at me and I'm like, okay, new slides. So at least we got both. And we're in a great position. And actually, I would say it's all 3, we do the high-temp operating life today only at package over time at wafer level, and we do production burn-in either package or wafer level. So a great front row seat.

Our next question comes from Max Michaelis with Lake Street Capital.

Maxwell Michaelis
Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division

First one for me, just around the bookings guide. I know you previously shared that majority of around AI. But just given the distinction between the low end and the high end, if we just take the midpoint of around $70 million, I mean, what -- to get to that $80 million, is that all basically around AI? Or does that suggest any improvement around silicon carbide or GaN?

Gayn Erickson
President, CEO & Director

It's the least in that number is silicon carbide, okay? And then GaN is pretty close. Hard disk drive is a little bigger. Then silicon photonics is a chunk. I mean we've got production systems in there for our production -- our lead customer. We have a new customer that wants a system. They want a chip by May. We're suggesting to them that they really should get their order in before we ship it, joke, joke. I'm kidding, it's a challenge right now because they're like, please, please build it. we actually have a system on our floor. And if they get their PO in if you're listening, you get to get it, if not, we'll give it to the next guy, but anyhow. And then it would be wafer-level burn-in. And then I think package is the biggest. I'm sorry, wafer level burn-in AI and then packaged part AI is the biggest.

Maxwell Michaelis
Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division

Okay. So -- and yes, that's just actually, the $60 million to $80 million, the $80 million suggests just greater volume orders from wafer level burn-in...

Okay. And then lastly, I haven't had time to run through the entire press release, but that $5.5 million order you noted in your prepared remarks. Can you go any -- can you share some more detail on that? Is there anything new that we should be looking for? Or is just kind of standard?

Gayn Erickson
President, CEO & Director

You know what, it has a mix of some customers that already had Sonomas that were buying more that were AI related. It had some burn-in modules. That was important because it was for a new design of a really expected to be high runner that's going to production. It has a big order from a what we call our a premier Silicon Valley test services company, we'll leave it to that.

They actually bought a number of the new Sonoma configurations, which are the very high power ones that allow them to go to 2,000 watts. We have some devices that we're going to be testing this spring that are almost 2,000 watts per device, right? And everybody is out there talking about how can you do -- what does it take to get to 1,000 watts, we're jumping right past that. And this is in a high-volume Sonoma system.

So they'll be able to test a large number of devices in that system. And I'm trying -- I think the numbers I should note this number. I think it's 44 devices. But I mean it's a large number of devices to be able to test those. And it's -- by the way, it's either 22 or 44. I should know that. Sorry, folks. Go through the math on that particular application because of the number of resources and power supplies and things. But it's the biggest part we've seen that's in development, and that's going to be going to production. So that's a big deal. So it's a combination of several different orders. Every one of them is kind of sort of strategic to us.

The next question comes from Larry Chlebina with Chlebina Capital.

Larry Chlebina
Chlebina Capital Management, LLC

We try to line up your ramp or at least your demand for the systems that you're working on developing for these customers on the AI processors with what's publicly disclosed in terms of the product launch. Is there a case where they may start up on packaged part wherever they have the capacity to do that. And then when they feel comfortable, maybe if it's after the products launched, would they cut over the wafer level burn-in because it's so much more efficient and saves them money? Would they do that? Or would they just do it initially on a brand-new product launch at the beginning? That's kind of -- do you have a sense of that?

Gayn Erickson
President, CEO & Director

Okay. So I wouldn't -- there's 2 things in there. What I definitely see happening is we know for a fact a customer was doing system level or rack test, okay? The only time they identified infant mortality or early life failures was when it's installed in the data center pretty nasty okay? That's test or not or burn-in. So they said, we'll run it for 2 weeks, and it hasn't died we'll accept it kind of thing, and then they'll actually plug it into the network, pretty expensive way of doing it.

Then there are companies like AEM and Advantest and Teradyne that have talked about system-level test machines, which is a type of ATE machine, that is designed to be doing a high-speed insertion and boot up like the operating system. It's a great way to do a very high degree of test coverage for a specific application.

People were saying, oh, we're going to do burn-in with that. Well, that doesn't really -- those systems are designed for high speed. They're designed to be at the user mode. They're designed to run cold. They're not really designed for burn-in, and they're quite expensive and large.

But the market was pulling on that because it's sure better than doing it in a rack. And there wasn't another system available in what a lot of people refer to us as ovens, which is a large-scale system that you put lots of burn-in modules or trays with lots of devices and test all at once. Those were like from KYC or maybe 600 watts and below or something. And there really wasn't a tool out there for that.

This is where Sonoma was pulled up because we were doing -- Incal was using it for the Hi-Tec operating life, but it's like, well, wait a minute, can I use that in production? Can you add automation? Can you do these things support? And can you quadruple or 50x your capacity?

So that's where Sonoma is coming in. When Sonoma enters that market doing system-level test or rack test makes no sense whatsoever. So it's highly competitive as that. Now having said that, wafer-level burn-in is even better. But a lot of people may say, well, I need to think through that. Where do I put that insertion, I might need to implement some design for test modes to be able to implement it at least to take advantage of the very low cost full wafer contactors from Aehr Test and things like that.

So I think it's an evolution. But I think the conversation we have with customers is they're like, I need package for burn-in, let's talk about that. But boy, wafer-level burn-in would be better, how do we engage on that? And then specifically on a per customer basis, I don't want to get too carried with our strategy. But if you have an installed base of something, a packaged part burn-in systems or I could go in and displace you with maybe Sonoma but it's probably better for me to go displace you with wafer level burn-in because it's not even a price thing in that sense. It's yield. It's so -- or capacity.

So we -- it depends on the customer, and we have some customers that have some devices that want to think about wafer level, something they want to think about package, something they want to think about package and then eventually the wafer level over time. I hope that was -- as I look back, that was pretty confusing. But there's -- it's an evolution of it. And guess what we do, the customer is always right. You tell me what you want and we're in.

Larry Chlebina
Chlebina Capital Management, LLC

Well, if the -- if you -- all these evaluations, they have going on with wafer level burn-in, if it takes longer and the product ends up getting launched, would they still cut over to some portion of the production on wafer level burn-in once it's proven out for the particular product or the predictor -- would they do that midstream?

Gayn Erickson
President, CEO & Director

I think it depends -- I don't -- it's not a slam dunk. I mean, I think traditionally, people will start a product and do the release of that one product on one test platform or something. And then you cut in on the next one. I think that'd be fair to say, but there are certain devices we know that their intended application, there's 2 or 3 different applications for it. So for a large language model, maybe they think about it one way, but if it's going to be automotive, then that's a different thing, right?

So even within a product, there might be an evolution or they get by until they can implement wafer level burn-in. That particularly comes in the fact when you think about a multichip module, right? As soon as you could do wafer-level burn-in, if I could save you 1% yield per die on a 4-die AI processor that has a $15,000 BOM. Of course, you would do that, right?

Larry Chlebina
Chlebina Capital Management, LLC

I'm not sure if they would.

Gayn Erickson
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So we're trying to be as open as we can. We know as much as we know, but there's definitely advantages to do wafer level. I mean ultimately, that's the most -- kind of the best place you could ever do it. And if you implement some DFT and some of the things we do, I can build you a WaferPak in 8 weeks. Have you on wafer.

Larry Chlebina
Chlebina Capital Management, LLC

I'll shift gears on the flash benchmark that you completed right a little bit ago before holidays. When do you expect the customer to get back to you and more importantly, when do you expect them to come with an order.

Gayn Erickson
President, CEO & Director

I was waiting for somebody. Yes, that's where my head's at, too. My guess is, Larry, in the next couple of months or so for them really to get back, depending on how they -- the wafer is going back to test, which is tested at wafer. I don't think they're going to package it up and go through some stress qualification, that might be something. But we've already had some design reviews with them on our new tester and planted the seeds, they were very impressed is how I would describe it. The big trend -- the big shift here was when we even started this thinking to do the benchmark with them, which is what like a year ago, if I get that right.

Larry Chlebina
Chlebina Capital Management, LLC

Yes, over 1.5 years ago.

Gayn Erickson
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Yes. Fair enough, right? When we were starting to even build up to get the design files and what wafer we are going to be testing with them, it was not aimed at high bandwidth flash because that didn't even exist, right? They were looking at it for like commodity data center SSDs. Now with the HBF, it broke their infrastructure, the power supplies, IO pins, et cetera, and parallelism, and now they have a power problem, which we love. Well, we're good at power. So people that have power problems that's music to our ears, so yes.

Larry Chlebina
Chlebina Capital Management, LLC

I recall you originally said the driver, their motivation was as the 3D NANDs got higher levels of -- they're even talking about getting the 400 level.

Gayn Erickson
President, CEO & Director

Layers, layers, yes.

Larry Chlebina
Chlebina Capital Management, LLC

Layers, that required more power and exceed the power in their existing systems so that they need your high power. So here we are 1.5 years later. And so how are they getting by to this point? And don't they need your high-power capability?

Gayn Erickson
President, CEO & Director

They're doing -- they're having to -- they can't test a whole wafer in one touch down as an example. But that -- what I described there, which people -- if you follow along with that, that was actually referred to as hybrid bonded flash same letters by the way, right? Hybrid bonded flash was a novel idea that the base substrate layer was logic done on the logic process and then you build up just the stacked memory, and you do that in a memory process and then you bond them together.

The result of it is that memory stack is a taller building with a smaller footprint, so you get more die per wafer. That's good, right? But the power was much higher, HBF as in high-bandwidth flash is, in some ways, architecturally similar, except for its more power because of its speed it has additional power supplies, and it's taller, it actually is even more of a problem for them, which I guess, if you're a tester guy, the bigger the problem, you have more to solve. But we had to go back and redesign the tester because we were originally aiming it at the other device.

Larry Chlebina
Chlebina Capital Management, LLC

I would think they would need more capacity for the enterprise flash part of it before they ever start needing something for HBF. So the enterprise flash, I'm wondering when is something going to happen there? It seems like it's overdue.

Gayn Erickson
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean our goal, in this case, would be -- we had originally hoped to finish the benchmark at the end of last year, okay? So like we're 6 months later. And I think as shared with you, if you read through all of the notes, around March, it was like it felt like you're pushing a rope, something was going on. If you knew who the company was it'd be the very obvious what was going on, okay?

But that what really happened is they kind of shifted from enterprise focus to HBF. And so that slowed some things down in terms of even reviewing our tester. And then they came back to us in the summer and we're like, okay, here's the new tester we'd like. So okay, maybe that's good. It's for people that you're tapping your fingers, it's taking a long time, but that's part of what happened there. But at this point, again, we walked up there actually -- they thought we were just going to take their wafer and stick it into one of like our NPs with a manual setup and we showed them a fully integrated machine. So they walked up and we put their wafer at a FOP, put the FOP onto the Sierra automated WaferPak Aligner, ran the wafer. It opened up the blade, stick the wafer -- put the wafer in the WaferPaks, put the WaferPaks in the blade, close the blade, ran the tests, gave them the results. It's pretty impressive.

Larry Chlebina
Chlebina Capital Management, LLC

So you're ready to go for production. So it seems like they need. They're going to need more capacity based on everything that's going on in the memory market.

Gayn Erickson
President, CEO & Director

Exactly. And right now, they're all flushed with margins. How is that, right? So I agree, you know what, we've been, Larry, you as people that follow Larry is our greatest cheer leader, along with me in memory strategy for us. We are spending money, okay? It is part of -- as Chris alludes to, we could be doing better, well, at these revenue levels, this is -- we're not happy with these revenue levels, right? We're not making money at these levels. But we would be making more money. We're spending money. We got our foot on the gas. And in fact, it's our expectation that we'll increase the R&D spend particularly in the AI wafer-level burn-in, a little bit in the package because we spent a lot of money on that in just this last year for package getting this new product out and then the memory system which will be a blade in our FOX system basically.

Larry Chlebina
Chlebina Capital Management, LLC

It should be -- it should pay off. Let's -- so hopefully soon, sooner rather later.

Gayn Erickson
President, CEO & Director

I vote yes, too. As a shareholder, I think it's good money to be spent.

[Operator Instructions]. Okay. I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.

Gayn Erickson
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, operator, and thank you, everybody. We really appreciate you guys taking the time to spend an hour with us. I think about that exactly again. And we'll keep you guys updated. Stay tuned. We're really excited about this and hope that the orders will come in shortly enough to be able to make this less dramatic as we go forward and set us up for a really strong year heading into next year. So I appreciate it.

If you are in town, we are in Fremont, California, Silicon Valley, give us call, set something up, come by take a look at the facility. If you haven't seen our tools, they're very impressive and get a feel of the capacity because we have a lot of systems on the manufacturing line right now. So take care, and Happy New Year to everyone.
