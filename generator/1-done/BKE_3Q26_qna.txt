Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Mauricio.

Mauricio Serna Vega
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

This is Mauricio Serna from UBS Research. First, maybe could you speak on a high level what you're seeing on the health of the U.S. consumer coming into the holiday season. There's been some talks about maybe some pressure on the lower income consumer. So I was interested in hearing from your side, what have you been seeing?

And then also, could you speak about the denim business? I think you talked about the momentum in women's being up 17%. What do you -- how do you -- how are you thinking about the sustainability of this growth? And maybe could you talk about what you saw in men's denim demand over the quarter?

Dennis Nelson
President, CEO & Director

Thank you for the question. On the consumer, we haven't seen a big change in our stores. I mean the team and guests seem excited about our product response. There's probably a slight caution in some as our units per sale are off very slightly. But overall, we feel good about it. And if the guest is excited about the product and the quality we have, it's been going pretty well.

The ladies denim business continues to be excellent. There's still a lot of variety of styles and fits. We've added some of our branded sources to the mix, which has added some higher price points, have been good for the business. And our fashion brands and our private brands continue to sell well. So we're optimistic about the gal's denim business throughout the rest of the year.

On the men's denim, our private label brands are consistent and doing well, having good sell-throughs. We haven't seen as much from other brands adding to the private brands mix, but feel our denim business is solid in men's as well.

Great. Just on the other thing that I wanted to ask was the merchandise margin. It was down 10 basis points. Maybe could you elaborate on what were the puts and takes behind the merchandise margin trend in this quarter?

Thomas Heacock
Senior VP of Finance, Treasurer, CFO & Director

Thank you, Mauricio. This is Tom. Yes, merchandise margins were down 10 basis points for Q3 and up 10 basis points for Q2. So I think if you look year-to-date with everything going on with tariffs, we feel really strong about where we're at from a merchandise margin perspective. And we've been operating at a high level of merchandise margins for a long time and have continued to improve that. So both Q1 and Q2 were all-time highs merchandise margins and we were off just a little bit in Q3. So I feel really good about where we're at.

The biggest drivers are really -- Adam called out the decrease slightly in private label business with some of the brands performing really well, especially in women's denim. That's the biggest driver probably of the shift this year and especially Q2 compared to Q3 and then a slight increase in costs with tariffs and other flow-throughs.
