Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question coming from the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.

Linda Umwali
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

This is Linda on for Tom Diffely. My first question is on the market share. Now that your largest competitor just went public, what is your relative size and/or trends in share? Any color there will be very helpful.

Eric Rivera
CFO, VP, Corporate Controller & Principal Accounting Officer

Could you repeat the question, I'm sorry?

Linda Umwali
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Can you hear me now?

Eric Rivera
CFO, VP, Corporate Controller & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes, we can, but we didn't hear the question clearly enough.

Linda Umwali
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Okay. Yes. So my first question was on market share. So with your largest competitor being public now, I was wondering how you're viewing your relative size and trends in the market share versus your competitor?

Eric Rivera
CFO, VP, Corporate Controller & Principal Accounting Officer

So our market share -- thank you, Linda. This is Eric. So we see the market share being as we had perceived in the past, the fact that [ TECHSEM ] now is public helps us get a little bit more detail, but we see our market share being exactly what we thought before.

NIC, they have a little bit more -- they have more market share than we do for sure. When you consider our FPD business that they don't participate in, we're about the same size when you combine them.

Linda Umwali
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

So same size on FPD and different elsewhere?

Eric Rivera
CFO, VP, Corporate Controller & Principal Accounting Officer

So [ TECHSEM ] doesn't participate in FPD, Photronics does. Tech is larger -- has a larger market share than Photronics does -- NIC. However, when you consider our FPD business, we're around the same size.

Linda Umwali
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then looking at the overall competitive environment, what is your view on the overall health of the environment? Yes, any comment there would be helpful.

KangJyh Lee
President of PDMC & Director

Yes. We are seeing a lot of low migration and -- especially in the States. In the past, we have our major operation facilities in Asia. But right now, with the inshoring of semiconductor industry in the United States, our Boise side, which has the high-end capability, we are the only high-end merchant [ mask ] supplier in the country.

And with all the growing high-end demand in the country, we believe we are on the right track to capture more high-end shares. So this also answers your first question that our market share with the growing U.S. demand, especially in the high-end and trusted product, we believe our market share will continue to increase.

George Macricostas
CEO & Executive Chairman

And it will be supported by our investments in our Allen facility as well, which is supporting the reshoring efforts as well.

Linda Umwali
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

That makes sense. And then I also wanted to touch on the mainstream business. You said that there is a continued softness there, but you're seeing it stabilizing. Just curious if you're seeing any kind of -- basically what you're seeing on the supply and demand side of things and how that has impacted margins and maybe how that is impacting your capital spend for next year?

KangJyh Lee
President of PDMC & Director

Our mainstream market, we are referring to mainly our mainstream business in China. As most people are aware that in China, due to the geopolitical issue, they do have some met in China policy. So there are quite a few new local [ mask ] house in China.

However, Photronics as a market and technology leader in China, we try to differentiate ourselves from our local competitors. We are focusing more on our anchor key customers. We build relationship with this key customer with better product quality, support and so on. And also, we utilize our capacity better mainly for a more higher-value product mix.

So I think there are some competition in the mainstream, especially the low end of the mainstream. But with our capability and also with our tour capacity and so on, we are moving ourselves to higher-value product mix.

Operator

Our next question coming from the line of Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum.

Christian Schwab
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

Fantastic quarter. So just a follow-up on the mainstream, is it fair to say that the new market entrants in China on the, I guess, higher -- the less complicated nodes is where you're seeing, I would assume, increased pricing competition?

And so as we think about that business and your shift to higher mix, should we think about that business potentially being under any gross margin pressure? Or should we assume we're going to focus where quality and support and better products stand out and the growth rate there could be a little muted? I guess I'm trying to kind of put all the pieces of the puzzle together.

KangJyh Lee
President of PDMC & Director

Okay. As I reported, in China, right now, there are very strong demand for our high-end product, especially in the 22- and 28-nanometer technology. So for this technology, there are many, many layers in one set of device. So our capacity in our China facility, we are using most of the capacities for the high end, not necessarily for the critical layers, but also for the semi and noncritical layers.

So critical and those noncritical semi-critical layers, actually, they have a much better ASP than the so-called typical mainstream. So in summary, our capacity need to be optimized. And so higher value for higher gross margin and profit margin is our -- the way we are doing business and the way we are working on the market.

Christian Schwab
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

Great. That's clear. And as G8 adoption in flat panel display eventually begins to broaden out into more mainstream applications, your ASPs there are -- I believe they are, anyway, materially higher, given the layer count.

When would you expect that to begin to be a meaningful percentage of that business? Is that something that happens in '26 -- fiscal year '26? Or is that something that's in '27 and beyond?

Christopher Progler
Executive VP of Strategic Planning & CTO

Yes. This is Chris. Yes, so the G8.6 is at the early stage of production ramp. There's only a few fabs that are running that, but we're seeing additional fabs come online actually in multiple regions for G8.6 display.

The application space is just as you said, it's larger format OLED displays and IT, automotive, medical applications. So the application space is fairly broad. So we do expect that to be a strong opportunity for us because we have a leadership position there.

As far as when it will have material impact on revenues and things like that, we don't really want to talk about that here. But I think 2026, you'll see gradual increases in the component of our display revenue driven by G8.6. I think that's all we probably would say at the moment.

Christian Schwab
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

Okay. That's great. And then as we're adding new capacity and geographical expansion and replacing end-of-life tools, I know that brings new capabilities and probably a different pricing structure, is there any puts or takes to gross margin over a multiyear basis, given those significant investments that we should be thinking about?

Eric Rivera
CFO, VP, Corporate Controller & Principal Accounting Officer

Christian, Eric here. So as we invest in our tools, we do so understanding the market and where we see growth being. And basically, we do expect to have increased revenue and as a result, contributions to gross margin. Our CapEx also includes purchases of end-of-life tools, which provide also increased capabilities.

So we do expect to see increased revenue, increased depreciation as well associated with it. We expect our gross margins to continue at the same rate and perhaps grow as we make these investments.

George Macricostas
CEO & Executive Chairman

This is George. It's no different than the past. I mean we've always had end-of-life tools in the past and replacing them, et cetera, I mean the new tools have better throughput, better capabilities, et cetera. So it should not be anything material changes as far as the depreciation that is associated with the new tools.

Christian Schwab
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

Great. Fantastic. And then have you guys -- my last question here, sorry for asking so many. As we ramp up the Allen, Texas facility, can you give us an idea of like revenue potential? I don't need to know exactly where you could give capacity, I can figure it out. But what should we assume the revenue capabilities of additional U.S. capacity over a multiyear time frame could add to the company? Is that fair?

Eric Rivera
CFO, VP, Corporate Controller & Principal Accounting Officer

I understand the question, Christian. So let me address the question into what I can -- I don't want to go to a level of granularity where we're disclosing how much revenue we're going to have by site.

So what I can say is that as a result of these investments, we're going to go into the sort of the mid-range nodes or the higher end of the mainstream, depending on how we define that, right? And we're going to have more capabilities that is going to have incremental revenue and profitability to Photronics in the U.S.

We expect gross margins to improve. We expect revenue to start on these investments towards the second half of the fiscal year '26. And we expect those to continue on to '27 when we're fully ramped.

Christopher Progler
Executive VP of Strategic Planning & CTO

And one other point, Christian, we might make this kind of a knock-on effect to this Allen project in that it will free up more capacity in our Boise site, which is our most leading-edge facility because some of those midrange masks we run there. So as Allen ramps, its revenue, of course, will go up, but the Boise will have more capacity to deploy for higher-end applications. So it's really a combination net benefit of both sites as far as the opportunity.

Christian Schwab
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

Great. Great. No other -- well, let me sneak one more question in. Given the significant reshoring activities that are potentially going to be going on, on a multiyear basis here in the United States, there are certain manufacturers who are going to be adding additional capacity, who source photomasks from outside of the United States, which in some applications, it may seem to me that they might be cost prohibitive to get all the way over here.

Do you have any idea or aspirations that you're willing to share with us what you think the opportunity for captive guys going to the merchant market over a multiyear time frame? Or is that -- am I just saying the obvious because we're adding capacity everywhere? But if there's any clarity on the movement from captive to merchant that you're anticipating other than just semiconductor unit growth, any clarity there would be helpful, I think.

George Macricostas
CEO & Executive Chairman

So to be clear, is your question, do we expect the captives to be entering the merchant market effectively competing with us? Or did I misunderstand that?

Christian Schwab
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

No, I'm saying giving up -- giving market share, looking to merchant market suppliers versus doing it internally. Do you think that, that is a trend that could come to the marketplace, in particular in the U.S. geography?

George Macricostas
CEO & Executive Chairman

I was going to say, I mean, unless it's a capability issue that they can't get it here, I mean, typically, the cycle time is a big issue. They would want to have a more locally sourced -- for cycle time reasons, a more locally sourced mask shop. So I think we have the local advantage. I think the issue could be if there was one, would be under capabilities. But I'll let some of the other folks on the team here chime in.

Christopher Progler
Executive VP of Strategic Planning & CTO

And I think we can broadly answer the question that we've seen over the last year, maybe a little longer, the tendency of the captives overall as a group to look at more outsourcing opportunities. And that's not just in the U.S., that's in other regions as well.

So generally, we're seeing an increase in interest and desire for the captives to outsource. This could be less critical layers of very advanced sets. It could be memory products that historically were done internally.

But let's say, broadly, there's more outsourcing opportunity particularly related to Photronics, we're well positioned in regions that have some of the largest captives and also some of the largest fabs. So we do expect to capitalize on that increased outsourcing trend of captives. I think beyond that, we won't be more specific at this time, but we do see it as an opportunity.

Christian Schwab
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

That was extremely helpful -- go ahead, I'm sorry.

Eric Rivera
CFO, VP, Corporate Controller & Principal Accounting Officer

I'll just add something quickly that, I guess, stating the obvious, right, the regionalization trends, essentially, there will be more fabs making more wafers, they'll need more photomasks. So the trend -- the regionalization trend is only positive for merchant photomask manufacturers like Photronics.

Our next question coming from the line of Gowshi Sriharan with Singular Research.

Gowshihan Sriharan
Singular Research, LLC

Just on that -- I'm glad you brought up that outsourcing issue. How do you guys think about the outsourcing increase in sales? How are you thinking about pricing and margins on those [ lasers ] relative to traditional mainstream IC?

Eric Rivera
CFO, VP, Corporate Controller & Principal Accounting Officer

Well, high end has higher ASPs. Higher ASPs are good. They generally have a higher margin with them. So any outsourcing that comes out of the captives would generally be on the high-end areas.

George Macricostas
CEO & Executive Chairman

And generally speaking, the captives, when they're outsourcing, at least my experience is, they pay. I mean I don't want to say a huge premium, but they're definitely not bottom fishing for what the merchants can give them. Typically, it's -- they're outsourcing and they need it and they're paying a fair price. So I don't see them being overly cost conscious, if I'm making sense.

Gowshihan Sriharan
Singular Research, LLC

Got you. The third question was, you talked a few quarters about how the customers were in holding patents because of tariffs, geopolitics. Setting aside Q1, are you seeing any change in the mix of conversation you're having more long-term planning discussions that would tell you about the sentiment that is quietly improving under the surface?

Eric Rivera
CFO, VP, Corporate Controller & Principal Accounting Officer

Okay. So overall, with respect to -- with respect to the export restrictions, I think that's what you're referring to or the tariffs, I guess that tariffs are both of them. So we're seeing a little bit more easing of that. I think, as you said, customers are -- have understood the landscape and as a result, are able to plan better and as such order.

Now that is true for most areas. Perhaps in China, maybe it still remains the same, the issues that you just described. But for the rest of the world, I think customers have a good plan of where they're going to do their orders. And as a result, we can -- we're there to benefit from that. to?

Christopher Progler
Executive VP of Strategic Planning & CTO

I guess we can also say the 2 projects we've announced, the one in the U.S. and the one in Korea, were based on longer term -- both short- and longer-term conversations with customers on their future demands and the opportunities. So those projects came out of, I would say, a more robust longer-term opportunity dialogue with key customers.

So we are seeing an increase in that, and we're acting on it appropriately by making the right investments in these projects.

Gowshihan Sriharan
Singular Research, LLC

And the high-end IC grew nicely in Q4. How concentrated is that growth towards a handful of programs or customers? And what would you see in the pipeline that gives you confidence that this becomes a broader, more diversified high-end run rate for the rest of fiscal '26?

Christopher Progler
Executive VP of Strategic Planning & CTO

This is Chris. I can make a few comments. I think the high-end growth were basically from our existing core customer base. There are a few new customers, mostly our core customer base that expanded production and capacity as well. So that was memory customers, foundry/logic probably being the strongest and recovery in Asia.

So it's broad-based. It's a broad product mix coming out of foundry and memory, and it's our existing -- mostly our existing customer base, but more robust order patterns that match up to their improving demand cycles as well. So we think it's sustainable. It's consistent with the market generally improving, and we're well positioned with some of the stronger IC players. So we do think it's sustainable.

George Macricostas
CEO & Executive Chairman

And if anything, we see more opportunities there in the high end for sure.

Gowshihan Sriharan
Singular Research, LLC

Got you. And I'll just make this my last question. On Korea, specifically with the capability extension and an increased exposure to the leading-edge chips, how does the commercial model in Korea compared to U.S.? Are the customers inclined to sign longer-term agreements? Or is it a more transactional kind of quarter-to-quarter work?

KangJyh Lee
President of PDMC & Director

We don't want to be very specific on this one. But as Chris just mentioned, our customer, especially the advanced logic foundry customer, they continue their outsourcing policy, not necessarily for the mature node, but going to high end and more higher end. So I think even there are no long-term agreement, but the trend and -- is continuing.

So we do have a lot of conversation and communication with the customer about their roadmap and their outsourcing demand. And that's one of the reasons we are doing the Korea site capacity and capability expansion.

Operator

And I'm showing there are no further questions in the queue. I will now turn the call back over to Ted for any closing comments.
