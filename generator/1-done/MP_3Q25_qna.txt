[Operator Instructions]

Our first question will come from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan.

William Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. I'm wondering, I guess, with your current stockpile, SEG+ stockpile, how long could that support your heavy production once fully ramped? And I guess you talked about engaging with other heavy feedstock suppliers. Are these foreign suppliers, domestic suppliers? I guess in the context of -- you're mentioning that there's not a lot of viable options out there in terms of orebodies. I wanted to get some more context on what type of feedstocks you may have or maybe if M&A may come into consideration.

Ryan Corbett
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, Bill, it's Ryan. I'll start and let Michael take some of that. In terms of the SEG+ stockpile, we have several hundred tons on an REO basis of SEG stockpiled. Obviously, we are producing SEG every single day, and so from that perspective, we feel good about our inventory at this time to be available for us to commission that circuit and charge that circuit. And certainly, as we've discussed, we believe, with our own internal feedstock, we will be able to satisfy the demands of the Independence facility with that.

I'll turn it over to Michael for the rest of the question.

Michael Rosenthal
Co-Founder & COO

In terms of feedstocks, I think one thing we're very excited about is how our fully integrated site with both ore-based processing as well as light and heavy separation gives us -- and recycling gives us like very unique capability in terms of processing different types of feedstocks. So we are in touch with both domestic suppliers, suppliers of recycling material, recycled material, along with some foreign suppliers. Obviously, you see, as much as we do, all of the announcements from various players around the world where we have our opinion on some and are in discussions with many. But I guess we're confident that we will find several different options.

William Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. And then on the magnet business, I guess, how is the customer engagement going beyond Apple and GM? I guess what -- I guess there are people trying to test some of your samples. What's going on with the business for the further offtakes in Independence and then ultimately 10X?

Ryan Corbett
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. It's Ryan again. I think, certainly, since Liberation Day the supply chain mindset across the space has changed very meaningfully. There's a tremendous amount of engagement across really every vertical that consumes magnets, automotive, aerospace and defense, consumer electronics, robotics, you name it. I think, fundamentally, we are focused on executing first for our foundational customers. And from a 10X perspective, we have the luxury of continuing to operate in the same fashion that we have for the last several years given the fact that we have 100% offtake secured for 10X. As we've talked about, our Apple agreement anchors the vast majority of the expansion that we've planned for Independence, and so it puts us in a position where we can continue to be very selective with our customers. But the engagement is quite significant and broadly very exciting.

Your next question will come from Lawson Winder with Bank of America.

Lawson Winder
BofA Securities, Research Division

Nice quarter and once again, a very interesting and fascinating update. May I ask about the -- a couple of things? So just on the heavy rare earths, there's the dysprosium and terbium, 200 kilotons annually. How is that roughly split?

And then secondly, on the heavies, there's the samarium loan. As the name implies, there are other rare earths that the DOE would like to access. What's the time line to producing some of those other rare earth metals that are particularly of interest in the DoD. And has the DoD set any deadlines?

Michael Rosenthal
Co-Founder & COO

This is Michael. Thanks for the question. In our orebody, the general ratio of dysprosium to terbium is about 3:1, so that would be kind of the approximate mix. Some of the other third-party feedstocks and recycled material may have slightly different mix, so ultimate production may differ from that to some extent.

In terms of other heavy rare earth production, we have made a commitment to produce samarium in 2028, so samarium oxide, and we feel very comfortable with that type of time frame. We have made no sort of public commitments to produce any other heavy rare earth, although gadolinium would be a logical next one to produce probably around the same time frame. As for the others, I think we are eager and in discussions with various other parties domestically and in allied countries about offtake of our other materials for them to process into other rare earths. But to the extent there's strong demand or need, we're capable of doing further separations.

Lawson Winder
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. That's very fascinating. And then can I ask about the Apple $200 million prepayment? I had not expected $40 million to be paid in Q3 so quickly. Can you help us understand a time line under which the remaining $160 million would be prepaid?

Ryan Corbett
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. It's Ryan. We are thrilled to surprise you to the upside. We can't get into contract specifics, but certainly, the way this was designed was to continue to provide capital for this build-out as we hit certain operational milestones. We actually expect a next payment of relative scale coming up in Q4. And I think that, over time, as we execute on this plan, we've laid out initial magnet volumes targeting mid-'27 and recycling close behind, you'll continue to see those prepayments on that schedule.

Your next question will come from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Matt, I can see I've unmuted, please go ahead. Unfortunately, we're not able to hear you, Matt. I'll just go to our next analyst, and we'll come back around to you.

Our next question will come from David Deckelbaum with TD Cowen.

David Deckelbaum
TD Cowen, Research Division

Jim, Ryan, and Michael, appreciate the time. Ryan, I think you probably astutely pointed out that the key risk here for MP with incentive prices now is execution. And if I heard right, it looks like -- it sounds like you're targeting the end of '26 for operating NdPr separation nameplate.

Michael, I guess you alluded to some things around just NdPr separation, I guess, kinks that you're ironing out now. So I guess is it fair to say as the contract becomes live now with the Department of War at $110 a kilo, should we think about you guys ramping as quickly as possible in the '26 calendar year? Or can you provide any color around what we should expect in any ensuing quarters from incremental throughput tonnage?

Ryan Corbett
Chief Financial Officer

David, I'll start. It's Ryan. I think the important thing to keep in mind from an economic perspective here is we've talked about our concentrate stockpile, and frankly, for a variety of reasons and now economic reasons, that actually has a lot of value to us. And so certainly, we are focused on ramping as quickly and as smartly as possible to serve the market and to prove out this capability, but it's important to remember that under the PPA, we still are paid for the NdPr content within the concentrate that we stockpile.

Of course, we don't get paid twice. We get paid when we put it into the stockpile, and then once we refine that material, we'll sell it at market prices. But it's a very important value driver for us, and we can continue to look at our view of the market and nominate volumes into that stockpile as we produce them and as we see fit. So that gives us a lot of operational and economic flexibility in 2026 and beyond.

David Deckelbaum
TD Cowen, Research Division

Appreciate that. And then just as a follow-up, I think, Jim, you talked about really the availability of swarfs, end-of-life magnetic products. You guys talked about third-party feed, and I know others have asked you about those questions. But I guess as you think about really addressing the supply chain going forward for your own needs and really internally in this country and for allied nations, where do you prioritize looking at your own capabilities around recycling with obviously the start-up of the Apple facility over the next few years? How do you think about focusing on swarfs and the ability to source that versus looking at third-party feed from orebodies?

James Litinsky
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

I mean I think it's an all-of-the-above approach. Obviously, over the next couple of years, we're maniacally -- we have a number of projects, right? We are scaling Independence. We are getting 10X underway and quickly and then doing the multiple pieces of recycling in Mountain Pass.

As you know, David, this management team is pretty opportunistic, so we will try to take advantage of opportunities out there. I would say that, again, over the next couple of years, it's just executing all of this, and I'd remind you that we have the feedstock to serve our entire 10,000 tons of magnet capacity currently with -- certainly with the Apple piece being part of the deal that they're helping provide feedstock. So we have the, I guess, to use Ryan's words from earlier, the luxury of being methodical about how we think about incremental feedstocks.

Ryan Corbett
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. One important point also, David, to think about -- this is Ryan -- is as we look at sourcing third-party feedstocks, so we look at sourcing magnet material and end-of-life material, I think despite all the focus on price floors, at the end of the day, the economics of this business depend on your cost structure. And so as you see some of these other things announced out there, what you should keep in mind is we will be one of the lowest cost producers of these products, whether refined or from mined material, and that also gives us the opportunity to be thoughtful in the acquisition of third-party feedstock. And so with the platform that we've built, we think we are in pole position to be able to acquire most thoughtfully the best potential feedstocks for the business given the fact that our cost structure will be best in class.

Operator

For our next question, we'll return to Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Matt, I can see that you've unmuted. We're not able to hear you. You may need to select a different microphone input next to your audio button.

Okay. We'll move to our next -- for our next question, we'll hear from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley.

Carlos de Alba
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Can you hear me?

Ryan Corbett
Chief Financial Officer

Yes.

Carlos de Alba
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. Congrats on the strong performance this quarter. Just maybe on the prior response, Jim, can you clarify -- maybe I misunderstood. But are you going to be able to supply recycled material or have capacity in the recycle line above and beyond the 2,000 tons that you have under contract with Apple?

James Litinsky
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Are you referring to -- actually, Michael, why don't you take that and comment?

Michael Rosenthal
Co-Founder & COO

Carlos, if I understand the question, we are building a dedicated line for Apple to manage material and feedback that they are responsible for providing to us. We also will have the capability to process our own swarf, and we'll build that modularly to process as that market grows, which we're very optimistic about additional feedstocks as well over time.

Carlos de Alba
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

All right. Good. Yes. Okay. And it will be a separated line from the one that you were working watching or building on for Apple, right?

Michael Rosenthal
Co-Founder & COO

So the Apple line will be largely separate from our existing line, but the other feedstocks we will -- we are evaluating and will leverage our existing infrastructure and capability in light and heavy rare earth separation in the most thoughtful way possible depending on the nature of the feedstock and customer requirements.

Carlos de Alba
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

All right. Okay. And then, Michael, maybe you can help us understand what is the thoughts about the ramp-up of the Dy and Tb output post-commissioning?

Michael Rosenthal
Co-Founder & COO

Our focus initially is obviously on meeting the needs of our customers and Independence for GM. And because we have this stockpile, we'll be able to produce amounts greater than our initial ore-based material we'd supply on a yearly basis. And then we'll look at what third-party feedstocks we have and what preprocessing is required. But the volumes are obviously relatively modest, so I think the ability to ramp will depend on how quickly we feel comfortable pushing those volumes. Obviously, we have very high quality requirements and need to make sure we perform.

Operator

Our next question will come from Ben Kallo with Baird.

Ben Kallo
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I was wondering how you think about the price floors for heavies as you advise the administration and if you've given any weight to that. I have a follow-up too.

James Litinsky
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Ben, you mean what do we think of them intellectually or -- I would just -- I guess when it comes to heavies, I would -- the one thing -- I think this kind of comes at your question another way. But if we reference back to kind of the overall point that I was trying to make in the prepared remarks, is that when you look at the supply chain in our space and the various areas of it, the heavies area is one where, typically, you have deposits where it makes sense that there are economics where that could be a concentrate or a -- make a concentrate or make a feedstock that can go to a refinery like ours, like we've built.

But typically, at least we haven't seen those sites, the various ones around the world of varying degrees of value where it would make sense economically to build refining capability around that, and so we are really well positioned to accept those feedstocks. And so that's obviously the work that we are doing with DoW to make sure that we have the material for our business through 10X. And so obviously, there are a variety of ways that you can incentivize that upstream production and get economics to those parties to encourage that production. But I do think it is important to think of those as sort of part of a broader supply chain, and there are not necessarily independent, stand-alone economics for sites like that to be a full vertically integrated participant.

Ben Kallo
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

So just a follow-on because you guys have, I guess, everyone's ear, so what is the advice to get the heavies to the admin?

James Litinsky
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I'd like to -- obviously, the detailed advice that we would give to the government, I think we would try to keep that in confidence, and -- but I think I can speak in general terms, which is what I was hinting at, Ben, in my remarks is that when you -- if you look at the structure of this industry and just look at how China has formed, now obviously, a lot of that is state-driven, but a lot of it is sort of structural, is you should think of this industry as closer to a global structural oligopoly rather than just, oh, if we throw a bunch of money at dozens of sites and businesses, we can form a supply chain.

Because the reality is that to have the geology -- we talk through the geology and the differences between lights and heavies and then the complexity of the magnet business. And when you add all of that up, I mean, the best analogies are if you were going into the aircraft production industry or the smartphone industry, would -- think of our great companies like Apple and Boeing right? You wouldn't necessarily say -- if, let's say, it was reversed and you were trying to create those and the Chinese have the competitor, you wouldn't necessarily say let's spread money around to 30 different things.

So I think the way to think about it, though, is we view MP as America's national champion. We have structural advantage because we're fully vertically integrated. We're years and billions ahead of others. And what I would say is if you -- there's various projects out there, both public and private. If you took anything that I'm aware of -- now there may be a bunch of stuff I'm not aware of, but anything I'm aware of, if you gave whatever that was, the deal that MP had, I don't see anywhere where there is any equity value for any of them, public or private.

Now that -- so I think that's a very interesting thing. Now that doesn't mean that the government shouldn't catalyze a lot because I think the government is doing an outstanding job catalyzing private capital to come in. And so to the extent that the government can make investments, whether it's loans or other forms of support and grants, if X dollars of capital can stimulate 2x or 3x in private capital, they should be doing that as much as possible.

So I think we've seen some really great action out of the administration, and so my advice would be to keep going. Keep doing what you're doing. I think they're really thinking about it a thoughtful way. I would just also say that the message of today is for private investors because, obviously, we don't want people to get burned. We want people to think that this is a good space, is to just be very clear eyed about what the actual structural economics are in -- amidst all the excitement.

Your next question will come from Max Yerrill with BMO Capital Markets.

Max Yerrill
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

My question is around the ramp-up of the heavy rare earth separation facility. And I was just wondering if the ramp-up time there affects your ability to deliver certain higher-grade magnets to General Motors. And then I guess the second part is when we look at the universe of potential feedstocks for that heavy rare earth separation, are there types of concentrates that you cannot process? And which ones are the most ideal to the circuit that you envision?

Ryan Corbett
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Sure, Max. It's Ryan. I'll start. In terms of how we're positioned from a supply chain and inventory perspective to support our ramp-up of magnetics, I think we've discussed over the last several quarters that we had anticipated some of the restrictions that had been put in place and have built a stockpile of products to allow us to commission and ramp Independence facility. We've timed the construction and commissioning of the heavy rare earth separation circuit to come online to support further growth as we work that inventory position down.

I'll let Michael take the second part.

Michael Rosenthal
Co-Founder & COO

Just to be clear, the question was on whether types of feedstocks for the heavy rare earth circuit are preferred?

Max Yerrill
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Exactly.

Michael Rosenthal
Co-Founder & COO

Certainly, to the extent we got an SEG+, that would be easier than processing a full mixed rare earth carbonate with lights and heavies. But our circuit can handle because we have all of the capabilities of either one of those. So we will look at the economics and the distribution and compare those to other alternatives.

Operator

Our final question will come from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.

Laurence Alexander
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I appreciate kind of the analogies you've tossed out, and I guess what I want to tease out as you talk about your opportunistic approach to creating value, is the cold war would have gone very differently if the nuclear missiles had a 10-year expiry date? And so when you think about the incentives that a 10-year support program from the DoD -- DoW gives you and also the way the capital markets might perceive that as setting you up for some severe kind of cyclical risk if there's a recession or otherwise, a glut at the end of the 10-year period and what that does to your cost of capital and how you think about your balance sheet, is the strategy here to double down on the Fortress balance sheet, vertical integration and just ride through that transition? Or do you feel either the government needs to make a decision soon about extending the support or you need to make a decision arguably sooner rather than later about adding a second plank to sort of smooth out volatility once you make the transition back into a fully unsupported entity?

James Litinsky
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

So Laurence, I think it's actually the opposite. There's probably -- I don't know how many listeners we have today because there's another exciting call happening where there's a $1 trillion pay plan being proved because we're going to have humanoid robots whether it's Musk or Jensen talking about that. I mean if we look out, and I don't know if it's 5, 10 years, whatever it is, but there's no question that physical AI is going to just create explosive growth in rare earth magnetics. The issue is that, in the very short term, we can't be leveraged by the Chinese from a supply chain standpoint, we've got to have an industry that is here and thriving.

And actually, if you take my remarks, I want to be clear that when I talk about the structural realities, it's not because that is a forever condition. I do think that there's room for a lot of other players and a lot of other supply, but I think that the point is that to get to that 5 or 10 years, you're going to need materially higher prices. So the sort of the MP deal, if you will, I just don't think that's enough. And so I think that what you're really going to see is that, in the very short term, the administration has made sure that we have a successful national champion in MP. We've got to execute, but we are going to sort of open the -- pave the path, if you will, to then figure out how there's much broader supply coming online.

So obviously, 10 years is a long enough time to, not in the short term, think about kind of what that role looks like. We'll think about the next couple of years of getting things online. But I think if we don't have some development in physical AI by then, these -- the markets -- I would be least worried about MP relative to pretty much many other places in the market.

So I don't lose any sleep over what demand is going to look like in 10 years and what NdPr prices and magnetics prices are going to be. I think it's going to be amazing for us. My bigger guess is that we'll have grown our business and move downstream. Just as if you think about us 5 years ago versus where we are today, I think on that roll date, it will not be as material portion of our business remotely compared to what it is today.

Operator

That concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'll now hand the back -- call back for closing remarks.

James Litinsky
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

All right. Well, thank you, everyone. We think it was a great quarter of execution. We are going to get back to work, and I look forward to talking to you all next quarter.
