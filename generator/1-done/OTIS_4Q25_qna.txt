[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with UBS.

Amit Mehrotra
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Judy, maybe you can talk about growth expectations for maintenance and repair within the Services segment for '26? And then how you expect service profits to trend relative to the mid- to high single-digit revenue growth outlook in that segment? And then maybe related to that, anything you could talk about on the progress you're making on retention and churn as well?

Judith Marks
Chair, President & CEO

Sure. Thanks, Amit. Let me talk to the growth expectations. I'll ask Cristina to talk to the profit expectations, and then we'll circle back on retention and what we're seeing. Listen, we ended the year, obviously, at a 5% service top line growth, and we were targeting a little bit higher on repair, although we did see our repair trajectory stabilize and actually be much better in the second half than the first half.

As we go into this year, we are expecting our repair rates to ramp up to be 10% plus. So that will bring maintenance and repair up higher, and we're actually expecting at least a point gain in maintenance as well. That -- take that with modernization backlog conversion, and that's why we felt that we would be 1 to 2 points higher, and we have line of sight to that with our backlog. Cristina?

Cristina Mendez
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And Amit, on the profit and margin rate side, so this acceleration of top line should also flow through profit, and we expect an acceleration of service contribution in the year. In '25, we contributed BPY versus previous year, $150 million at constant currency. In 2022 -- 2026, this is going to be $200 million. So very consistent with the acceleration of dollar profit strategy that we have been selling over time.

And look, when you look back, we have delivered a very strong performance in our service business consistently in the last 5 years. We have grown service margins by 40, 50, even 60 basis points every year. We are expecting margin expansion again in 2026. This is on the back of growth in volumes, -- we also are improving our price capabilities being much more adapted to customer demands, much more smart pricing. We also have the benefits of productivity and the uplift run rate.

On the headwind perspective, we have the investments we are placing in the stabilization of the cancellation rate that Judy will talk to in a minute. But we are very positive about the results of these investments in 2025. So we will continue selectively investing in customer excellence. All in all, very strong service performance expected for 2026.

Judith Marks
Chair, President & CEO

Yes. Listen, I couldn't be more pleased with our service teams. And I think we are. I'm convinced we're making the right investments in service quality and service excellence. It matters to our customers, and it will, as we've said, all throughout 2025, make a difference in retention rate in '26, '27 and '28. Our goal in '25 was to stabilize that retention rate after seeing a decline from '24 to '25.

And ex China, we're pleased to say that we've done that. And now we expect small growth to start yielding in '26. But what I would tell you is we're very focused on several key markets. We want to ensure that we are retaining the right units in our portfolio. Having the largest portfolio is wonderful at 2.5 million units, but we want to make sure that every unit is not just accretive, but we continue to retain the key units that have the largest profit contribution.

In the past we've grown in more of the emerging markets. So while the portfolio may not grow at the same rate in 2026 at that 4% that we're very proud of, it will grow in terms of the value it contributes. Where you'll be able to measure that, Amit, and everyone listening is in our maintenance revenue. You'll be able to measure it in our repair revenue, which is where it will show up. And then we'll share retention trends as we go through the year.

Amit Mehrotra
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And just as a quick follow-up on the new equipment margins. Maybe just a question on how much do you think this trajectory is structural versus cyclical? Obviously, the China market, which is your highest margin new equipment market is tough. So maybe it's just cyclical. But obviously, there's a need to capture more service revenue. So I'm just trying to understand the price competition there and whether you can bounce that trajectory back up if you get some macro tailwinds.

Cristina Mendez
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. No, look, Amit, on the New Equipment side, the new Equipment segment is a very small piece of our business, and it will become smaller as we continue executing our service-based strategy. The margins are going to be a headwind in 2026 because of the ongoing decline of volumes, mainly coming from China. And as you know, China is our highest margin geography. We have the benefits from the China transformation restructuring and uplift, but most of the benefits are in the baseline.

The run rate from China transformation is EUR 20 million smaller in the year-on-year basis than in 2025. Commodities are also a small headwind, very small in the broader scheme of things on annual spend in this category. But it is a matter of navigating through the backlog and stabilizing the New Equipment segment. in margin rate terms, we expect 2026 to land at the same rate of Q4 2025.

Your next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo.

Joseph O'Dea
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Can you add a little bit more color around the service margin in the fourth quarter? And when you get 100 bps year-over-year growth, think about mod as being kind of the lowest margin within that portfolio, repair being the highest, repair was a little lighter than you expected. And so when you think about maybe some of the mix components within that, that wouldn't be helpful. And so what you're doing to drive the margin expansion in each one of those individual pieces and specifically what you were able to achieve in mod margins?

Judith Marks
Chair, President & CEO

Yes. Let me let Cristina go through some of the specifics, Joe, but let me start by saying when you think about it, we've -- as we've seen this impending opportunity in modernization, we've known that, that has the potential, obviously, to be dilutive to the Service segment. The good news is with the repair volumes growing and they ended the year at 5%, they're still growing at a larger -- even though the rate is 5%, it's a larger bucket of core revenue to grow on than mod.

I will tell you, though, we strategically have focused on modernization, seeing this large market that was going to continue to grow, as we call it, almost evergreen. And so we industrialized our modernization approach. We've integrated it into many of our new equipment factories. We have a common supply chain. So we're getting scale benefits. We have dedicated and specialized installers, specialized sales reps. And now that the modernization scale is starting to emerge, we're seeing the margins grow as well.

So we're pleased to say, again, the modernization margins are getting much closer to the 10% medium-term target we set. Originally, we had talked about first surpassing New Equipment margins. We've done that. Now we're at the point where it should be more than double new equipment margins, even if new equipment margins are typically around 5%. So we came very close to that as we ended the year. And I think with more scale, you'll see more of that.

Just one specific call out though, on modernization revenue growth. We did see it pretty much everywhere. But our China team because of the Mod bond stimulus program had significant orders in the third quarter, and their orders were up over 35% for the year, pretty flat in the fourth quarter because they happened earlier this year. But our mod revenue in China, Sally and the team really turned the revenue very quickly.

And that revenue grew 100% in the fourth quarter year-over-year and was up 75% full year. So mod margins look strong in China, just like the New Equipment margins do, but let me let Cristina add some more comments.

Cristina Mendez
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Joe. So I can give you more color of the components below the 100 basis points margin expansion in service. And let me start by saying we are very pleased with this strong performance and encouraged by the ability to continue growing service margins in the future. So as Judy pointed out, repair accelerated and repair has the highest margin within the Service segment. Modernization margins are ramping up.

We increased 50 basis point modernization margin quarter-over-quarter, Q4 versus Q3. And there is a third component that is a onetime effect of the sale of assets of a few transaction of service centers. This is related to our service transformation strategy. We are changing our operating model, as you know, and we are thinking on models that will benefit customer experience by reducing lead time in the delivery of spare parts.

So we have sold a few service centers because we are outsourcing to a third party that can handle the process more efficiently, and this was $14 million in the quarter, 14. If we exclude this effect, service margins would have expanded 40 basis points, which is still a very solid expansion.

Joseph O'Dea
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then there's -- is there a go-forward benefit from the transactional service centers effects that took that contribution in the quarter is a run rate contribution? Or was it more onetime in nature?

Judith Marks
Chair, President & CEO

Yes, that was more onetime in nature, but the benefit will be retention rates because, again, it wasn't core for us to be managing some of our own spare parts. We have a third party now that, that is their business, better central location for that for quicker and more efficient spare parts delivery, so we can get the right part to our mechanic to repair the unit in a shorter cycle time.

Joseph O'Dea
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Okay. And then could you just talk a little bit about the China stimulus program with a little bit of color on how that's grown. And so if we go back to kind of when it started and the size of it, what the size of it was in '25 and how you're thinking about it in '26?

Judith Marks
Chair, President & CEO

Sure. And it's still -- it's young and yet it's continuing to evolve. The whole focus was actually twofold from the Chinese government when this was started in about mid-2024. It was to make living more attractive for Chinese citizens, especially those that were getting older in some older residential buildings and also to drive consumption as part of the government's focus on driving consumption in a deflationary environment.

In 2024, the size of the program was about 80,000 units that could be modernized, again, fully funded by the government, but needing to be supported by local governments where they would put forward the number of units they wanted to do. That ramped up to 120,000 in 2025. And I think our team from a share perspective, without giving any numbers, did an excellent job capturing the market due to our customer connections, our agents and distributors and our relationships.

And we did deliver all of our units in year, which is a key element of the program. And that's really what drove it. Again, full stimulus fully funded by the government. The government itself has said that program will continue in 2026 at, at least the level comparable to 2025. We've not seen if it's going to increase yet. We're obviously watching signals because right now, it was a value program where we would fit solutions to fit that RMB 150,000.

We believe that there's been a rational assessment of, well, if you have taller buildings that need more content and more equipment, maybe we should have different levels versus just one value. So we think it's going to continue to evolve, but we view it as positive in 2026. It should look at least like 2025, and our Otis team is prepared to capitalize on that.

Your next question comes from the line of Nick Housden with RBC Capital Markets.

Nicholas Housden
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

My first one is on modernization. So the backlog was up 30%, which is a very strong number. And you've discussed how you've been industrializing your modernization business. So it would be good just to kind of understand how you think about the annual growth potential in that business in the next couple of years because I don't think any of us are expecting sort of 30% numbers, but just thinking about how you kind of pencil in the acceleration in that business.

Judith Marks
Chair, President & CEO

Yes, Nick, thank you for asking. We've seen this market starting to grow and now it's growing at some pretty healthy rates. I shared in my opening comments, we think the market segment grew 13% in 2025. And you could tell from the arrow that's going to continue to go up. It's not as well instrumented in terms of segment measures as the new equipment market, where most of the providers share information to a neutral third party.

So some of this -- most of this is actually based on our own estimates. But we are seeing demand increase. We originally started in this market primarily with full replacements. But in lots of discussions, remember, half of the installed base is residential, multifamily across the globe. In so many discussions with our customers, they were looking for alternative ways to phase this in over time.

So earlier in the year, we introduced our ARISE package set in EMEA, which has the largest population of aged units because just due to the aging in Europe and the building construction cycles. And between the full replacements, the mod bond stimulus in China, and again, these partial replacements that let people with our tools budget for this and do it over multiple years and have less disruption in office buildings and other places, we are seeing this market pick up significantly.

If you look even this year on our orders, first quarter, we were up 12%; second quarter, 22%; third quarter, 27% and 43% in the fourth quarter. I mentioned Transport for London. That is a major several decade-long project between maintenance and modernization that we'll be doing for the London underground. So we have a combination of volume business and major projects business. So I don't believe you'll see us convert that 30%, I know for sure, in 2026 because there are multiyear major projects in there, too.

But we see a steady growth rate in the market. and it is growing in every region and every country where we do business, which gets us excited. Lastly, just in terms of the how, we did specialize our sales force for this. We created packages, so it's easier to show the value proposition for our customers. We provide capital planning tools so they can get ready financially. Then we have the operations side ready, as I mentioned earlier, and then the installation side.

What we want to do is become very productive and have a lot of -- and I think we are getting through the learning curve with our installation crews. And then we believe this will then have the ultimate benefit of the conversion and the retention on service. So for us, modernization, it's another lubricant on the flywheel but it will drive its own significant revenue stream and margin and more importantly, profit contribution in the near term. And I think planning it in the teens, if not more, is an appropriate place to plan.

Nicholas Housden
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

That's great. And then my second question is I was just wondering if we could maybe unpack the EPS outlook a little bit more. It looks like it's slightly below what the market was expecting in mid- to high single digits. I'm just wondering what it will take to get back to the kind of 10% plus ambitions that you've previously discussed at Investor Days. Mod growth this year should be good. You mentioned repair. I think you said growing 10% this year. There's an FX tailwind as well. So kind of seeing potentially only mid-single-digit EPS growth in that guidance was maybe looked a little conservative to me. So just curious to hear your thoughts there.

Judith Marks
Chair, President & CEO

Yes, I have -- I will have Cristina. Listen, we chose to be conservative. I just want to be very transparent about that because we -- yes, we just want to make sure that what we commit, we deliver. And anything we continue to do, which we'll be happy to talk about above and beyond that, we will deliver that to our shareholders as well. But we did choose to start conservative for the year.

Cristina Mendez
Executive VP & CFO

And from the components perspective, we -- the midpoint of the guide, Nick, is 6% EPS growth that is around $0.23. The operational component of that growth is much stronger in '26 than in 2025. We are increasing from $0.09 year-over-year growth in '25 to $0.15 in 2026. And this is on the back of the acceleration of operating profit in service. As I said before, service operating profit is going to grow $200 million at constant currency in the year. On the other side, we have FX that is a little bit favorable. We are talking about $0.08 in 2026.

And it can be even more favorable because we are assuming euro at $1.18. And yesterday, the spot was $1.20. So the stronger FX, the more EPS we will deliver. Below the line, we expect this to be roughly flattish because we have the headwinds of the interest rate that is essentially the refinancing of the debt that comes mature and interest rates are now higher than 5 years ago. But we have the ongoing benefits from share buyback, $800 million guided for the year and a little bit positive on the tax rate. We are expecting to finish the year at 24.5%.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with Morgan Stanley.

Christopher Snyder
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I wanted to ask about maybe the margin opportunity if we look beyond '26. The company has delivered really impressive margin expansion over the last 2, 3 years without much help from the market. But a lot of that was driven by the restructuring programs, both the uplift savings and the China transformation savings.

I think over the last '24 to '26, you guys have in the slides that it was, I think, $240 million. So I guess my question is, what is the ability here to expand margins as we look beyond these restructuring programs and just kind of more on a core operational basis for the business?

Cristina Mendez
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Chris. So first, let me comment on the restructuring program because definitely, they have been a tailwind in margin, but we have also navigated a significant deterioration of the new equipment market worldwide, particularly in China. So when you look at our top line, new equipment has been a drag in growth of $400 million-ish in '24, in '25, and we are expecting to trend towards a stabilization, still around $100 million-ish this year, although it can be better depending on China because China has shorter book and ship.

So it's true that we have those tailwinds, but they have also helped us to navigate the situation regarding new equipment. On the other side, I want to emphasize the strength of our service business. On service, we continue delivering margin expansion beyond uplift. And that's thanks to the increased productivity. We are proud to be best-in-class in the industry in our productivity. We are also connecting units with IoT, more than 1.1 million or 1.1 million units connected in 2025.

And as we continue growing the portfolio, we will have more density and more productivity. In addition to that, pricing should also help to expand margin rates because pricing has a higher flow-through in profit. And we have a few pricing actions, again, very targeted to adapt our price to customer demand that will benefit in '26 and beyond.

Judith Marks
Chair, President & CEO

Yes, Chris, I would just sum it up to say without top line growth, we've achieved this margin expansion and this profit contribution with just think what we can do, not just think our plan is to drive growth in our company. You were going to see -- we did not have top line growth. We were flat this year. A lot of reasons, but it doesn't matter. We were flat. We are obviously showing we're going to have top line growth in terms of sales. And with that, that profit flow-through will be visible.

Christopher Snyder
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I really appreciate that. If I could maybe follow up on the conversion of modernization orders. So mod revenue has obviously been very good, but orders and backlog have been even better for a while now. So I guess kind of my question is, can you just kind of maybe talk about that mod conversion cycle? I would imagine it's faster than the new equipment market. But any color there because it does feels like backlog and orders have been running ahead of revenue for some time now.

Judith Marks
Chair, President & CEO

You're accurate, Chris. And we're just -- we continue to build up that backlog -- in our guide this year, the mod revenue will be in the teens, certainly 10% plus as the volumes accelerate. That works really what your assessment on you think it's quicker than new equipment. It is when we're doing a volume mod, a small mod, certainly a partial mod, but even a volume full mod, we can do that relatively quickly.

But I would tell you that when we go to not just major projects, but even office buildings, commercial locations, hotels where there's a bank of elevators or multiple elevators or infrastructure where there's multiple, we only can really take 1 or 2 out of service at a time. So even though we're not held up by a construction cycle or a general contractor because we're the general contractor, it's about interruption in the building.

So some of these major projects actually take longer than a new equipment job as do some of the ones where we have kind of a common bank if you're in a hotel, you're only going to modernize one at a time so that you don't disrupt traffic flow or have a lot of general work going on. So it's a little different mix than new equipment. On the cash side, it looks good because it's -- we get the advanced payments and we bill as we go.

On the revenue side, it's -- we'll do POC accounting in terms of how we do the sales. But there is this blend. And in the -- we are pushing hard, all of our regional leaders know, all of our field leaders know. We're pushing hard to convert the volume as quick as possible so that we can get ready for more. And it should be in the teens in terms of '26 and beyond.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.

Jeffrey Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Judy, I was wondering if you could just dial us in a little bit more precisely on China just to sort of level set the base and what is the actual expectation for 2026. You just kind of spoke to it directionally. But maybe just how the market ended in units, what you're actually expecting for the 2026 decline? And is it sort of a decline in the first half and then a stabilization in the back? Any color there would be helpful.

Judith Marks
Chair, President & CEO

Yes, happy to, Jeff. So it's interesting. This time last year, we sat here and we said -- and I said that the market would start its stabilization as we got to the second half. And that is indeed what we saw. The market in '25 was down 15% for the first half. 10% for the second half. We believe the market ended at about 370,000 if I round up just a little units for 2025.

You know we've changed our strategy there, but let me finish on kind of where we see the market this year. Our view is that as opposed to if you take between the 15% and 10%, let's say, 2025 was 13% down. We think this year will be about 8% down. We think in the first quarter, maybe second quarter, we'll see that similar minus 10 and we think we'll end the year closer in the market being down to minus 5 -- so you can do the math in terms of it being down about 8% in terms of the segment.

In terms of our strategy and what we've done, listen, I think the team has done a phenomenal job in the fourth straight year of decline. Our service in the fourth quarter, we continued to grow our service business, both maintenance, repair. You heard me talk about Mod earlier. Service now, as we exited in the fourth quarter was 47% of our China sales, which was 42% in the third quarter. And you'll recall at spin, it was in the mid-teens.

So we have been going through this transformation of our China business to not be as dependent on that. China, in terms of global revenue, China represents 11% for the year of our total Otis revenue. It was at 12% in the fourth quarter. and it's now 19% of our new equipment revenue in the fourth quarter versus 21% in the third quarter. So the rest of the business is growing healthy.

Our China team has done an amazing job at being able to stabilize our business, and they've added connected units. They've continued on productivity. And we're really interested in hearing what's going to happen in the March meetings that are happening after the 15th 5-year plan was announced at the Fall Plenum. We believe that in Volution focus will help with competitive pricing, hopefully starting to stabilize that. The Mod bond will help us, and we believe there will be a continued focus on how do you get consumption started in the property markets. But that's kind of the China picture for you, Jeff.

Jeffrey Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Yes. No, that's great color. And then could you also just address kind of where OE versus service margins are way back when, right, we used to think of new equipment margins actually higher than service. I think there's some debate on whether or not that was actually the case. But you did note that China is still your highest margin region overall. So I just wonder if you could give us a little more perspective on that also.

Cristina Mendez
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Jeff, they remain the highest margin -- the highest region in margin because we have restructured the organization to adapt the cost to the new volumes environment. On the other side, service margins are expanding over time because I think that they are growing very strongly in modernization.

And modernization margins are kind of at the same level as new equipment. So as modernization goes up, in the case of China, that is going to be a tailwind in the margin rate. So -- but yes, directionally, in line with what we have said before, New equipment high, service lower, but getting better.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.

Nigel Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Cristina, maybe I can clarify with you. The 1Q guidance, is that flat with 1Q last year? Or is that 4Q?

Cristina Mendez
Executive VP & CFO

It's flat versus Q1 last year. And Nigel, let me give you some color about the different segments. So on the one side, Sales is going to continue accelerating all the year along starting in Q1. We are expecting in service 6% sales. You may remember that last year, we had a weaker service top line growth, particularly in repair. It was 1% in Q1 last year. It's expected to be around 10%. We also have an easier compare, but we continue accelerating, while modernization will be in a steady growth on the back of the 30% backlog.

From a profit standpoint, we expect profit at actual FX to be around flat with EUR 20 million FX tailwinds. The reason for that is on the new equipment side, we didn't have tariffs last year in Q1. They came into place into Q2. You have also seen weaker execution in U.S. new equipment in Q4. This has been delayed to Q1. So we have kind of a compound effect of the compare plus tariffs moving into Q1.

On the service side, although we continue growing the top line and the acceleration of repair is a tailwind in margin, we also have a tougher compare in contribution because of investments. You may recall that last year, we started the service excellence investments in Q2. So when you compare to Q1, we don't have that in the baseline. But overall, margin is going to be around 16% in Q1.

Nigel Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. That's helpful. That -- I just want to clarify that with you there. And then for the full year, you're indicating new equipment margins down probably 100 basis points or so for the full year. I think your plan is pretty flat margins overall. So should we think about it as, I don't know, a bit of inflation on corporate Service margins up 20 basis points. Is that how you think about it?

Cristina Mendez
Executive VP & CFO

Well, you got it right in the sense that margins are going to be around flat. But looking into the segments, as I said before, service is going to expand margins very strongly again in 2026. Total operating profit growth for service is going to be $200 million. On the new equipment side, this is indeed a headwind for us.

And the reason for that is that the China transformation benefits were mainly captured in 2025. So the run rate is $40 million in total, only $10 million incremental run rate in 2026. At the same time, we continue executing the backlog with a more competitive price and volumes are regularly stabilizing, but they are planned to be revenue in New Equipment low single digit down to flat.

From a corporate standpoint, we expect to be at the same level as Q4. So Q4 is a good run rate for you to take. And you need to consider the impact of inflation, and we have some small impact of transactional FX that is related to the hedging of our intercompany activity. It's a technical thing we can cover offline, but it's essentially leaving the run rate as per Q4.

Nigel Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. So just to clarify, Cristina, it sounds like new equipment margins close to 3% for the full year?

Cristina Mendez
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I would say slightly below 4%.

Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.

Julian Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I just wanted to circle back to the service business for a second there. And just trying to understand kind of if we take the total company in service, I think you had 92% retention end of 2024. Where is that sort of ending 2025? And I think, Judy, you mentioned the 4% portfolio unit growth may be tough to sustain. Just wanted to understand why that's the case as you are investing a lot more in service headcount and so forth.

Judith Marks
Chair, President & CEO

Yes, Julian, the 4% is not tough to sustain if we choose to sustain it with more emerging markets and lower contributing units. What we're trying to do is focus on growth and growth in value as well. So the retention rate actually ex China, which we didn't share last year, but actually is -- we say stable. I would say I was pleased with what we were able to do through the year. We stopped it from eroding when you think about the Americas, Asia Pacific and EMEA.

And now we're at the point with these investments and with our customer focus where we think that will now actually become stronger, but not by a point in '26, but it should pick up a little bit. Obviously, China is a little different structural. But please understand, I mean, we could continue to add units to the portfolio.

This is a conscious decision we're making -- and it's not that 4 is going back to the 1 we had perennially, but it might be -- it might start with a 3, but it's going to be a 3-plus percent, but it's going to be units that actually drive more top line in terms of maintenance value, in terms of the repair we'll get from it and the eventual mod.

Julian Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

That's helpful. And then just wanted to put a finer point on the -- how we should think about the EPS sort of phasing for the year. So I think it's up $0.23 for the year as a whole. That's all coming between the second and fourth quarters because Q1 is flat EPS year-on-year. Any help you could give us how to think about the phasing of that $0.23 increase in the remaining 9 months, please?

Judith Marks
Chair, President & CEO

Yes. And I'll just remind you, this year, it was $0.03 for the first half and then $0.09 for Q3 and $0.10 for Q4. So our intent is not to have to depend on the full second half again. But there will be an increase regardless of the compares, but you should start seeing it much more in the second quarter than you did last year.

Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.

Robert Wertheimer
Melius Research LLC

Judy, you've touched on service and service excellent investments a couple of times. I wonder if you could just, in a general sense, talk about where you feel you are now versus where you want to be? Have you gotten there and you're starting to see results? Is there more investment to come? And maybe there's a margin kind of a theme attached to that question. And then I wonder if there's any new technology or new tools that are developing throughout the year that might add to your ability to lead that segment.

Judith Marks
Chair, President & CEO

Yes. No, Rob, we anticipate continued productivity from our incredible now 45,000 field professionals. They represent us every day in front of customers, and they are, as I always say, the heart and soul of our company. We will be continuing to provide more tools and technology for them because the answer for us to continue growing, we cannot just instantly create new mechanics.

They go through an apprenticeship. These are professionals. This is what they commit to. So whether it's our robot that's doing inspections that we showed in China, other AI tools that let us handle parts identification more efficiently, even -- obviously, the application of Otis ONE, I'm so excited about where that's going in '26 to give us better predictive maintenance and to make our mechanics first-time fixed rate even more efficient. So all of that should help us in terms of how we go about the year. The first part of your question, I'm sorry.

TThat was it largely -- but have you reached kind of max investment and now over the next 2 or 3 years, you start to lever it? Or how do you think about that?

Judith Marks
Chair, President & CEO

Yes. I think -- I can tell you the investment is still underway. especially and it's planned for '26, which is a little bit part of the EPS bridge that Cristina took you through because having been in this business for 172 years, we understand the value of long-term customers, and we knew we needed to improve our service delivery. So that investment is still underway.

It's happening at -- and basically, what we're doing is we're applying more mechanics and more field professionals in locations where the performance has not been satisfactory, even though we may not be billing them, but we're trying to improve that service, retain that customer. It's an investment we think is extremely worthwhile, and it's going to continue to play out this year, and we believe the returns will be seen for many years to come.

Your next question comes from the line of Kyle Summers with Rothschild & Company.

Kyle Summers
Rothschild & Co Redburn, Research Division

I just want to start on the repair side. Could you just go into a bit more detail as to how the investment into service excellence led to the lower-than-expected repairs? And then why shouldn't we see this reoccur in 2026?

Judith Marks
Chair, President & CEO

Yes. Well, all I can tell you is the repair backlog is growing, which from a financial perspective and how you look at it, you look at it positive. From a customer service perspective, you don't want to wait too long for repair. So we need to increase the conversion rates on our repair, and you're going to see us be more proactive repair in terms of sending out solutions for our customers before they ever experience the problem. But I'll let Cristina talk to the rates.

Cristina Mendez
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Kyle. And I will add that, as Judy said, the repair backlog is growing and the demand is there. It's a matter of how we distribute our field colleagues in order to execute all the activities in the quarter that are in the case of service, maintenance, repair and modernization. So as we entered the quarter, we knew how many field colleagues we had because the onboarding process is longer than 3 months. But we also monitored regularly the quality indicators. And as we see the need to put more field colleagues on maintenance in order to better support customer and satisfaction, we calibrate during the quarter resources from the different activities. So it's not a backlog or demand issue. It's a matter of calibrating resources according to the best use of them.

Judith Marks
Chair, President & CEO

And I think we are getting better at that every day and every week at all of our operating territories.

Kyle Summers
Rothschild & Co Redburn, Research Division

And then just on the retention rate. So obviously, good to see it stabilizing. outside of China, but obviously, the total rate has still declined. Can you just provide a bit more color as to what exactly is going on in China and how you aim to stabilize the declines there? And then just adding on to that, you mentioned slight improvement into 2026. Is that for the total group? Or is that still ex China?

Judith Marks
Chair, President & CEO

So listen, we expect everyone to participate in continuous improvement in everything we do. So I wouldn't just call out ex a group for improvement. There's room for everyone to improve. China is pretty simple. Every year, every contract is up for renewal, and there's no ability to have any sort of auto renewal in the structure of how China does business for everyone, not unique to Otis. So it is every year continuous, you have to prove yourself, you get repriced. It's just -- it's a very different structural system.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.

C. Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I'm not sure if we have the numbers right on the conversion rate in China. It seemed like it was substantially lower than what you guys have been reporting in the past, just the math on that, if you could confirm that. And then I guess just combining that with the attrition and delving a little bit deeper into Jeff's line of questioning, is there just something now like structurally different with this China aftermarket that the price pressure is kind of intensified from the OE into the services now. And so that's just something you're -- like you said, you're kind of walking from a value perspective. Is that just a higher level? Like is that the mosaic there?

Judith Marks
Chair, President & CEO

Yes. Let me answer both. So the China, there's 2 things going on here, Steve. One is we are -- and we're kind of in flight. So we've got orders in the backlog that we won competitively that we won through our agents and distributors. And some of these are not in the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities where we choose to focus because of the contribution. We get better density there. The contribution makes sense.

So we've obviously delivered them. New equipment margins are good. But we're -- we understand if that customer chooses to go with another service provider, and we allow that to happen. Separately, on recaptures, we use that same filter. So it's not -- we don't want to recapture everything across the whole country.

We want to recapture the units. So new equipment, we want the units that will give us the lifetime service or certainly a better service stickiness in service recaptures, we're very targeted now. So I think you're seeing not structural but strategic Otis decisions that will -- it might impact the rate, but it will give us a healthier portfolio in China.

C. Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And are we right about the conversion rate being like...

Judith Marks
Chair, President & CEO

It is lower. It is.

C. Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And that should remain kind of in that level going forward?

Judith Marks
Chair, President & CEO

Yes, I would expect a little improvement, but it will remain lower, yes.

C. Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then sorry, one last one, just on price cost. What is the kind of thought on that this year? I know steel obviously has been a bit volatile. What are you guys looking for kind of on a spread basis this year?

Cristina Mendez
Executive VP & CFO

We would expect the same trend as we have seen in 2025, Steve. So rest of the world, excluding China, will have positive low single-digit price. China will remain challenged around 1, 2 points down sequentially quarter-over-quarter.

Judith Marks
Chair, President & CEO

Yes. I'm not as worried about commodities, Steve, with how we manage it locally and then how we lock it in. Obviously, we're watching steel, copper, but it's not a significant number for us in terms of a headwind this year.

And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn it back over to Judy for closing comments.

Judith Marks
Chair, President & CEO

Thank you, Krista. 2025 marked another year demonstrating the strength and resiliency of our service-driven strategy. This foundation and service, together with a robust backlog for modernization and new equipment gives us confidence in driving meaningful growth in 2026 and beyond. Thank you again for joining us today. Please stay safe and well.

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.
