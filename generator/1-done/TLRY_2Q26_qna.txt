Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Bill Kirk with ROTH Capital Partners.

William Kirk
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

On the intoxicating hemp bans for November implementation, is there anything Irwin that the industry can do to try to help improve the regulatory outcome? Is there any way to kind of extend the grace period, reverse the ban, carve-out particular categories? Like what can you do or what can the industry do to get a better outcome there?

Irwin Simon
President, CEO & Chairman

Thank you, Bill. Great question. As you know, this, for us, was a growing business and there is a lot of demand for these products. And we are working with some congressmen, senators, lobbyists to either extend the deadline or to change some of the regulatory that would have a regulated amount of milligrams, whether it's 5 or 10 milligrams and to be sold on a national basis. And I'll tell you, so far, I have a really good feeling because we're talking to the different associations other than Senator McConnell and whoever backed him, there's no one out here against this and thinks this is something that should be banned.

The other thing, Bill, just the other thing, I mean, there's a lot of jobs that will be lost if this happens which is something very important too.

William Kirk
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

For sure. Carl, you had some comments about holding back supply and shifting it into international markets. Am I hearing that right that, that would mean sales that could have been in this quarter simply come later? And is there a way to quantify how much was held back?

Carl Merton
CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

So what I said was that we held back from the Canadian wholesale market at lower pricing than what we did in the prior year. And so last year, we did about $5 million. We obviously have the inventory levels that we have that are on the balance sheet that we could have -- that we can redeploy into European markets over the next 6 months of this year.

Irwin Simon
President, CEO & Chairman

So it's just redeploying better margin sales, Bill, where we can sell it into Europe and get much higher margin for it than selling it into the wholesale market where we don't get the margins and in some cases, we're even selling to a competitor. So that's what it is.

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Securities.

Xin Ma
TD Cowen, Research Division

This is Victor Ma on for Rob Moskow. Two for me, please. First, I wanted to ask about Canadian adult-use cannabis. Growth in the quarter was about 6%. How much of that was volume growth versus price mix? Did you gain market share in the quarter? And then second, can you give a little more color on what drove the substantial increase in distribution sales? Was there any timing benefit that was realized in the quarter?

Irwin Simon
President, CEO & Chairman

So number one, absolutely, there was not price. Some of it came from new distribution, if anything. It was a strike in British Columbia that ultimately hurt us. And we did gain a little bit of share, not a lot in the quarter. So it's demand. I think there's a lot we did in different markets. A lot of our new products started to roll out. And -- so that was the big reason from our growth, having supply.

And I think just the team has done a great job. This is the highest quarter in us, in selling the units 5.5 million units that we sold in the quarter. So again, if anything, throughout the rest of the prior years, we saw lots of price compression. I think the good news is we're not seeing that price compression right now. But we're seeing demand continuously growing and we're seeing all the Tilray different brands growing in the marketplace. And again, what I'm talking about is all our products, it's our flowers, our pre-rolls, our edibles, our vapes, our infused vapes and our drinks.

Sorry, in regards to CC Pharma, listen, I think CC Pharma has been part of Tilray since 2019, and trying to figure out what is the right position is one of our largest business. And we have the European team and with the growth and the opportunities in Germany have realized a couple of things. Number one, they're selling into pharmacies today. We're using the CC Pharma team to sell cannabis also into the pharmacy and also to deliver.

The other thing is here, we're able, from our buying power and get better margins and demand for regular medicines, and we're seeing some great growth. It's the biggest quarter we've ever had with CC Pharma and some of the most profitable quarters we've ever had. So we're looking at how we really take this business for online. We're looking at how we're going to expand this business and take this model into other countries. And again, it's how we utilize the sales organization of CC Pharma or now named Tilray Pharma and using that organization to sell more and more cannabis into the drugstores that it sells into.

Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Grey with Alliance Global Partners.

Aaron Grey
Alliance Global Partners, Research Division

First one for me. You mentioned the expectation for Tilray Global Medical to approach $150 million, I believe. So just any color you could provide maybe on the timing of that expectation. And then you also mentioned some commentary briefly regarding potential regulatory changes in Germany as well as pricing pressure. So could you help to maybe quantify how big a risk you're seeing from each of those potentially for 2026?

Irwin Simon
President, CEO & Chairman

So in regards to -- listen, I think from an annualized basis, right now, we're on a run rate for that $150 million, and that is both Canada and international markets, okay? And the majority of that is coming from international markets.

In regards to regulatory change, I'm not seeing and not concerned with regulatory changes in Europe and Germany. And I think if anything, we like what has ultimately come out of the German government. And in regards to demand, we see more and more demand. As far as price compression, and you heard what I said before. And this is where Canada better watch out. When you look at a lot of the Canadian LPs, there's a lot more the Canadian LPs, there's Israeli companies. There's a lot more companies selling product today into Germany. But Tilray has been in Germany since 2019, 2020 with Tilray Medical. We are the only one or one of the only ones with a grow facility there. And we work very, very closely with the doctors in Germany. You heard what I said before about having Tilray Pharma, where we are vertically integrated from our grow with our salespeople and have our own distribution piece there.

So yes, a lot of product coming into Germany, which forces price compression. But what they're going to realize is the quality of product, you get what you pay for. And I think that's what important is they recognize that the Tilray Medical products stand for quality.

Aaron Grey
Alliance Global Partners, Research Division

I appreciate that. Second question for me, just turning back to the Canadian market, we had some commentary. More broadly, I just wanted -- to give some color in terms of what are your expectations for growth within the Canadian market? Looks like we finished about mid-single-digit growth for 2025. So what's your expectation now for 2026? You talked about some of the strong volumes there. But it does seem like volume growth has tempered a bit despite pricing pressure stabilizing for the Canadian market. So I wanted to hear more about your expectations for growth in the Canadian market and if a slowdown in growth also led to your decision to shift some of that product international?

Irwin Simon
President, CEO & Chairman

Well, first of all, this slowdown of growth. I had a 6% growth, and I had the highest quarter ever in selling units, okay? I think one of the things we're looking -- continuously looking at is how we grow this to more and more profitable business, and we can sell tons of wholesale product, that's considered growth, but we're not going to do that. But what we're looking continuously at is how we're coming out with added value products and premium products.

And today, we have a 50% share on our drinks, which continuously is growing and the demand in that marketplace. We also have the highest share of flower in the marketplace. We sell over 80 million pre-rolls. We sort of backed away from the vape category because of the margins and we're not making money on it. So I see the categories from us, if I get mid- to high single-digit growth, I'll be very, very happy in the Canadian market.

Now with that, I got to tell you, Blair is on the phone, and he can jump in here any time. I have seen some of the best lineup of new products coming out that this company has ever had. And I think that's going to help, new products are key.

The other thing is, listen, the quarter and that -- British Colombia had a strike and I think if other Canadian LPs decide they want to sell product in Europe is just going to be supply. Tilray today has close to 7 million square feet of grow in Canada and has the ability to grow 270 metric tons. I think the number in the quarter as we grew close to 200 metric tons. So we have plenty of supply. And not only that is we have supply an ample product available to ship internationally which is -- we're not paying excise tax and much higher margins for us. So the opportunities are there for us.

Canada is a small country, but it's a country where cannabis is legal from a recreational -- from a federal standpoint, is the only country in the world. And there's more and more users are seeing the benefit of buying cannabis by going into federally legal cannabis stores.

Our next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic with Zuanic & Associates.

Pablo Zuanic
Zuanic & Associates

Look, let me start with CC Pharma. Maybe you can give more color on that business. I think in the past, you said that you reached 13,000 pharmacies. Now you're talking about tripling your distribution reach. I'm trying to understand that better. And also, if the new regulations in Germany, top delivery your CC Pharma reach could be a big asset in terms of pharmacy reach? Would you be willing to also sell other people's products besides Tilray Brands through CC Pharma?

Irwin Simon
President, CEO & Chairman

So number one, as I said, we've owned CC Pharma for -- since 2019, Pablo, and it was finding the right way to operate this business. And originally, we acquired it as part of tenders for Germany. And we've been a part of the German drugstore business in Germany since then. We have now changed a lot within CC Pharma where we've ultimately modernized, we've put money into technology there. We've taken labor costs out of there. We've been able to buy medicines and -- regular medicines from some of the pharmaceutical companies at much better prices and made some big investments. And I'll tell you, that is a big -- is where they're buying medicines and making sure we're buying them at the right price and selling them at less higher margins.

So we have focused on that business. But back to your point, is today, we have the ability to win to more and more pharmacies. The CC Pharma or Tilray Pharma has its own sales organization. And you don't see today cannabis -- medical cannabis sales go through CC Pharma, it goes through our medical cannabis business internationally. So there is a big focus to use that sales organization to sell more and more cannabis -- medical cannabis in Germany. And with that, with the regulations and everybody has to go direct to a pharmacy, it can't buy online, there's bigger opportunities for us because more patients have to visit the pharmacy.

The second question is would I sell other company's product? Great question. We're in the business to sell and make profit. But again, why would we want to sell someone else's products that we can deliver what the needs are for patients. But again, some patients may want some other competitors' products, and it's something we should look at from a standpoint, does it make sense for us to carry some other products, I don't know. And that's not something we've looked at, but it's something we definitely should look at.

Pablo Zuanic
Zuanic & Associates

Okay. And then just a follow-up in terms of beverages. Obviously, this quarter, you had very strong performance in cannabis but a steep decline in sales in beer and profit margins. Maybe just give more color in terms of what is it that has not worked there? You talked about positive momentum, but the numbers don't show that momentum and why put so much hope on just the spring resets? I mean is it just about that? I mean more color would help. And then just long term, a reminder about your confidence that the beer business really fits your cannabis strategy longer term or they just play together, and we should think of them as a diversified portfolio anyway.

Irwin Simon
President, CEO & Chairman

So number one, there's many, many companies out there that have diversified business portfolios. And if you look at most companies, some have food, some have personal care, some have beverages. You look at Pepsi, they have snacks, they have food, they have drinks. If you look at other companies, they have personal care, they have food. So I think it's important to be a diversified consumer packaged goods company, which we are, and we're Tilray Brands. I come back and look at -- we got in the beer business in late 2020, COVID came along where our first acquisition of SweetWater and then multiple acquisitions. It's taken us time to integrate these businesses. We went from only 1 plant to 10 plants now we're down to 8. We went from only 1 brand to 18 brands.

We went from probably being the 10th or 11th largest craft brewer now down to the fourth largest craft brewer. So there's a lot that's happened over the last 4 to 5 years. And with that, there's been a lot of integrations. And these brands that we bought from ABI and from Molsons, they were not some of the best-performing brands at the time, and it took some time to turn them around. So yes, I have a lot of confidence.

Listen, beer is not going away. Beverages is not going away. And just like CC Pharma, here we are from a vertically integrated business, we have manufacturing, we have brands, we have a distribution. We have an infrastructure, salespeople. And it is taking probably some more time. And the other thing is at the same time, the industry has had its decline. But I'll tell you what, as you come back and see a lot potentially will happen in regards to Delta-9 and hemp infused drinks, and who are they looking at to be the leader in that, is Tilray because of our beverage business and our cannabis business.

I say this, and I'm not making projections, but if I could sell cannabis infused drinks, in the U.S. tomorrow. If I look what I have a 50% share in Canada, and I multiply that from a 10x what I would have here it's $0.5 billion business for us here. And someday, we're going to be able to sell drinks in the U.S. infused with something and whether it's CBD and cannabis, in regards to President Trump new rescheduling, in regards to drinks that will get approved by the FDA for -- whether it's for anxiety, for pain, for sleep et cetera.

So the infrastructure is there for future opportunities, which is important. But to the point, we're in the beverage business today. We're in the beer business. We're in the energy drink business. We're in the water business, we're in vodka seltzers business. And I'll tell you what. The other thing is this here, there's a lot of companies talking to us involved -- to get us involved with different aspects of beverages because of what we have and how we're vertically integrated.

So yes, am I totally doing the dance with our results today, coming out of there? No. But do I feel good about what we will do with this business? And what we'll do with these brands? Absolutely, and what our strategy is. Unfortunately, it just is taking a little more time. And if you go back and look at the big companies, Molsons, ABI, Constellation Brands. They weren't created within 5 years. And it's basically 5 years and we're #4 within the craft beer business. A lot of brands have gone away in the craft beer business which gives more and more opportunities. So I am really bullish on the beverage business.

And if you look at the supermarkets today and you look elsewhere, Beverage is the biggest category out there. And I think, Pablo, the big thing, we are not just depending upon the resets that are happening in the next 2 months, gaining share in C-stores, gaining share on premise, gaining share in general. And that's what I'm excited about.

Pablo Zuanic
Zuanic & Associates

That's great color. Look, if I may, I want to squeeze one more if you don't mind. In your -- and just a short answer. In your press release, you talk about U.S. federally rescheduling cannabis. But I think my understanding and most people's understanding would be that if they reschedule, it will still be a state-by-state program. It will not be federally rescheduled. But I guess your interpretation that it will be federally rescheduled. And I think that's a big distinction. Do you want to just share some color on that, but just briefly?

Irwin Simon
President, CEO & Chairman

Our plan is what I've said, if a reschedule -- what we're focused on, and I think a lot of other companies are focused on recreation, we are focused on medical cannabis. And our plan is to leverage the infrastructure and expertise and know-how that we've developed that we got a $150 million business in Tilray today. And with that, our $300 million distribution platform is something that we utilize in Europe and how do we ultimately do that here.

And again, engage with the outreach of the government, with the FDA and with our -- working with hospitals, working with research, doing clinical studies. And that's what we're looking to do there in regards to our U.S. entry into Tilray U.S. not looking at it today of how we do state-by-state from a recreational standpoint. And ultimately, what are we going to do. And we have so much research in pain, anxiety, cancer-related drugs, cancer anti-vomiting drugs, PTSD and taking that science and taking those -- and taking our genetics and strains and working with hospitals and potentially strategically aligning with a pharma company to execute that within the U.S. is what we're looking to do.

The last question comes from Frederico Gomes with ATB Capital Markets.

Frederico Yokota Gomes
ATB Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Just the first question, just going back to the rescheduling comment there with potential rescheduling in the U.S. I'm just curious, does that change the way you see potential investments in the state legal cannabis businesses like you've done in the past with MedMen.

Irwin Simon
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. It doesn't anything with the state. But again, as I said, Tilray is committed to invest in research. Tilray is committed to invest in clinicals, Tilray is committed to working with the FDA, DEA, is coming up with approved cannabis drugs that can be used and sold for some of the conditions that I mentioned before. But it's not state-by-state where we're looking at recreational. We are totally looking at this from a total medical standpoint.

Frederico Yokota Gomes
ATB Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then second question, international cannabis. Could you help us understand outside of Germany, what are the main international markets you have right now? And do you anticipate any other international markets where we could see some sort of regulatory change near term this year that could lead to growth like we saw in Germany since April 2024.

Irwin Simon
President, CEO & Chairman

So listen, whether it's Poland, there's today Italy markets. There's the U.K. markets. We're looking at oils for France and Spain. And I will tell you this here, without going into names, and countries, there's a lot of stuff happening in the Middle East in regards to working with CBD and THC from a Middle East standpoint, there are some stuff and testing going on in India in regards to hemp and hemp infused THC products. So again, and I will say this here, and that's why I thanked President Trump from a rescheduling standpoint.

Rescheduling cannabis from the Schedule I to a Schedule III has opened up the eyes and the legality a lot of other countries here. And I think that's what was important, too. Once the U.S. did it, there's a lot of other companies now are saying this stuff is not taboo. It's something that's really benefit and this can be really helpful in a lot of different diseases, and it can be very helpful as a medicine.

Operator

Thank you. I'd like to pass the call back over to management for any closing remarks.

Irwin Simon
President, CEO & Chairman

Thank you very much, operator, and thank you very much for everybody joining us today. As you can see, there is a lot happening at Tilray. And as a diversified consumer packaged goods company that today sells products into the recreational cannabis market in Canada, sells medical cannabis in Canada, sells drinks in Canada, sells beverages in the U.S. spirits and our hemp-infused -- our hemp foods, our wellness products and then our international products with -- our international medical products and our Tilray Pharma.

So there's a lot within Tilray today, there's a lot of science, there's a lot of research, there's a lot of genetics that we're doing. And as a 5-, 6-year-old company today that's really pulling this all together, and there's no one out there today that is diversified like us. One of our strengths is our balance sheet. It's -- we're in a net cash position. So we're able to invest in research. We're able to invest in trial. We're able to invest in clinicals today.

So you can't look at us today as a recreational cannabis company. You can't look at us as just a beer company. And you've got to look at us today as a consumer company that looks at products and looks at different ways to help bring consumers together, help bring people together. And that is some of the stuff we're doing. At the end of the day, as you can see what we've done this quarter in regards to our profitability for our shareholders. And again, it's been 5 years and putting this together piece by piece, and there's a lot to do.

The question asked by Pablo in regards to our beverage business. Yes, there's a lot to do in the acquisitions that we've done. And one of the proofs is here, look at the acquisitions we've done on cannabis as we put these cannabis facilities and brands together took out costs, integrated the businesses, and we're seeing the performance of that today. It's no different. We've really only got into the international cannabis business over the last year or so, and that's on the run rate to be a $100 million business.

So there's a lot to do within Tilray. There's a lot of great assets within Tilray, whether it's facilities, whether it's brands, whether it's distribution, whether it's know-how. And there's a lot of AI coming into Tilray today to help us implement a lot of what's happening. I appreciate those that have stayed with us as shareholders, I know there's times you're frustrated and there's times probably I'm frustrated more than you are. But I do see a good path with a lot that's happening coming together. I got to tell you, we deal with a tough regulatory environment out there. We pay some of the highest excise tax in Canada and I hope Prime Minister Carney heard me how important this industry is for the Canadian market, the jobs that created the tax dollars, and we don't want to see this run away from Canada.

I commend President Trump for rescheduling. He was the first President that really took this on. Everybody else sort of ran away from it. And it's up to us now to show what this really can do. So thank you very much for getting on our call today, and happy New Year to everybody.
