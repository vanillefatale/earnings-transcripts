[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.


Matthew Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats on a really great print. So, Jim, could you help break down the inflection in same-store sales or the 500 basis point sequential acceleration that you saw? How much would you attribute to company-specific initiatives as we think about marketing or the early stages of store experience relative to the macro backdrop? And could you just elaborate on the strong momentum that you cited in November that supported the fourth quarter raise?


James Conroy
CEO & Director

Sure. It was a really nice sequential improvement. And I think in the prepared remarks, we used the word broad-based. So the merchandise categories every single merchandise category in the third quarter, every single major merchandise category anyway was positive or nicely positive. We had some businesses in the second quarter that were somewhat underperforming, and they've really caught up. And we've seen some really great improvement in most categories across the business.

We also had broad-based strength across the country in terms of our geographic regions, including regions that you would otherwise think would be under pressure. So broad-based strength across the business. How much of it is internal versus external? It's hard to say. We acknowledge that there probably has been some tailwinds out there. Some people are calling out that weather may have been a help. Last year, we called out that weather was a hindrance to our business a little bit. But then in terms of headwinds, there's a whole bunch of other macro uncertainties that have probably left consumers a little bit uneasy in their shopping.

So I give a lot of credit to the team. The product team leads the charge. The assortments look fantastic. They've navigated through tariffs and very strategically have maneuvered AURs. The marketing team has done a very nice job. The stores team has stepped up really the whole company. So it's -- I'm sure there might be something in the macro backdrop that's a tailwind to us, but I also give some credit to the team for just executing extremely well.

And the next question comes from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies.


Corey Tarlowe
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Congrats on the strong results. Jim, I just wanted to hone in on this element of change. And you've come into the business, and we were comping flat to start the year, and we've really substantially accelerated. And I wanted to get a flavor for what, in your view, are the major drivers of this improvement in the momentum? And then what do you think is perhaps the stickiest of all of these changes that is going to propel the business on a multiyear trajectory for continued growth and improvement in outperformance?


James Conroy
CEO & Director

Sure. Happy to have a shot at that. First, I'd start with, I absolutely inherited a strong company that was being managed extremely well. So the company has been growing for years before I showed up. The first quarter was a bit of an anomaly, right? We had a lot of macro headwinds that pushed the business to a flat after a challenging latter part of January and a very challenging February, which we called out last year.

In terms of some of the things that have changed, it's not very different than my remarks on some of the first couple of investor calls. The merchandising team is extremely sophisticated and some of the best merchants in the world work for Ross, and that strength continues to propel the business forward.

If I added anything to the business is to sort of raise or amplify the voices of the marketing group and the stores team, so we can drive more traffic from a marketing standpoint. And when they get to the stores, they can enjoy a slightly better or hopefully much better in-store shopping environment. And the overarching strategy is quite simple, which is just to get merchandising, marketing and stores, perhaps add supply chain to that mix, operating in unison. So we're all kind of pushing the business forward for more growth.


Corey Tarlowe
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Understood. And then just as a follow-up, the new marketing campaigns have clearly resonated. What is it in your view that you think has materially helped to accelerate the amplification of all of these improvements that you've made in the business, particularly from a branded perspective, that's really working from a marketing standpoint and that's helping to amplify the message even more and resonate with consumers.


James Conroy
CEO & Director

Sure, sure. Coming in as an outsider, there are some disadvantages. I wasn't an off-price person, and I'm not a true merchant. But perhaps if there was one advantage, it was a set of fresh eyes. So, from a marketing standpoint, we absolutely want to remain rooted in great branded values. But the challenge that I gave to the marketing team and to the new agency was how do we create cut-through in a -- with a refreshed marketing message. So we've really contemporized how we go to market in terms of a creative standpoint. We've tweaked the merchandise mix a bit. Notably, we haven't increased marketing expense, at least as a percentage of sales. But I think sort of this refreshed view of how you can look at the store and reach out to customers in a slightly different way and perhaps reach out to younger customers in a more aggressive way.

It seems to be taking root. We are encouraged by it. We're excited by it. We've seen some hard metrics improve, and we've seen some qualitative factors improve nicely. And I certainly don't want to dampen anybody's enthusiasm because it's fantastic to see. But let's just remember that it's only been a few months now, right? We've got a very busy holiday season to get through. And then we'll see why it becomes sticky in your mind.

Coming back to that part of your question, I think probably the stickiest thing ultimately will be the power of the Ross brand and just what that means for customers and the promise that it delivers to shoppers. And it's had a great legacy up to this point. And if I had any impact on it, it's how can we modernize it slightly, so we continue to resonate with all customers, particularly younger customers.

And the next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird.


Mark Altschwager
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

You're expecting tariff costs now to be negligible in Q4, which is great to hear. I was hoping you could update us on the mitigation efforts. What's working, what's giving you the comfort with your ability to fully offset? And with that, hoping you could speak specifically to the AUR trend you're seeing and also how we should interpret that Q4 guide as we think about the wraparound effects of tariffs for early 2026.


Michael Hartshorn
Group President, COO & Director

Mark, it's Michael Hartshorn. Similar to what happened in the second quarter, as you saw in our commentary, the tariff-related costs came in lower than we expected. And our merchant teams have done a tremendous job balancing cost concessions with modest market-driven price increases where we can maintain our value gap against other retailers. In addition, they were able to take advantage, given the closeout availability, take advantage of closeouts in the marketplace and chase above-plan sales.

As we expected, as we imagine the year when we had additional lead time from the initial tariff announcements and had open to buy to fill, our merchant teams have been able to mitigate the impact of tariffs, tariffs as we progress through the year. In addition, with some tariff stability, we've been able to normalize ticketing activities in our distribution centers.

For going forward, it's too early to speak for 2026, but barring any meaningful changes in the tariff policy, we would expect pricing stability, which would eliminate the need for our merchants to make pricing decisions against a moving target.


Mark Altschwager
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

And then a quick follow-up on the comp acceleration. I believe you said consistency or you said strength across regions, but I'm wondering if there's any call out by demographic or income cohort.


Michael Hartshorn
Group President, COO & Director

Sure. And just to follow up on your question on AUR. So the comp components for the quarter, traffic, UPT and AUR all increased and transactions were the biggest of those. In terms of demographic performance, we called out in previous quarter our Hispanic stores during the quarter at both Ross and dd's stores that have what I'd say is high trade area Hispanic population saw an improvement that was similar to the chain from quarter-to-quarter and ended up posting solid comps despite trailing the chain slightly.

Other callouts, we did mention in the call, Southeast and the Midwest were our top-performing markets. In terms of bigger markets, California, Florida and Texas were all relatively in line with the chain.

And the next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.


Charles Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

On the marketing change, can we double-click on that a little bit? And do you think you're driving new or lapsed customers? Do you think you're increasing engagement with existing customers? Where do you still see opportunity on that front?


James Conroy
CEO & Director

It's hard to tease out the components of the traffic. We do believe we're gaining some new customers and reengaging with lapsed customers. If you go through the analytics provided by Meta platform and you go through TikTok, I think it's safe to say we have improved our engagement. In terms of where we are in terms of our evolution from a marketing and branding standpoint, it's very, very early, right? We hired an agency in the beginning of the year. Their first output was in the July time frame. We've just released a couple of new spots for holiday that then translate across all the digital platforms as well. So very early innings. And Deepa and the marketing team have done an unbelievable job. But there's just even more in front of us, I think, for us to continue to learn and react to that and continue to deliver some great messaging.


Charles Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

That's great. And just as a follow-up, you noted that as a percentage of sales, you didn't increase the spend, but it's well known that you spend far less in dollars and as a percentage of sales relative to your largest peer. When you look ahead, do you think you need to grow that? Or do you think you continue to just reinvest and redeploy those dollars?


James Conroy
CEO & Director

It's a good question. Right now, we're going to maintain our percent of sales where it is. We have a financial and operating model that I want to kind of work within. Clearly, if we can spur on more business and drive more customers and drive more sales even at the same rate, we'll get some more marketing dollars. So it's too early to say we'll invest any more in it. And right now, the amount we're spending seems to be paying dividends. So stay tuned for that. But there's no immediate plans for an increased spend there.


Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.


Lorraine Maikis
BofA Securities, Research Division

Jim, you called out the branded strategy as a key driver of the comp acceleration. Can you talk about how this benefit has built over time and how much more opportunity you see going forward?


James Conroy
CEO & Director

Sure. Absolutely. And if you want to go through the time line, in the fourth quarter last year, we had a decent quarter, and we called out the branded strategy touches everything, but it's probably most impactful to ladies. So if we just look at the ladies business and how it's sequentially changed over the last few quarters, last year, fourth quarter was pretty strong, but ladies was a drag on the comp. Then in Q1 and in Q2, the ladies business was slightly better, but still flattish and a slight drag on the comp in Q1. in Q2, it started to show some improvement. It was kind of in line with the company, maybe slightly comp enhancing. And in this most recent quarter, the entire business got better, substantially better. And the ladies business was actually comp enhancing. So if we posted a plus 7%, you can intuit that the ladies business was better than a plus 7%.


Lorraine Maikis
BofA Securities, Research Division

And how much more opportunity do you see -- yes, how much more opportunity going forward do you see in this ladies business from the branded strategy?


James Conroy
CEO & Director

A fair amount, I think. I mean we -- as you know, we've been investing in that over four or five quarters. It had a drag on our merchandise margin that we thought would be an investment in the business. And that investment seems to be paying off now.

I think with very solid quarter under our belt, I'd like to think that for the next three quarters until we at least anniversary that, we'll see some outsized growth. And then, of course, that team has really started to build excitement, some great leadership there. And I think after -- even after we anniversary this quarter, I think they'll find some opportunities for more comp improvement. There's not a lack of ideas for innovation in that part of the business.


Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citibank.


Paul Lejuez
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Jim, sorry if I missed it. Did you say anything about the monthly cadence? Curious if you could share anything on that front, home versus apparel and specifically, not just performance, home versus apparel, but AURs in each of those categories? And then is there any quantification of how your customer base has changed? Like within that ladies business, can you isolate that you are getting a customer of a certain age that you did not previously have? Is there any quantification to that?


Michael Hartshorn
Group President, COO & Director

I'll just start on a couple of those, Paul. During the quarter, we had a very strong back-to-school and held the trend throughout the quarter. So throughout the trends were fairly consistent, and that was true for both Ross and dd's.

On the AUR, I said in a previous commentary that it was driven by increases in traffic, UPT and AUR with the traffic or transactions for us, the biggest of those. Traffic and the basket were very similar.

In terms of overall category performance, we mentioned children's and men's were relatively in line with the chain. cosmetics, shoes and ladies were best performers. Home was slightly below the chain average.

You also asked about shifts in business. The things we measure against usually, you see bigger trends over time. We certainly talked about demographics and the Hispanic customer. In terms of household income, the -- not only were the sales very broad-based across geographies and merchandise categories, they're also very broad-based across trade area income levels, and we did not see any significant shifts there.


Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley.


Alexandra Straton
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Congrats on a great quarter. Maybe just on -- maybe for you, Jim, on the upgrading the store experience. I think you highlighted that as an opportunity when you first started. Did any changes there play a role in the comp acceleration? And maybe how do you gauge effectiveness of those strategies? And what are your priorities on that front as you think about 4Q and into next year?


Michael Hartshorn
Group President, COO & Director

I can take that. We're addressing the store experience on a couple of different factors. First, we have begun refreshing -- we expect to refresh all stores in the chain, which we believe will provide a more modern look and feel for the customer. This includes new perimeter signing, wayfinding signage along with addressing cosmetic type repairs. We're halfway through the chain there. And though it's very early, the customer feedback has been good.

The other focus areas within the store is, you can imagine, improving line lengths and throughput through the front end of the store and also improving our recovery throughout the day. And we're finding places to get efficiencies within the store and then reinvest it in those focus areas. In terms of immediate impact in the quarter, I think it's very early days. And if anything, we'd expect to build momentum over time.


Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs.


Brooke Roach
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Jim, I wanted to get your thoughts on Ross's approach to value gaps into holiday and 2026 as market prices move up. How much of the AUR growth in the third quarter was driven by price actions versus mix? And are there any categories where you've taken action on pricing where you're starting to see any signs of consumer elasticity?


James Conroy
CEO & Director

Sure. Happy to take it. In terms of the first part of your question, our strategy is, I think, a pretty typical off-price strategy of keeping an umbrella under traditional retailers in terms of pricing. we tend to be very intensely focused on the values that we provide, which is one of the reasons why we were a little bit slower to make any changes to AUR because we really wanted to underscore the customer that we were going to be delivering values, including during a tariff environment. And holding true to that, and we've called out tariff impacts in the last couple of quarters, although they're going away for the fourth quarter, but holding true to that sort of promise perhaps has helped us pull in some new customers or bring back lapsed customers. So we're excited about that.

I think Michael talked about in terms of transactions, AUR and UPT transactions was still the biggest driver of the comp. As we look at the fourth quarter, we have been pretty much bought up for the fourth quarter for a while. So I wouldn't expect any significant changes in our strategy from a pricing standpoint for the fourth quarter. I think it was encouraging that we were able to have a modest increase in our AUR and not see degradation in units per transaction. That was up a little bit and also continue to see transactions. So hopefully, that's answered the question.

I mean it's been a very difficult thing to navigate for the last several months looking at the changing in tariffs and the changes in the retail environment and trying to find exactly the right set of prices for every single category. Have we made mistakes within that? Probably. And it's -- what ultimately falls out of that is a business that is -- may start turning slightly slower, so you may mark it down and then you move through it. But on balance, we haven't had any significant footfalls that have created massively increased markdowns or slowdown in our terms.


Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Evercore ISI.


Michael Binetti
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Congrats on a nice quarter. Jim, I guess as you look at marketing and some of the store refreshes and the state of the fleet today, as you look at some of the initial successes and the top line impact here, how do you think about what to invest in and accelerate those things that are working to keep the top line going versus how you think about flowing through some of the earnings on these initiatives to investors next year? I think just at the highest level, maybe some thinking on the trade-offs between pushing sales harder now you've got some things that are very obviously working and then flow-through versus investment next year.

And then separately, you've spoken a little bit about a strong pipeline of dd's stores in the past. How are the Ross banner stores in the Northeast area doing? And do you see an opportunity to accelerate store growth at both chains at Ross in addition to dd's?


James Conroy
CEO & Director

Sure. Maybe I'll take the first one, and Mike will take the second piece of that in terms of store growth.

On the invest versus flow-through, yes, I'm not even here a year, and I was very cautious when I first got here to "listen, learn and lead", right? I really wanted to learn a new business, a much bigger business and the off-price sector, et cetera. And while I had some hypotheses for change as did the team, we -- I really wanted to be respectful of the financial model and the operating model that has been successful for the company for so long. So while we've made some changes over the last couple of quarters and perhaps we're seeing fruits of that -- of those changes now, I'd like to let some more time go before we come out and say, we're going to overinvest betting on the come for future results.

So anything we've done so far has been, again, within the expense structure, within the financial model the company has, and we haven't spent anything in an outsized way from a marketing perspective or really from a stores perspective outside of the sort of the capital plan that was here when I got here.

Three months from now, six months from now, if we continue to see positive ROI, to your point, we may then get more aggressive and say, look, if we can break the model slightly from a financial standpoint, will we deliver higher comps and additional earnings? Perhaps. But right now, I think we're all kind of committed to the operating model that's worked for the company for decades.


Michael Hartshorn
Group President, COO & Director

Michael, on real estate, first on this year's store openings. As we said in the commentary, we opened 80 Ross and 10 dd's. As an entire group, the new stores have outperformed our plan, and we're very excited, although it's very early with the success in both the Northeast and the New York stores and also in our Puerto Rico stores that opened over the summer.

So, as I said, what we've seen thus far, we're really optimistic about the Northeast expansion. We feel good about the real estate landscape. We have a very healthy pipeline. We've said before that we're going to reaccelerate the dd's growth. In terms of the combined groups, we'll have more to say when we get to the end of the year in our 2026 guidance.


Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.


Irwin Boruchow
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Jim, I figured I would ask about self-checkout. I think it's something you've talked about in the past as a driver. Where -- how many stores is that rolled out to? How meaningful can that be maybe over the next 12 months? And just kind of how are you thinking about ROI on that investment?


Michael Hartshorn
Group President, COO & Director

Sure, Ike. It's in 80 stores today, and it's taken us a while to get to this point. We tried a couple of different models, and it's taken us a while to get the shrink aspect of self-checkout correct. We now have a prototype that's worked well for us over the last year, and we're not only seeing lower shrink, but we're seeing higher -- high customer adoption.

We're seeing sales impacts in the stores that we put it in, and we'll be rolling it out to further stores next year. How big, it will be depends on kind of the next phase of rollout, but where it works best for us is in our high-volume stores. So we'll continue to roll it out. We'll have more to say on how many of those stores in the '26 preview.


Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays.


Adrienne Yih-Tennant
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Congratulations on the great acceleration into holiday. First question on dd's. Did you see any -- I mean, was it pattern very similarly to the Ross Dress for Less stores? Or did you see any pressure, particularly in the early part of November with the delay of the SNAP benefit. So has that rebounded?

And then secondly, you mentioned that the results fully offset all of the tariff, the gross tariff amount. So should we assume that, that obviously is the case for the fourth quarter, but that kind of the biggest impact because of your turns being so fast, that the biggest impact would have been felt in 2025 and we enter '26 in a pretty normal way state in terms of tariffs or there's probably a little bit of overhang in Q1?


Michael Hartshorn
Group President, COO & Director

Adrienne, on the dd's, dd's was very similar to Ross. The business was very consistent across the quarter. So there's nothing that I would call out there.

In terms of tariffs, we did say there continued to be an impact in Q3, but it will be neutral in Q4 as we've been able to chase the business with closeouts, we've been able to work with vendors on cost concessions. And I would expect it to be somewhat neutral. It is neutral in Q4 and expect it to be neutral as we move into '26.


Adrienne Yih-Tennant
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And then my quick follow-up is just going to be, there are very few companies that are exiting the third quarter with overall sales growing faster than inventory on an average basis or even at the end of the quarter. Obviously, you've built some inventory up. The availability is fantastic. Is this just sort of do you feel -- I'm going to ask a question because I know the answer to. I mean, clearly, you can chase that inventory.

But I guess as you think about kind of like heading into spring, what are you seeing in terms of kind of being a little bit more maybe disciplined or judicious about taking some of that packaway? Any changes to strategy as we head into spring when we think that broader retail will raise prices across the board?


Michael Hartshorn
Group President, COO & Director

On the ending inventory, as we said in the commentary, we did end up 15% on the last day of the quarter. Actually, during the quarter, inventory was in line with sales, which similar to prior years, holiday shopping and promotions are well underway ahead of Thanksgiving holiday and in anticipation of those shifts, we set the sales floor for the holiday as we -- at the end of October, which is earlier than last year and also advanced some of the inventory into the store.


Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with the Telsey Advisory Group.


Dana Telsey
Telsey Advisory Group LLC

Congratulations on the terrific results. As you take a look at your customer, particularly an assessment of the lower income customers, are you seeing anything -- are you seeing a trade down to the core Ross? What are you seeing in dd's?

And is there any difference in performance of the lower income stores in lower income areas versus others?

And then just lastly, with the expansion into the New York area or the Northeast, as you think about your store expansion plans for next year, will a greater portion of those stores be in the Northeast? And how do you see opening costs? And is there -- is the opportunity for greater sales from those stores in more dense areas, leveraging the cost given it may be a higher cost structure?


Michael Hartshorn
Group President, COO & Director

Dana, on the trade-down customer, it's really hard to peel apart in the data. We do measure the trade area demographics around the stores and the 7% comp was very broad-based across all income levels. So we didn't see any distinction between the lower, higher income customers.

In terms of entry into the Northeast, today, about 70% of our store openings are in what I call existing markets and 30% in newer markets, which would now include the Northeast and Puerto Rico over the last couple of years, it's included the upper Midwest. I'd expect that pace to continue, and we'll gradually continue to add in New York over time into Puerto Rico and continue to expand those markets.

We don't think our return on opening a new store will decline as we enter the Northeast. As you say, it's more dense population should drive higher sales to support the additional investment and higher cost in some of the store base there.


Dana Telsey
Telsey Advisory Group LLC

Got it. And then just one more thing, Jim, in terms of what you're seeing with the store refreshes, the brand enhancements that you're making in brand in general, other categories besides women's where you're seeing this opportunity for? And when you think about the store refreshes, anything that is particularly notable that you see as the opportunity for next year?


James Conroy
CEO & Director

Well, we certainly have some ideas about next year, and we don't want to sort of necessarily divulge those just yet. In terms of categories that have improved, we've seen sequential improvement across a number of different businesses. Perhaps the one to call out is the home business was a drag in Q2 and was nicely positive in Q3. And we feel well positioned in that piece of the business as we go into the fourth quarter when it spikes as a percent of sales.

So I think that's maybe another category that we can talk about some of the wins that merchandise team has pulled together. And yes, I'm glad to hear the enthusiasm on store refreshes and the stores, I think, are looking a bit better. I would come back to some of my earlier comments that it's still very early innings in some of these changes. So maybe that just is good news in terms of the best is yet to come.


Operator

And the next question comes from the line of John Kernan with TD Cowen.


John Kernan
TD Cowen, Research Division

All right. Congrats on the great quarter, guys. Just wanted to circle back to gross margin. The merch margin was down slightly. You're now lapping a lot of the initiatives in the branded segment. I'm just curious what you think the opportunities for merch margin are going forward. You are comfortably above the levels you were at pre-COVID as a benchmark. I'm just curious what you see as long-term drivers. And I just have a quick follow-up on distribution costs.


William Sheehan
Executive VP & CFO

I mean, like you said, merch margin although it declined, it was a little better than we expected as we had less ticketing and some stronger shrink results helped there. Moving forward, it's an area of continued focus. And certainly, we would like it to get better. But I think currently, we'd expect it to be relatively stable over time.


Michael Hartshorn
Group President, COO & Director

I think there is -- we talked about we're 1.5 years into the brand strategy. I think there's going to continue to be opportunity to gain some leverage as we move through time as we've built the branded relationships with the vendors, gives us opportunity for closeouts. So I think there's still some opportunity there.

Within gross margin, the transportation cost will be a year-to-year kind of market-based discussion. But I think there's ongoing improvement capture in merchandise margins.


John Kernan
TD Cowen, Research Division

Obviously, the new DC seems to give you a lot of capacity. Just curious on distribution deleverage. Is that something that continues into next year? It looks like it picked up in Q2 this year, and I'm assuming it continues a little bit in the fourth quarter.


William Sheehan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. In Q3, that deleverage, like we've talked about a bit before, the full impact of the opening of a new distribution center and also some tariff-related processing costs. As we move forward, we'd expect that pressure from the new DC continued, but that pre-ticketing pressure we've seen before related to tariffs should improve a bit. So we'd expect just a slight headwind in Q4.


Michael Hartshorn
Group President, COO & Director

And as we grow capacity, we look beyond this year, we'll be able to continue to lever that new capacity until we open our next distribution center, which is two to three days away.


Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Aneesha Sherman with Bernstein.


Aneesha Sherman
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

I want to follow up on the brand strategy. As you've discussed it in the past, you've talked about not changing the good, better, best mix, but rather increasing the availability of branded goods versus unbranded and label. As you're now attracting new customers and growing AUR and basket size, are you rethinking that and potentially considering adding more higher-end brands to expand the mix on the higher side?

And then a follow-up on Home. Jim, you talked about Home getting better this quarter, though it was still weaker than the chain for two quarters in a row. Have you pulled back on the assortment at all in response to that weakness? And are there any implications there in terms of holiday and gifting and home decor assortment going into the holiday period?


James Conroy
CEO & Director

Of course. On the Home piece, absolutely not. We feel that the Home business is really building momentum and the team there has just created tremendous sequential improvement. As we get into the fourth quarter, the categories change a bit, right? We -- toys increases quite a bit, food increases, et cetera. So those businesses kind of have nothing to do with the incoming trend line, and we feel extremely well positioned from a gifting standpoint and from a toy standpoint.

In terms of branded versus unbranded, a couple of points, I guess, I would say is we've -- over the last several years, right, the reason the brand strategy was put in place and certainly predated me was there was a notion that the company had migrated away a little bit too much from known brands chasing higher margin or higher markup kind of tertiary players, and we needed to right that ship. That doesn't always mean higher-end brands, though, right? There are some really great brands at all price points within the store -- and we have a very diverse customer base in every definition of that term. So we want to have the best branded values for a good, better or best pricing tier.

Is there some opportunity to stretch higher? Perhaps. The merchants are always out there looking for the next new brand. It's always a small celebration within the buying office when we've opened a new brand and we've gotten access to new closeouts, et cetera. And over time, perhaps that will be -- that will include reaching up a little bit. But I would say it's across the board.


Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker.


Marni Shapiro
The Retail Tracker

Congratulations on a great quarter and congratulations on the New York store. I hear it is the place to be. I'm just curious on the marketing. It's what I'm hearing. It's what my people say. So I'm so curious on the marketing side as you kind of dive a little bit more into marketing, two things. Will you, at some point, consider a loyalty program? And how -- what would that look like if you thought about it? And are you doing even some of the more basic stuff like e-mail or phone number capture so that you can more directly talk to your consumers?


James Conroy

So I'm not sure about the loyalty program. On the e-mail and text, we do have a pretty decent e-mail database in existence today, a few million active e-mail addresses -- and while we don't constantly update that number to the Street, we saw a really nice increase in active e-mails over the last quarter. So that was great. We don't have an active text program at the moment. But who knows? We're -- the first order of business from a marketing standpoint was to experiment with some slightly different messaging and maybe a slightly more contemporary aesthetic. And over time, we might try some of these other ideas.

Yes, the Brooklyn store has been just great addition to the portfolio. I'm glad it's the place to be seen. We've seen a lot of interesting people come in recently, and we're constantly kind of spying on it with our CCTV. So we kind of know everybody that goes in and out. But yes.

Yes, yes. No, everybody competitors, everybody. So that store has been a really nice arrow in the quiver. And who knows what it bodes for future stores there. I mean that particular location is pretty unique, very high traffic. There are other stores that we've seen open up in that area in the New York metro area that have had very strong openings, perhaps that would probably be the outlier one, the one in Brooklyn that you're talking about.

We have time for one last question coming from the line of Jay Sole with UBS.


Jay Sole
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Jim, my question is about the guidance because you're guiding to 3% to 4% comp. And if I look back ex the post-COVID period, the company hasn't guided above the 2% to 3% in at least 10 years. I'm just wondering what this signals. I mean, are you taking a different approach to guiding now being CEO? Or is it just that the quarter-to-date trends you're seeing are so good that you just felt like 2% to 3% just wasn't even relevant and you had to guide to 3% to 4%, because sometimes the thought is that the guide as much as internal signals and external signal, sort of a signal to sort of plan conservatively and then just be prepared to chase, keep a lot of open liquidity if opportunities materialize in the quarter.

So just kind of wondering how you're thinking about guiding and why you decided to go to 3% to 4% instead of just sticking to the same old 2% to 3%.


Michael Hartshorn
Group President, COO & Director

Jay, it's Michael Hartshorn. It's probably less tricky than you think. It is our internal plan. So currently coming off a 7% comp, that's how the underlying business is planned. And we always try to align the internal latest forecast with the plan. So there's no change in methodology. It is really how we're planning the business for the fourth quarter based on the momentum in Q3.

There are no further questions at this time. And I would like to turn the floor back over to Jim Conroy for closing remarks.


James Conroy
CEO & Director

Very good. Well, thank you, everybody, for your interest in Ross Stores. We wish you all a very happy holiday season. Take care.


Operator

And thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.
