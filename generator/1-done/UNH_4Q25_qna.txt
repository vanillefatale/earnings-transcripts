[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.

Joshua Raskin
Nephron Research LLC

I appreciate all the details. So you're guiding to a decline in 2026 in traditional MA lives of almost mid-teens and the proposed rates for 2027, as Tim mentioned, might indicate the need to further refine benefits even more than that. So do you think we're at the bottom of the MA cycle now? Should we expect MA margins to improve, not just what you mentioned in '26 but in 2027? And then if you could help frame how important that core MA book is to the other segments of the enterprise, especially Optum Health?

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

Yes. So Josh, maybe I'll maybe respond to the second half of your question, and then Tim Noel can kind of respond to the first. But our interest has always been to serve all the markets in health care, all the segments and also the national health system as a whole. And MA is certainly important in that sense, and it's important to Optum Health and OptumRx just as you suggest.

But I also might turn it around another way because the Optum businesses are extremely complementary to UnitedHealthcare and its benefits and to many other payers. And that's why we believe that we are bringing, more broadly to the health care market, a very broad value really across the board. And that is why you really -- you have to strike the right balance when you're thinking about this in terms of growth in membership really across the whole of the UnitedHealth Group platform.

Tim?

Timothy Noel
Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Business

Thanks for the question. So let me start the conversation with 2026. And as I hit on in the opening remarks, our strategy in '26 did focus more so on margin than it did on any specific membership target and that is all really playing out as expected. When you think about some of the core and key pricing assumptions that we made as we close out '25, those look to be good assumptions that we made, and they're really holding firm. So we feel good about our margin recovery efforts of about 50 basis points across Medicare Advantage.

The membership losses, while they're a little north of what we were talking about earlier, really kind of sit within our internal planning range. So I think about that all as a real solid foundation that we're setting for 2026 as we then head into 2027.

So moving into 2027, the news that we received last night in the Advance Notice was disappointing. And it was because it's a further reduction for a program that has experienced $130 billion in benefit -- or pardon me, in funding reductions over the last 3 years under the prior administration, which is particularly concerning for a program that provides excellent choice, access and affordability for America's seniors and does so with satisfaction rates north of 95% while saving money for taxpayers.

So we're going to, of course, work with CMS from now until the rates are finalized. But as this all sits today, as I talked about, it will mean very meaningful benefit reductions, and we'll once again need to take a hard look at our geographic footprint, our product footprint across the country and has the likelihood to play out not dissimilar to how 2026 did in terms of modifications to plan footprint and benefits.

We don't see this to be something that's going to be broadly disproportionate payer by payer. Therefore, seniors kind of across the sector are going to experience these implications of reduced choice, reduced access and affordability challenges.

And given all of this and kind of where we sit, too early to talk point estimates around margin or membership for 2027. But I will say this that over the long term, given the actions that we have taken in 2026 and our integrated business model that, as Steve alluded to, really focuses on value-based care, those things, having a strong foundation, focusing on value-based models are going to be even more important in this environment that we're being asked to operate. Thanks for the question, Josh.

Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

I wanted to ask about the fourth quarter Optum Health performance. You guided to just under $3 billion of OI with the third quarter results. And if I'm doing the adjusted math correctly, it came in closer to $2.3 billion. So underperformed by $600 million, $700 million of OI in the fourth quarter. It's fairly surprising to still see this kind of volatility in the business that late in the year.

I was hoping you could lay out the drivers there and talk to what gives you guys confidence in more stable performance in 2026, given that fourth quarter volatility coming out of the year.

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

Good question, Justin. And very much focused on making sure that we really took a hard look at that whole of the Optum Health business. So Krista, do you want to respond?

Krista Nelson
Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Community & State

Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question, Justin. So results in the fourth quarter and for the full year were slightly disappointing to our expectations, but really reflective of the restructuring actions that we took in the fourth quarter as well as some onetime items that are now right behind us.

In addition, in the fourth quarter, Medical remained elevated but consistent with our expectations. So excluding restructuring and the move of Optum Financial, our adjusted earnings are now approximately $1.5 billion, which is our new baseline that we will continue to build off of in the future.

Maybe I'll just take a quick step back and answer the second part of your question, which is, what gives us confidence? We have reoriented Optum Health back towards our original purpose. And we have a full integrated value-based care delivery system where we employ and deeply partner with providers across multiple service lines, including primary and specialty care, imaging, surgery, home health, behavioral health and additional wraparound services to support our patients.

It's a system that's anchored by primary care and an aligned payment model which incentivizes improved outcomes, offering preventive and holistic care compared to a system that rewards volume of services. And we've established this strategic clarity in the business and paired it with a very comprehensive evaluation of our assets and capabilities, which, as a result, we took meaningful actions in the fourth quarter to strengthen our foundation.

And in addition to that, I'm pleased with progress that we've made in reshaping our risk portfolio, refining our network and bolstering operations. And I would say we're significantly stronger today than we were just 6 months ago. Thanks for the question.

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

So a really solid shakeout, a totally different management and leadership team and a much more rigorous approach, a lot of potential there.

Operator

And we'll move to our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.

Kevin Fischbeck
BofA Securities, Research Division

I wanted to go back to the '27 MA rate update. Basically, it sounds like you're saying that trend is the biggest part you want to go back to the government with, but I wanted to focus, I guess, on the 2 kind of coding components that if you take out normalization, 1.8% for, call it, the risk model and another 1.5% for charts. So it's like a 3.3% headwind. I think that with V28, you guys talked about an impact that was more than what the industry was seeing.

Would you expect a similar dynamic with these 2 coding components that as a company is probably better than average of coding, you'd see more than this kind of 3.3% headwind that we're calculating? And do you still feel good about -- if that's true, do you still feel good about getting to a 5% margin in value-based care of Optum Health?

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

Sure. Tim, do you want to address that?

Timothy Noel
Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Business

Yes. Kevin, thanks for the question. So no, we don't expect the impact to be different for us versus the rest of the industry on those 2 elements that you outlined. Our modeling shows consistency between what we're seeing and also what the estimates are of industry averages on those 2 elements.

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

And outlook? So Kevin, was there a second part to your question?

Kevin Fischbeck
BofA Securities, Research Division

Yes. The second part was Optum Health margins with this rate cut [indiscernible] the 5%...

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

Yes. Krista?

Krista Nelson
Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Community & State

Yes. Thanks for that question. I would just say it's early. We have opportunities to improve performance in the business just outside of MA rates. Let me just give you a couple of examples that really give me confidence in why we're really confident in getting back to our long-term target margins. As I've gotten to spend time with our care teams and after we've done that complete thoughtful evaluation of our performance in our businesses, we do have many high-performing markets today that really deliver strong outcomes for our patients.

One example worth highlighting is a large market in Texas, where we serve over 750,000 patients across over 50 clinics offering that holistic care I described: primary care, labs, imaging, specialty care, home health, surgery, care coordination. We're really proud of our results. For example, here, we've got a 4.5-star health plan. We have total cost of care that is approximately 30% better than our competitors, a patient satisfaction of 90, really strong provider retention and margins already performing in our long-term target margin range.

Another example that just gives me confidence here is we've got about 30% of our mature value-based care patients that are already, again, inside that target margin range or above. And so those 2 examples, combined with the work I described previously that we're doing to improve the consistency of our performance, just give me a lot of confidence in the runway ahead for Optum Health.

Kevin Fischbeck
BofA Securities, Research Division

So really more about execution really than any other single factor, really is focused on execution.

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

Yes. Thanks for the question.

Operator

We'll go next to Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.

Stephen Baxter
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

In the Medicaid business, I think you made reference to getting a little bit of rate relief. So I was hoping you could speak to [ 1/1 ] rates that you're seeing and maybe contrast that to the rates you were seeing in 2025. And in general, if the rates are coming in a little bit better and it seems like there's not going to be any material impact from early starts to work requirements, have you kind of revisited your margin assumption for the Medicaid business at all in 2026?

Michael Cotton
Chief Executive Officer of Medicaid

Thanks, Stephen, for the question. I'll give you kind of an overview on where we are in rates. For 2026, our view remains unchanged in terms of overall performance. Our Medicaid business -- for our Medicaid business, we do expect some margin contraction due to the ongoing dislocation of rates and continued elevated medical trends.

We are projecting rate increases in the range of 6% to 7% in aggregate for the year, but that will continue to be below our medical trend. And we do expect some membership contraction as we continue to manage the business. For January 1, our rates are somewhat in line with our expectations. And again, we expect our rates to range between 6% to 7% for the year as we think about 2026. Thanks for the question.

Operator

And our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.

Lisa Gill
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I wanted to ask a couple of questions on the OptumRx side. First, Wayne, you made a comment that due to Part D, we're going to see earnings more first half driven. Can you talk about the changes around the subsidies and the impact that we have on Part D?

And then secondly, when we think about OptumRx, you talked about the member contractions because of what happened on the United side, but 800 new clients on that side. Last quarter, you talked about combining prescription and medical benefit trends. Can you just talk about those 800 new clients? And if there's anything different that you're seeing in them as we think about '26?

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

So maybe the first question, Bobby, and then Jon, the second part.

Bobby Hunter
CEO of Government Programs & Head of Medicare Insurance

Yes. Thanks, Lisa, for the question. So maybe just kind of hit quickly on the Part D side. I mean Wayne did talk about the seasonality dynamic. We've been pretty clear, I think, now with the implementation of the IRA, we do see more of an even kind of seasonal trending throughout the year. So that element is certainly kind of foundational in the outlook.

When you think about the actual 2026 benefit design, the way that we position the benefits on the Part D, both for stand-alone PDP and MAPD, I think it's very reflective of the way that the IRA has evolved the program, the way that the industry has largely kind of evolved the design. So I feel like we're in pretty good lockstep there with where overall industry is moving.

And as I look at just kind of how 2025 closed out on the pharmacy cost for us inside the health plan, I feel pretty good about the overall trend on balance between all the key drivers, things like specialty trend, brand utilization, et cetera. So it gives me a pretty good belief in our outlook and our positioning for 2026. And early in the year, I haven't seen anything to suggest otherwise. Thanks for the question.

Jon Mahrt
Chief Growth Officer

Fantastic, Bobby. And Lisa, thanks for the question. So maybe building on the membership growth, I'll pick up where Patrick left off in some of his opening comments. Strong selling season in 2026 combined with continued high 90s retention allowed us to backfill about half, maybe more than half of the membership loss from UHC. And so that puts us in a nice position to deliver a modest 2% earnings growth in 2026 for a business that we expect will return to the low double digit to high single -- low single digit to high -- excuse me, high single-digit to low double-digit earnings growth.

And if I unpack that, Lisa, to your question on what are we seeing in the market and why are we winning? Why did those 800 new clients choose OptumRx? A couple of points. Our businesses are performing strongly. Each of our core businesses growing in the high single digits. And the reason we're winning threefold: affordability, transparency and execution.

From an affordability perspective, our clients have never needed us more than now and good prospective activity there. We're committed to bringing affordability to those that we serve. For our clients, OptumRx generates more than $100 billion in savings annually through negotiations with drug manufacturers and network pharmacies. And then for our members and patients, we deliver more than $1 billion in savings annually through our Price Edge and Specialty IQ solutions.

From a transparency perspective, frankly, we're proud to be leading the transparency transformation in this industry. And this begins with the industry's only fully transparent pharmacy and therapeutics committee. And then it continues through the supply chain with wholesome instrumentation around manufacturer, network and wholesaler drug pricing. And so we couple all of this with our commitment to pass through 100% of rebates to clients by 2028, and then we wrap that in a transparency guarantee around our offering for our clients.

And then finally, rounding out on experience. We're making it easier for all those that we serve: providers, clients and members to interact with us. In our pharmacies, record high NPS in our home delivery pharmacy, our behavioral health pharmacy delivering 90% NPS for the patients that we serve. And in our hospital-based specialty pharmacies, high 90s NPS for patients and low 90s for providers.

And then finally, Lisa, we're eliminating provider and patient abrasion. So as Patrick mentioned, we reduced or removed reauthorization requirements for more than 180 drugs that had the net effect of reducing our overall prior authorizations by more than 10%. So in summary, transformational vision is compelling, our offering is resonating, our team is executing and we're well positioned for 2026. Thanks for the question.

And our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Goldman Sachs.

Scott Fidel
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I guess I'll flip over to the commercial business. And interested if you could just provide us with the breakdown of the 1.3 million to 1.4 million commercial risk lives that you're expecting to decline in 2026, how that breaks out between commercial group and then the exchanges.

And then also just in terms of margins and year-over-year progression for commercial group and the exchanges, what you're thinking about for '26. Obviously, we know that you're planning to rebate the profits from the exchange business.

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

Thanks, Scott. Dan?

Daniel Schumacher
Chief Strategy & Growth Officer

Yes, Scott, thanks for the question. Addressing your membership first and then moving to margin. On membership, pertaining to the risk-based decline, the largest share of that membership decline is connected to our exchange business for 2026, where we continue to expect meaningful decline between now and the end of the year.

Beyond the exchange business, general market decline of risk-based customers, our pricing posture supporting margin recovery and continued deliberate migration to our self-funded, level-funded small employer offerings, all contributing to a decline in risk-based membership. So to parse that out specifically, 500,000-plus attributable to the exchange business, the remainder to those 3 factors.

Moving to margins and first addressing the exchange business. Over the course of the decade-plus in which we have operated in that market, it has never been a significant contributor of earnings for us. Our pricing posture for 2026 coming out of 2025 is going to return that market to a positive margin business for us. However, I would expect those margins in the exchange business for 2026 to be in about the 1% range, plus or minus 1% for that business.

Related to margin for the group business in 2026, I'm encouraged by our January performance and how that has set us up for our full year plan. Specifically, for January, we found the market to be firm and competitive and that supported us yielding the required renewal rates and membership persistency to deliver on the 2026 margin improvement that Tim alluded to in his opening remarks. Specifically, I expect us to close more than half of the gap between our 2025 margin performance and our historical margin range, which we expect to achieve in 2027. Thanks for the question, Scott.

Operator

We'll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS.

Albert Rice
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I think as you guys came back on board and got your arms around the business, you talked about modest growth in '26, getting back to low double-digit earnings growth in '27 and then something more like what we're used to seeing from United in '28. You're talking about the rate notice impacting benefit design and being felt by seniors. And I think your underlying assumptions generally in Medicare and with Optum Health had been for gradual margin improvement, not dramatic margin improvement over the years.

You've got now a view on all the other business lines. Do you still think you can get to low double-digit growth in '27 and back to traditional growth in '28 as you put it all together?

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

Yes. Well, A.J., thanks for the question. So we're not going to really talk to '27. Obviously, it's January of '26. So -- but I would say that the business is meaningfully stronger than it was just a few months ago. And in '26, our agenda is to strengthen it even further. We'll continue to be focused on doing smart, intelligent things to serve that total mission, but well within the margins that we have operated in and continue to believe we can strengthen that.

So I can't speak to '27, but I will speak, let's say, to a longer term, and that is very much feel that we can operate within our long-term growth rate margins, that 13% to 16%. When you take a look at the needs in the marketplace and the opportunity for this total enterprise to operate at its full potential, and actually, the elements in the marketplace, the actual pressures that have been discussed on this call, actually to respond to those effectively across the marketplace really speaks to what I think our overall business approach can achieve.

And when you think about just solid organic growth and retention, again, in the margins that we have been talking about, the enormous potential of AI-driven productivity, which is already in line with an organization that is driven towards productivity and scale, innovation and approaches to kind of serve the broader health care marketplace, kind of AI as applied to health care in a practical way as a platform to really energize Optum Insight's business agenda, the need and emergence for value-based care. You combine that with thoughtful capital stewardship and the continued, measured, thoughtful expansion into the value-added markets, that's why I think that long-term growth rate for this enterprise.

And responding to the margins or the pressures in the marketplace has actually never been better, but we have to play to full potential, and we have to execute. And that really is what we're about. But we have an amazing set of resources to respond to the needs of the marketplace. And that's why I think the long-term growth for this enterprise is kind of more compelling than ever.

And we'll go next to Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities.

Ann Hynes
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

In your prepared remarks, you talked about your trend expectations for 2026 is up 10%. Can you tell us what that is Medicare, Medicaid and commercial and maybe how 2025 ended and what was different versus your expectations?

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

Tim?

Timothy Noel
Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Business

Yes. Thanks, Ann, for the question. So you're correct. The 10% is a number that reflects our utilization assumptions inside of Medicare. 2025 closed out around 7.5%, which is what we've kind of reset our expectation through middle point of the year. So that really is playing out well at a high level in terms of historical care utilization patterns in line with our reset expectations.

We have historically or recently talked about the commercial trend approaching 11%. I think that's probably still a good place to orientate to, and due to some of the nuance in the Medicaid market, where it's not quite as instructive to give a point estimate there. But I think you can just think about the themes really being similar across all the businesses, seeing elevated trend that elevated in the earlier part of 2025 remains at those elevated levels. And our expectation is that will persist into 2026.

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

Thanks, Tim. I think we have time for maybe just one more question or 2 because we're going to try to wrap it up at 8.

Operator

And our next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.

Erin Wilson Wright
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. So it seems like you're progressing according to plan with the Optum turnaround, but have there been any surprises that have come out of some of the initiatives there, especially at Optum Care? And just I think you're still saying that the long-term margin target, 6% to 8%, is still intact. I just want to confirm that.

And then just in light of the rate notice and policies, top of mind, how are you thinking about this administration's support of value-based care initiatives and the integrated Optum offering? And you mentioned just how important value-based care is to operate in this environment. So some context there would be helpful.

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

Sure. Krista, do you want to kick it off?

Krista Nelson
Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Community & State

Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Erin, for the question. So a couple of things. You asked about just how we're progressing and if we've seen any surprises? No. I think as we've gone through the evaluation I described in the fourth quarter and as we've started to look at performance in each business and as we've made some decisions to improve our footprint and our market portfolio and getting some of that behind us, I actually feel better about our 2026 position and our foundation by which we will be building off of.

Your second question was on the 6% to 8% and if that's still intact, and the answer is yes. Like I mentioned earlier, the examples I described in Houston. We have a number of examples like that where I described our mature value-based cohorts already performing inside that. Again, those are reasons to give us confidence. That being said, we do have work to do, which is we've laid that out thoughtfully.

And I think in terms of progression of earnings, we're looking at modest basis point improvement inside 2026 as investments take shape and as we overcome the last year of V28 with building stronger momentum in the back half of the year, setting us up for 2027.

And then the last part of your question around just the support of value-based care. What we've got is a very unique, integrated, value-based care delivery system that continues to demonstrate value to patients served, higher quality outcomes and a total cost of care that is significantly better than all market alternatives. And this system, like I mentioned earlier, is aligned around an aligned payment model, which incentivizes preventive care and holistic care.

And comparing that to a system that rewards for volume is just a system that we need more of. And we feel even stronger today about that need and the greater possibilities for Optum Health than we have before. So thanks for the question.

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

Totally perfect. And the pressure in the marketplace just actually makes value-based care more compelling and the retention of patients to value-based care is very strong.

Operator

Our last question comes from Jessica Tassan with Piper Sandler.

Jessica Tassan
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

So what would you highlight for investors from the independent reviews of UNH business practices that you all published in December? And is there any way to draw confidence around UHC and Optum Health's ability to contend with risk adjustment reform from some of those reviews?

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

Sure. I'll just offer broadly. They were actually very positive. They really did speak. They were more focused on the overall environment, the controls, the oversight, the governance with respect to those areas of practice and particularly in risk assessment. And so we were pleased with that, and we are following that with really our own independent review in terms of risk accuracy.

Chris?

Christopher Zaetta
Executive VP, Chief Legal Officer & Corporate Secretary

Yes. I'll just follow up to say that I think the reports really are focused on trying to advance trust and transparency in these areas. And in 2026, we are going to do at least 3 or 4 more of these reviews that will be really focused on the metrics that come out of it. While 2025 was really focused on the policies, procedures, compliance, oversight, all of which were strong and robust, 2026 will focus on risk assessment accuracy and metrics, clinical policy accuracy and pharmacy services.

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

And we have reviewed these with the administration. So we are very much open and continuing this course, again, recognizing the long-term responsibility for trust and transparency in this. So I really appreciate the question, a good one to end with.

It is really all we have time for now. What I would say is the momentum inside this organization is palpable. We still have work to do to continue to successfully build and progress over the next several months, and we are eager to get to it. But I'm very pleased with the performance and outlook that we have. Thank you for your time today.

And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.
