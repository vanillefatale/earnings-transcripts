[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.

Irwin Boruchow
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Can you hear me?

Rati Levesque
President, CEO & Director

Yes, we can hear you, Ike.

Irwin Boruchow
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Great. I have one question and one follow-up. I guess, a solid quarter. I guess I'm more impressed by the 4Q GMV growth guide, pretty impressive growth rates you're guiding to. Maybe just could you speak to the confidence you have in that plan? And maybe what are you seeing quarter-to-date that helps inform your targets?

Rati Levesque
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thank you for the question. As far as our Q4 guide and the confidence in the business, a couple of different things. We're seeing 17%. I think we guided to about 17% in the midrange on growth rates. As you know, we're a supply-focused business. And we're seeing our growth playbook work. We're seeing sales, marketing, retail really coming together. The compensation structure that we launched in Q3 is now accelerated to our entire sales organization. Smart sales is driving conversion.

Our team is really focused on relationships that art and science coming together. And then we're seeing some early signs of the referral and affiliate programs. Early results are good as we test our way into that. The AI smart scoring and prospecting to drive new sellers, we're seeing double-digit new seller growth there. I talked a little bit about my -- the high-value pop-up events in my prepared remarks, that's strengthening our relationship with sellers. So as the market leader is definitely seeing great momentum. The market is shifting. It's great to see more attention to resale as we change the way people shop.

Irwin Boruchow
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Great. And then just one more question about the growth rates you guys have put up this year are pretty phenomenal. You have to lap that, which is a good problem to have. Are there any guardrails you can maybe put around next year? I mean, not looking for anything specific, but how should we think about your algo, maybe flow-through rates Ajay, as you typically will give us? Just some guardrails on how to think about next year and how you plan to lap these robust results.

Ajay Gopal
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks for the question. We're really pleased with the results we're seeing right now. Q3 was up 20%. We're guiding to 17% for Q4 at the midpoint. You've heard us talk about how we see a growth rate in between high single digits to low double digits as being the right balance, the optimal balance between growing our top line and expanding our EBITDA margins. We continue to think that is the right range for us in the medium term. That said, I would say, given the momentum we are experiencing today, we think that in the short term, so let's say, first half of 2026, we're probably indexing closer to the high end of that range, so closer to low double-digit growth rates.

Your next question will come from Robert Brooks with Northland Securities.

Robert Brooks
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

Looking back at my notes, I believe you guys began to expand the drop shipping initiatives last quarter in fine jewelry. So I was curious to hear how that went and maybe looking forward, what are sort of the next milestones to be watching for as drop shipping is further tested and validated before a more full-scale rollout?

Rati Levesque
President, CEO & Director

Bobby, thanks for the question. On drop ship, this year was really about testing and learning. I've mentioned that in the past and building the capabilities, starting with watches, handbags and more recently, jewelry. At the end of the day, it's really one tactic to bring on incremental supply. I also see it as a way to onboard international partners in the future. So we do think after testing, learning, kind of tweaking the models, we think it can be a meaningful contribution, but I'd say in the medium term.

Robert Brooks
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just stepping back to the revenue growth. It was great this quarter. And as I said earlier, it's been great this year. And I just wanted to get a sense of like, obviously, you guys are a supply-constrained business, but -- and how much of this supply -- how much of the revenue growth maybe is product, is your ability to process the supply you have coming in quicker and therefore, getting those items on the site quicker versus how much of it is just overall more supply coming through the door?

Rati Levesque
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So thanks, Bobby. I mean it's really around how much supply is coming through the door. That's really where we're focused. So that's why we talk about the growth playbook. And again, that's sales, marketing, retail coming together. We're also seeing some success in social and seeing some green shoots there and kind of strengthening that relationship with the seller. So really focused on the supply side of things. And at the end of the day, the cool thing is, like I mentioned, 58% of shoppers prefer or now prefer the secondary market. And then we're seeing it in the consignor growth numbers, now double-digit consignor growth numbers. So seeing that strong willingness to spend because of the trust we built and because of the strategic moats that we've built along the way.

Robert Brooks
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

Got it. And then just last question for me is just a year in the seat, you mentioned it in the prepared remarks, Rati. I was just curious if you could speak to the lessons maybe learned so far or stuff that maybe has exceeded expectations. Just curious to get kind of a high-level thought there.

Rati Levesque
President, CEO & Director

Yes, sure. Definitely been an exciting year, and we're definitely seeing the market shift. Like I said, it's great to see more attention to resale. But I think 1 year ago, we laid out our foundation for our 3 strategic pillars: profitable growth, operational efficiencies and obsessing over service. And so we're really seeing that work. I'm proud of the progress that we're making, right? The 20% growth, the EBITDA margin at 5% now and expanding.

I'd say trust is up 8 points year-over-year and are active, both sellers and buyers are accelerating. We also, less than a year ago, now talked about Athena and launched Athena. And now by the end of the year, it's going to be about 30% to 40% of our inventory. So really, at the end of the day, continuing to become the trusted advisers to our sellers, enriching that data for the seller experience and closing $2 billion in GMV in our history. So building that strong foundation, seeing the momentum. And we really do believe the best is yet to come.

Our next question will come from Ashley Owens with KeyBanc.

Ashley Owens
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Congrats as well. So maybe broadly, just to start, I want to ask about the competitive dynamics. I know you've provided some good metrics around your flywheel and acquisition. Just curious with secondary and retail becoming a bigger choice among consumers, how are you seeing the competitive environment evolve, particularly around new entrants, supply acquisition and then pricing? And then additionally, have you observed any change in competitive or discounting intensity from peers?

Rati Levesque
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Ashley, for the question. A couple of different things. First, again, the market shift has been great to see. All attention to resale is helpful. The $200 billion TAM is great, and we're able to capitalize on it because we are the market leader. And then really focused on our moat and our strategic moats at the end of the day around expertise, data, our sales team, all the insights that we have, the diverse product offering is really important. And that's how we built trust, right, with our community of now over 40 million members. The sales piece, relationships to unlock supply driven by insights that, again, art and science, the infrastructure and data we built to process one of one items, single SKU items is hard to replicate. And at this point, 14, 15 years ahead of the curve. So resale is no longer reacting to the fashion industry, but driving it. And I think at the end of the day, we're able to capitalize that being the leaders here.

Ashley Owens
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up. So for the fourth quarter EBITDA, could you just help us unpack what's embedded in the bridge, particularly within G&A and other OpEx buckets and what dynamics do you expect to carry through 4Q? I know ops and techs have been leveraging at a really strong rate for the past several quarters and accelerated with some of the further automation initiatives you've been working on. So just any color there would be helpful.

Ajay Gopal
Chief Financial Officer

Ashley, thanks for the question. Yes. So on Q4, as it relates to EBITDA, I would say we expect a continuation of our focus on operating efficiencies. You've seen this translate into strong operating expense leverage in Q3. We leveraged -- we saw leverage in our operations and tech line of 370 basis points as well as on SG&A of 150 basis points. Going forward, ops and tech will continue to be where we see most OpEx leverage coming from, and this is where we bring the power of our AI-driven initiatives like Athena to bear on improving margins. We will also continue to see similar levels in SG&A. We're investing in helping our sales team be more efficient. You heard Rati talk about how the value of supply increased by 12% for existing luxury manager. We think trends like that will continue as we build on these investments and will be a source of leverage for us going forward as well.

Our next question will come from Marvin Fong with BTIG.

Marvin Fong
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Can you hear me?

Rati Levesque
President, CEO & Director

Yes.

Marvin Fong
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Sorry about that. Congratulations on the strong results. Maybe I could start, you mentioned half the benefit in AOV coming from units as well as the other half from ASP. So I think that's 6 and 6 and both improved versus last quarter. So just maybe a finer point on each of those. With ASP, I think there was a mix benefit there. Was there anything beneficial coming from the tariff side that you call out as well? And then on the units, would just kind of love to unpack what you think is kind of driving that other than just the fact that it looks like buyers are enjoying the site, but anything you're doing there to drive that or category-wise that people might be purchasing more of and adding to their baskets?

Ajay Gopal
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Marvin. I'll take this question. We're seeing a healthy balance in how our growth is split into price and unit volume. If you unpack our growth rate in Q3 of 20%, we see a pretty even split. So roughly half of it came from growth in ASP and half of it came from growth in volume. Going deeper into ASP, this is largely driven by the things we've been focused on. And a few that I would highlight. You heard us talk about our new sales compensation plan. That plan rewards our luxury managers for bringing in value over volume, and we're seeing that translate into our mix shifting into higher-value items. The other thing that's helping on the ASP side is our pricing algorithm. So our AI-driven pricing algorithm has been in place for a while, but we've been steadily expanding coverage and expanding it to cover more and more items. And every time we do that, we see how the model, given its precision, is able to capture incremental price on behalf of our sellers.

The last thing I would point to on that aspect is just how our investments in authentication and building customer trust have allowed us to capitalize on the growing interest in fine jewelry. We've been able to bring in more supply, and we've been able to move that supply very effectively, which gives us -- which obviously changes the mix of our business into higher-priced items. At the end of the day, trends are going to come and go. The beauty of our marketplace is just how quickly we can respond to them and capitalize on the way consumer preferences are shifting.

Marvin Fong
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

That's great. And my follow-up question, direct revenue, very strong growth, north of 46% growth about. Could you just kind of unpack that a little bit in this environment? Is the get paid now product gaining a lot of traction? Or was it mostly out of policy or vendor contracts? Or was it all kind of across the board?

Ajay Gopal
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks for that question. Direct revenues were up 47% year-on-year. But as we've indicated in the past, we expect this to be between 10% to 15% of our total revenues, and it came in at 13%. So right in that range of where we expect it to be. The outsized growth is really explained by what happened last year as we comp a quarter last year where it was a much smaller proportion of our business. So going forward, we would expect this to stay within that range. We feel really good about that revenue stream. To your point on what's behind it. Gross margins have expanded nicely. They were up 370 basis points at 21% in Q3. So we feel good about what's moving through that channel and our ability to drive strong profitable growth through that channel.

Your next question will come from Matt Koranda with ROTH Capital Partners.

Matt Koranda
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

So it sounds like the luxury managers are getting more efficient at procuring supply, and it sounds like maybe the incentive changes were a big part of helping them with that. Maybe just wanted to hear about the next unlocks ahead for helping the sales team procure more supply as we head into '26. And should we think about that as sort of the main channel of supply growth into '26? Or are there other levers to pull on the retailer marketing side?

Rati Levesque
President, CEO & Director

Yes, sure. Matt, thanks for the question. I want to be really clear, the growth playbook, we're a supply-focused business, like I said, but the growth playbook and the unlock in supply wasn't just sales, right? It was sales, marketing and retail coming together, deepening and strengthening our relationship with sellers. The compensation structure was one tactic. We've also really been focused on flywheelers in marketing, and they're 2 to 3x more valuable for us, and that's starting to work. We're getting early days, but I talked a little bit about the referral and affiliate programs. And there's much supply to unlock there, that sales and marketing working together.

AI smart scoring and prospecting to bring on new sellers, again, really early days there, and we're testing our way into that, but seeing some green shoots, success in social, our influencer campaigns. I talked about these high-value events again, and we're seeing just over -- these events are 2 to 3 days and bringing in sometimes $1 million -- over $1 million over just a couple of days. So it's another way to kind of, like I said, strengthen our relationship with sellers. So that, along with resale becoming more mainstream or the market shifting and the great momentum that we're seeing around, like I mentioned before, 58% of shoppers prefer the secondary market out right now and almost 50% look to resale pricing before they even buy in the primary market. So all of this gives us a lot of confidence go forward.

Matt Koranda
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Very helpful, Rati. And then curious on Athena. I just wondering if you're willing to quantify any of the cost savings that flowed through. I would assume most of the cost savings are flowing through O&T in the third quarter. And then maybe just what's built into the fourth quarter outlook in terms of cost savings on the O&T line?

Ajay Gopal
Chief Financial Officer

Matt, thanks for the question. You're right, Athena is a key driver behind the efficiencies that we're seeing in operations and tech. We got about 370 basis points of leverage on that line. And most of that is coming from efficiencies in our operations center. When we think about Athena, at the end of Q3, it was processing about 27% of the items. And we started with introducing the model to primarily lower-value items. We are going to continue to expand on that number. We expect to end the year with Athena touching 30% to 40% of total items. And as it scales and also as we expand it towards touching mid-value and high-value items, we see it as continuing to be a source of productivity for us going forward. We think that Athena can save us a couple of dollars per item as we continue rolling it out. And it will take time, but it's a source of leverage going forward.

Your next question will come from Anna Glaessgen with B. Riley Securities.

Anna Glaessgen
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

Really nice to see the GMV growth notably ahead of the longer-term range you gave of high single digit to low double digit. Just curious if you could maybe share some perspective on the degree to which this is being driven by wider consumer acceptance of resale and overall market growth versus relative share gains with the concept.

Rati Levesque
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So thanks, Anna, for the question. When we look at piece a part our growth rate, we can map it all of it back to our growth playbook. So this is, like I said, sales, marketing and retail and some of the tactics that we're working through there. So that's a nice shift. And of course, we have some of the tailwinds around the market shift, right, around shoppers preferring the secondary market. So we do feel like it's both things there. And then as we obsess over service and our growth playbook and really up-leveling the experience for the consumer, listening to what they need, really thinking about how to create less friction in the experience, making sure that we're being very transparent on pricing and building that trust with the consumer, that's -- we're also seeing that directly tie back to our GMV growth as far as more value coming out of each consignor.

Anna Glaessgen
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And one follow-up on the events or the high-value events you talked about. Maybe you could share what inning are we in, in rolling this out to the fleet and maybe how many do you think could be supported per store? Just anything there.

Rati Levesque
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So these high-value events, they're a nice way to test the market as well. We're seeing 1/4 of our new sellers coming from our retail strategy. And of course, they build the Halo Trust seeing much more high value come in through there. Really early there as far as how many events that we're having right now, and we kind of are testing our way into that as well this year. But given the progress that we're seeing and the results there, we'll kind of launch that every month to every major market. And this is a low-cost kind of way for us to bring in incremental supply.

Your next question will come from Jay Sole with UBS.

Jay Sole
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Can you hear me okay?

Ajay Gopal
Chief Financial Officer

Yes.

Jay Sole
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Great. I want to follow up on your comments about the operations and technology line. I know you touched on this before, but can you just talk about what the right rate of growth just in terms of total dollars are for that line? Because it's been pretty steady 6% growth now for about a year. Is that the right way to think about growth in this line going forward?

Ajay Gopal
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks for the question. It has been a pretty consistent source of leverage for us, right? In Q2, we got about 310 basis points of leverage. In Q3, 370 basis points of leverage. The bulk of that is coming from the efficiencies we're driving in the ops center. I think we've got a long runway of opportunities there. Athena is just touching 27% of our items as we continue to scale it, it will continue to be a source of leverage for us. I would say when you -- when I go back to the comment we made earlier on focusing the business on getting to 15% to 20% adjusted EBITDA in the medium term, our ops and tech line is going to be a pretty major contributor to that margin expansion.

Jay Sole
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I guess maybe if I ask it a different way, like what drives growth in that line? I mean, because the dollars went up sequentially this quarter. I guess based on the guidance for fourth quarter, the dollars go up sequentially again. What -- where are the -- are you investing there? Like can you just tell us about what drives dollar growth in that line?

Ajay Gopal
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Yes. Well, thanks for that clarification. So about 2/3 of that line is tied to our operations. And really, that is driven by unit volume. So while we get more efficient on a per unit basis at processing items as the business grows, you would expect to see an absolute increase in the dollars going through that particular line.

Jay Sole
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Understood. And I guess just remind us at this point, Athena can touch what percentage of the assortment of things sold once you scale it to where you envision it to be?

Ajay Gopal
Chief Financial Officer

I don't know if we put an upper limit on it as we think about it. Today, it's touching 27% of the items. We think we will exit the year at 30% to 40%. Theoretically, there's no reason why it couldn't touch all the items as we continue to get better at running it through our models.

Rati Levesque
President, CEO & Director

And then at the end of the day, Jay, we're on track for taking outright multiple dollars in cost per unit in the medium term, and that's really where we're focused.

Jay Sole
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Understood. And then I guess, can you just update us based on the guidance again for 4Q, it looks like the cash flow for 4Q will be pretty solid. What are your plans for cash uses in the balance sheet going forward?

Ajay Gopal
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks for the question. We are a very cash-efficient business. Unlike a traditional retailer, we don't trap any of our cash purchasing inventory in ahead of the season. The primary use of our cash really goes into investments that we make in our fulfillment centers. So it's automation tech or it's implementing technology like Athena, where we can get efficiencies out of it. Q3 was a strong cash performance quarter for us. We generated $19 million in operating cash flows and $14 million in free cash flow. We expect Q4 to be stronger just like you saw last year, and it really showcases how our business model has positive working capital benefits when we grow.

Your next question will come from Mark Altschwager with Baird.

Mark Altschwager
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I wanted to follow up on marketing. It looks like it was a bigger investment this quarter. I was hoping you could just give us more color on what you're seeing there in terms of efficiencies and then just how we should think about marketing as a percentage of sales, both in Q4 and the medium term.

Rati Levesque
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Mark, I'll start with that question there. Yes, definitely made a little bit more of an investment in marketing to drive some of the growth numbers. It's a key lever for us in our growth playbook, drives new sellers, obviously, brand affinity. You are seeing a couple of onetime costs in that number for Q3. But at the end of the day, if we see investment opportunities, we take them. We do have a high confidence in the ROI of our spend, and we're seeing validation of that, obviously, in Q3 and in our Q4 guide, but we make sure to always balance growth and profitability.

Mark Altschwager
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Excellent. And just separately, any color you can share on customer behavior by age cohort?

Rati Levesque
President, CEO & Director

We have not shared customer cohort by age. We are seeing strong willingness to spend, like I said, built by the trust that we've built over the last 15 years, seeing more fine jewelry watches, handbags, more higher value come through. We are seeing this newer cohort has a higher LTV. We do see -- we tend to skew younger, more millennials and Gen Z over half of our customer demographic. And the other way that we cut the data, and I think I've shared this in the past, is looking at our higher-value consignors because we're supply constrained. We're always looking at the supply and the seller side of things, seeing more value come in from our higher value and mid-value consignors. So those tiers on the higher end of our loyalty program. And then obviously, like I mentioned, focused on the flywheeler, which is 2 to 3x more valuable for us.

Ajay Gopal
Chief Financial Officer

And maybe one thing I would add there. As a platform, I think one of the compelling things about the RealReal is how we have cross-generational appeal. We have customers, younger customers that are entering sort of the earning years of their life, and they look at us as an excellent platform for acquiring items. And then that relationship continues to grow and evolve as they age.
