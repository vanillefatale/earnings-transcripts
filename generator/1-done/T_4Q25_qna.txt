And while you're assembling that, I want to point out that Jeff McElfresh, our Chief Operating Officer, is joining us for the Q&A portion of the call. Thanks, Rocco.

And our first question today comes from John Hodulik at UBS.

John Hodulik
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Two questions, if I could. First, on the fiber convergence rate 42% and increased by 200 basis points. John, where do you expect this level to get to over time, maybe over the course of the decade? And do you expect the sort of rate of penetration to continue to improve from here? And then a follow-up to that, do you think you can play catch-up in the Lumen territory and get to those numbers?

And then second, Consumer Wireline revenue growth looks like it slowed in the quarter. Could you just talk about some of the drivers of that slowdown? I think, Pascal, you mentioned some of the discounting going on, on that side and just how you expect that to progress as we look through '26?

John Stankey
CEO & Chairman

So first of all, I do expect the convergence rate to continue to improve. And we've, I think, shared that we have an objective when we were talking to you in our investor call or our investor conference last December that right now, we've got plans in place that we're going to drive that to 50% and feel very comfortable with that. I don't expect it to stop there. You've heard me say many times that I think we're in a structural realignment of the industry. And ultimately, this is going to be an industry of converged providers that operate assets that allow for consolidated services to businesses.

And if I think back, looking in the rearview mirror on history and you look at what bundled rates were when there were other compelling bundles in the market, we approached periods of time where 80% of consumers were bundling. And certainly, I would expect that at some point in time, over the long haul, you might see something similar to that occur, whether it's 75% or 80% or 70%, I don't know where it settles in. But our expectation is that you're going to continue to see improvement in that rate ratably over time.

And in fact, that's the realignment that we're dealing with here, which is as churn goes up on unbundled customers by a bit, we're dealing with that problem right now. Ultimately, the fix to that is to get to more consolidated customers that give us a better churn rate. And that, that realignment is what we're betting on in our financials moving forward. And simply put, if we finish this year at 32 -- finish 2025 at 32 million fiber passings and we're going to finish this year at 40 million, just do the math on it, and that's how we're basically driving our revenue growth and our share and controlling our service revenues and what we're doing moving forward.

In terms of our out of -- what I'll call the out of -- traditional out-of-region footprint, I'll throw Lumen into that right now. We have, traditionally, just like we did with Gigapower, have been more conservative in our business case expectations as to how we perform in those footprints. As I've shared with you previously, we started the Gigapower construct that way. And actually, we see ourselves in the early quarters of Gigapower performing very similarly what we do in region. And whether or not we can hold that dynamic all the way through the life cycle over 3 and 4 years remains to be seen, but I'm really optimistic right now that we've seen better performance than what we might have assumed as we kind of do our traditional financial modeling.

We expect Lumen to be derated a bit, in what I would call terminal penetration when it's all said and done. But if it's not and we actually perform equal to what we do within our current footprint, that's going to be upside in terms of our business case and our financial modeling and how we think about our future projections that we shared with you in our guidance. So that one will play out over the course of the next couple of years. And I'm confident the teams demonstrated that they can be pretty fluid and creative in how they approach these things. And I'm sure we'll learn some new things and new tactics in how we operate in those markets that allow us to continue to get better.

On the Consumer Wireline side, we were -- I think part of it is if you kind of look at how we've ratably dealt with pricing over the year and try to be clear and where -- as I've said, look for opportunities where we can add value when we do price adjustments, so we manage the customer base effectively. That certainly has been one of the reasons that we've seen a little bit of a slowing on a comparative year-over-year basis. That doesn't mean that I think we're done with taking price opportunity. I think we're just being very careful and strategic when we do it in an intensely competitive market, and we'll continue to be that way.

Pascal in his comments clearly indicated to you, as we bundle more customers, we are making the decision at the front end to provide some better economics to customers to do that. We think that plays out effectively over time through the form of lower churn. But when you do that, you tend to slow some of your growth on ARPU at the front end as you're adding the second product into the household. Again, as I said on the call, I think last quarter, that's more of a feature, not a bug. And we're being pretty deliberate about it. And when you hear us being able to continue to improve margin structure, even though you're seeing some ARPU dynamics soften a bit, look, that's a good combination, and I'll take that. And I think we can continue to run the business that way given our opportunities for managing through the cost structure.

Pascal Desroches
Senior EVP & CFO

John, one other thing that I would add is when you think about just the cadence of the quarter, there were some pricing adjustments made probably in the November time frame that didn't have a full quarter effect that will have a full year effect going into 2026. And more importantly, we gave you our forward guide for our expectations of growth in advanced home internet. That's the combination of both our fiber and our fixed wireless products. We expect those to grow organically 20% plus, and that's all before the positive impact of the Lumen territories, which should bring it over 30%. So we feel really good about how we're performing there, and it is right in line with our strategy.

Our next question comes from Benjamin Swinburne at Morgan Stanley.

Benjamin Swinburne
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I guess 2 questions around your long-term outlook. One is whether you guys are saving any capacity for meaningful spectrum investments. There's, I think, a potential for a lot -- several auctions over the next couple of years under the current FCC. I know you guys obviously have the EchoStar transaction getting ready to close. But just any envelope for additional spectrum investments or just your view on any needs there would be helpful.

And then, I guess, similar kind of question, more near term, definitely getting more questions from investors about a foldable iPhone and what that might mean in terms of consumer demand and upgrade rates. Just curious if the '26 guidance incorporates any view at AT&T on sort of what that might mean for the business and the competitive environment?

John Stankey
CEO & Chairman

Yes, Ben, let me maybe start and then I can have Jeff give you a little bit more color on the device. Yes, we have reserved capacity for other strategic options. My point of view on spectrum is -- I think I indicated this when we did the EchoStar transaction that by doing this transaction, I viewed it as preemptive and opportunistic for us, that allowed us to be a lot more strategic and judicious about what we do moving forward. And I still believe that's going to be the case.

My point of view right now is that the industry is lining up where there's particular spectrum bands that are most useful to particular players in the industry. And we should see a dynamic moving forward where it's less of a buffet rush with everybody moving for the exact same bands all at the same time. I think that, that could be good over time. And I think we can all pick our moments when it's appropriate to go visit the buffet. And that may not require us to be as aggressive all the time. And I also believe part of the reason that we're so bullish on fiber and why we're investing the way we are is we are getting to a point where networks are densifying and the technology is getting a lot better at price points and how we radiate more deeply into networks. And we get dynamics of how we offload as we pick up more our combined customers. We have market share dynamics that play out.

One should conclude that given the depth of the networks that are out there today, when we're all hanging 300 megahertz off of the cell tower, this isn't the days where we're growing 10 megahertz at a time on these networks. We've put large swathes of capacity out there. We have a lot more flexibility in how we manage things. And that means that you maybe don't need to think it the same nationally about how you invest in spectrum assets as maybe you have done in the past, and that has a bit of an opportunity for you to think differently about returns in markets and investments as you move forward. But we'll be in a position to do what we need to do to sustain the business. You've heard me talk about how important spectrum is to this company and our business model, and we pay a lot of attention to it and try to make sure we have the degrees of freedom.

On the foldable iPhone, I just offer a perspective and Jeff can maybe go into a little more color. There are foldable devices in the market today, and they are very capable devices, some really impressive ones. And if you look at the user base who is -- has a strong affinity for those manufacturers and you look at the conversion rate of those that have left nonfoldable devices to foldable, it's pretty predictable as to who sees a foldable device being a good form factor for them. And I think that's a good indicator that if you were to apply those same kind of acceptance factors and put it in and just say just because there's a different manufacturer making them, is everybody suddenly going to be more in tune or desirous of a foldable device. The indications in the market would be that, that's not a broadly applicable form factor. It certainly has its place, and there's some utility that it brings. But I don't think this is going to be the kind of thing where 80% of the base says they need that form factor. I have to move to it.

Jeff, do you have a point of view?

Jeffery McElfresh
Chief Operating Officer

Not much to add to that, John, other than you should expect that AT&T will remain focused on the acquisition of quality customers. We'll be very disciplined in offering the right value proposition to the right customer segment. And then we're not anticipating any significant elevation, one way or another, as John just described.

Operator

Our next question comes from Peter Supino of Wolfe Research.

Peter Supino
Wolfe Research, LLC

Two, if I may. The first -- both on broadband actually. First, regarding your comments on fiber ARPU. I think we all appreciated your point about mix and promotions and how those are accounted for in ARPU. At the same time, Comcast and Charter are behaving differently in terms of the way they price existing customer broadband rates. And so I'm wondering how you're thinking about the price of fiber for your existing subs, your retail rate outlook?

And then a question about FWA growth. Looking out 2 years, it looks like your DSL base will be gone if we just extrapolate the recent decline rates. And I wonder in that scenario, should we expect FWA sales to hold up? And if so, should we worry about a supply-demand problem in high-capacity broadband as that DSL demand goes away and 3 powerful carriers continue to try to grow DSL?

John Stankey
CEO & Chairman

Peter, look, I've said it before, I think we're in a distinctly different place than cable. One is we currently sit under their pricing umbrella. We're not at their levels. So we have a lot more degrees of freedom in how we manage our ARPUs and our various offers in the market that they have. So it's one thing. I understand why they're having to make the changes they're making. They're priced higher and their product is inferior. And so they're the ones that's having to readjust to the market, not us. We've got the better product and we're priced lower. And that's why this is a problem for them.

And as a result of that, I think we've got all the actions we need. When you think about the fact that we have owners' economics on both our products, we can play with the value across, and we don't have to run one product to 0 to make the other one worthwhile to somebody. I just think we're in a great place for us to be able to manage our value to the customer and what we bring out to them. And when you're doing it on the foundation of a better product, that's a good thing.

I made the point I made in my comments for a reason, how do we continue to win and grow in share. We continue to grow our footprint, 32 million fiber passings at the end of 2025, 40 million at the end of this year. That's a growth rate that is -- we've never had that. And it's going to be 5 million a year thereafter. And when we work in that base and you have a product that people love, they love it. It's #1. I said that for a reason. It's priced competitively in the market. It performs better. You put a great wireless product with it. You have all the tailwinds you need to be able to continue to do the right things in the market. And there's a structural advantage on how that technology works and performs as well as the cost of operating it once it's in service and what you do with it.

And then, yes, the DSL base is going to go away. That's by design in the plan. It probably can't happen fast enough. We're working really hard to try to make that done -- get that done in a graceful fashion. The fact that we have access to the EchoStar spectrum has helped us tremendously in managing a lot of those customers into the right place and allows us to preposition a bridge product in some cases before we have fiber deployed under this aggressive rate and pace that we're working through.

And I don't worry about a supply or demand problem. Market really isn't growing too much today, and it's pretty [ stayed ] given the lack of home movement. So it's a tough environment right now. It probably won't stay that way. At some point, I expect home switching to probably increase at some point, and that's going to be to our advantage when that happens because it will open up a whole bunch of choices and jump balls that don't occur today that we're going to win more than our fair share on.

And when I step back and think about the supply and demand, we win because we have a better product. And I'll take share as a result of that. And so no, I don't worry about it. We have -- if you've noticed, our conversion rate on our fiber customers have been dropping like a rock. Most of our growth right now is in new accounts. So we know how to play in this market. We're giving you volume today, and we're going to continue to do it.

Jeff, you want to add anything?

Jeffery McElfresh
Chief Operating Officer

No. You've nailed it.

Operator

Our next question today comes from Michael Rollins at Citi.

Michael Rollins
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

A couple of questions on wireless. So first, can you discuss the macro factors that you may be seeing that can influence postpaid phone growth for AT&T in 2026, whether it's population growth, including immigration, demographics, business and the prepaid to postpaid transfers?

And then second, how is AT&T responding to the promotional changes from your competitors to sustain your financial performance? And within this context, AT&T maintained the annual wireless service revenue growth guide of 2% to 3%. And as you look into that, I'm curious if there's different contributing factors with respect to price and volume relative to what you anticipated when you established the target during the Analyst Day.

John Stankey
CEO & Chairman

Jeff, do you want to pick that up while I take a sip of tea?

Jeffery McElfresh
Chief Operating Officer

Yes, happy to. Thanks for the question, Mike. At a macro level, it's no surprise that the wireless industry itself is penetrated and very mature. And so you do see a lot of switching activity that's occurring between competitors. Are there macro factors that are slowing incremental new entrants into the traditional postpaid voice? Certainly, there is some aspect to that. But from our perspective, the plays that we've been running in this competitive environment have delivered not only growth in our margins, but overall growth in customers. And so we're able to withstand some of the competitive dynamics.

As we mentioned before, and John has alluded to earlier in his remarks, we still see incremental opportunity in underpenetrated segments for AT&T. And those segments are being served at a growing accelerated rate for us with the plays that we're running around convergence. We still don't have the share we aspire to have in some value-conscious price-sensitive segments. I think 55-plus 1 to 2 line accounts and as well in the small and medium business segment, both of which we're seeing some success. And interestingly enough, we're seeing success in those segments as a result of our go-to-market convergence strategy.

John kind of alluded to this a second ago, the actual number of accounts that we see that we're growing, it's not just adding wireless customers to existing fiber accounts, but we're actually pulling existing wireless accounts adding fiber and the new accounts that we're establishing in the market are from many of these growth segments. So from that perspective, we plan for the competitive intensity to continue. It's not as though it's going to abate. And the playbook that we have proof points that we're winning in, we're going to continue to execute that.

John mentioned this expansion of growth opportunity. The funnel is going to grow incredibly here in 2026. A couple of points that he called out in his prepared remarks. We've got pen rates in fiber inside the Lumen footprint at 20%, 25% and we've got attach rates of AT&T Mobility services in that base by our estimate, somewhere around 20%. So there's immediate opportunity for AT&T to continue to grow, to continue to provide value to customers with a superior set of products, and all of that is factored into the guidance that we've offered.

Our next question comes from Sebastiano Petti with JPMorgan.

Sebastiano Petti
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I guess, Pascal, one quick clarification question. Does the year-end leverage target, does that assume some level of cash inflows from the Lumen JV and just, I guess, monetizing a portion of that with a network partner?

And then I guess second question for Jeff and/or John, just helping us think about -- as we think about the shape of the fiber build pace, John, you talked about going from 32 million to 40 million exiting the year, can you help us think about what does that mean from a seasonality perspective as we think about FWA and fiber over -- net additions over the course of the year? I mean, similar to prior years does one half look -- the second half look higher than first half in terms of net additions there? And then I guess, what, if any, distribution changes should we be thinking about as it relates to fiber and FWA, whether it's may be training the stores, opening up distribution channels? Just help us maybe think about the shaping there as well.

Pascal Desroches
Senior EVP & CFO

Sebastiano, a couple of points I noted in my remarks. We have -- we expect to close on an equity partner later on this year, which will bring us some proceeds associated with the percentage of the assets that they acquire. And we also expect to grow our EBITDA during the course of the year, which should also help in our overall leverage target. So we feel really good about our ability to do both.

John Stankey
CEO & Chairman

Sebastiano, I expect there's going to continue to be seasonality in our broadband dynamic. And I think that the consumer part of it, which is the bigger part, we'll probably always have that to some degree. And yes, there'll be better volumes in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. Third quarter will be better than fourth quarter.

And as I -- I think I tried to share all -- with all of you when I was at one of the conferences late in the fourth quarter that there would be some down seasonality in fixed wireless that would occur in the fourth quarter, but none of you listened in your estimate changes. But -- so I do think that's just going to be part of the dynamic that we're all going to work through. And that's perfectly okay.

Now offsetting some of that seasonality is we have footprint expansion. And so we have -- even though there's seasonality to it, when you have an opportunity to sell that increases, you're going to have some volume that comes in as a result of that. And that's going to be really hard for all of you to estimate this year because not only do you have footprint increases, but we have a ramping dynamic we're going to be working through.

We have closed the Lumen transaction in a record time or we will close it in a record time, I'm projecting. And as a result of that, that means we've had a more compressed time to be able to do the preplanning you would normally do at the day of close, to be able to operationally turn up those assets and move forward. And we have some things that we're going to have to continue to finish up and ramp and scale to get to be our best self.

We're going to execute on this asset in a way that we are normalizing products between the 2 operating companies. You're going to do all the things that you should do when you do a transaction like this, which is rationalize your information technology infrastructure, standardize positions on brands in the market, go to common ways of driving supply chains and engineering and putting data into databases and all those things. And that's some hard and challenging stuff. We have all that planned out. In many cases, we're in pretty good shape. But I know that for the first quarter or 2, we're going to be on a learning curve on some of that stuff with people from a different company having to learn some new processes and new ways of doing things.

So that ramp dynamic on that footprint is going to take a little bit of time. And that will factor into clouding "seasonality" as you think about those things. You got a ramp dynamics, you got seasonality. You got larger footprint. You have offers that are going to be moved in the market, training that has to be done for individuals that are going to be distributing and selling those products. So I think it's going to be a little bit challenging for all of you to kind of just go back and look in the rearview mirror and come up with the dynamic around it, and we'll give you some updates. But you should expect we're going to be on probably a solid 2-quarter ramp here of getting ourselves up the learning curve and getting more effective.

And Jeff, why don't you make some comments on some of the distribution changes we have lined up?

Jeffery McElfresh
Chief Operating Officer

Yes. And so our distribution assets that are in the Lumen footprint and territory are already there, and we've got a solid position just as we did with our Gigapower experiences in the markets, the footprint that we were building. And as you should expect that our product offers and our ability to service that base will be available in short order akin to the commentary that John made.

I mean, the pace at which the team is moving to get this transaction closed is record-setting. It's akin to the speed at which we lifted the initial tranche of the [ 3.45 ] EchoStar spectrum up on our wireless network. That, too, in terms of fixed wireless, we expect to sell more this year than we did last year. The ramping of that will occur nationwide as our AT&T Internet advertising and messaging to build top of funnel awareness hits the marketplace in full force, and you should expect that to continue to ramp as the year goes by.

At the end, we are focused on building a durable long-term sustainable build engine inside of the Lumen footprint just like we are in our organic footprint. And the distribution changes that we have to support activating that network in each of the footprints is a play that we know how to run. We don't anticipate many changes to our go-to-market distribution strategy from what's already proven to be a winning play.

Operator

Our next question comes from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.

Michael Ng
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I just have two. First, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the EBITDA growth inflection to 5% plus in 2028. What are the key drivers? Is it more on Advanced EBITDA growth accelerating or the Legacy declines improving? And then any thoughts on 2027 and just the linearity as we think about the next 3 years? And I just have a quick follow-up.

Pascal Desroches
Senior EVP & CFO

Sure thing, Michael. Here's the thing to think about that we are going through. This year, we're bringing in the Lumen assets. We're going to incur a pretty significant acquisition -- initial cost to integrate those assets and to build this and to add to the distribution behind them. We expect those to moderate as you look out the next 2 to 3 years.

Plus, we've mentioned to you, we are -- we -- those assets haven't been fully penetrated. And over time, more and more of those assets will become penetrated contributing to earnings growth. That, coupled with the fact that each year that goes by, you have less and less of a contribution or dilution from our legacy footprint. Those things in combination gives us great confidence we're going to be able to drive an acceleration of EBITDA growth as you work your way through each year of the plan.

Michael Ng
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Perfect. And yes, just on Mobility service margins, really strong in the quarter. I think the fourth quarter was the first time this year it was up on a year-over-year basis, which seems positive just given all the concerns around competition. I was just wondering if there's anything you would call out from a cost perspective that may have been particularly impactful this quarter relative to the rest of 2025 and maybe some of the key cost initiatives as we go over time. You guys talked about AI and digital transactions, but just would love to hear about anything notable for the quarter and the next year.

Pascal Desroches
Senior EVP & CFO

Mike, look, across the board, we continue to do a really good job of managing all the costs that are not geared towards customer growth. This -- in 2025, we incurred a pretty significant step-up in customer acquisition costs along with advertising. And we -- those -- if you strip those out and you look at the underlying business, there was pretty substantial cost savings. You can see some of those dynamics in our trending schedules, and it's across the board.

You look at where we -- what we are doing, whether it's in AI, shuttering legacy footprint and the underlying infrastructure, all those things are contributing. And we expect that to continue. In fact, we expect the next 3 years to save $4 billion -- more than $4 billion in cost. And it's a muscle we have built, and I feel really good about our ability to do so as you look ahead.

Brett Feldman
Senior Vice President of Finance & Investor Relations

We promised we'd give you a little extra time because we went a little long on the prepared remarks. So operator, you can go ahead and take one more question here.

Operator

Absolutely. And our next question comes from Sam McHugh of BNP.

Samuel McHugh
BNP Paribas, Research Division

Two questions, if I can. First, on bad debt. I think it steps up a little bit in this quarter. I don't know if you could give us some color on what you're seeing amongst consumers at the moment?

And then secondly, the guidance and cost cutting and accelerated EBITDA growth. What are we thinking about in terms of cost reduction? Obviously, you've kind of stepped back from giving color on cost reductions. I don't know if you could talk about what you're seeing over the next few years and whether they just accelerate as we decommission copper through the outlook period?

Pascal Desroches
Senior EVP & CFO

Sam, a couple of things. On bad debt, what I would tell you is this. It's really -- we haven't seen any discernible changes in consumer payment patterns. The increase in bad debt is a function of the higher equipment sales that we have that come -- that often comes with long-term receivables and along with just higher service revenues. That's really what's driving the overall dynamics in bad debt.

And as it relates to our overall cost plan, as I mentioned in my commentary is we expect about -- over $4 billion over the next 3 years of cost savings. And I would tell you, it is across the board. Yes, legacy decommissioning will contribute pretty significantly to it. But other areas, we are garnering productivity gains through the use of digital, through the use of AI. And we expect that to continue. And it's a muscle we have built over the last several years and have a high degree of confidence we're going to be able to continue to execute on that plan.

John Stankey
CEO & Chairman

Yes. I'd maybe add something to think about here, Sam, in terms of what we've been doing. We are investing at high levels, and I acknowledge that we're doing that. And we expect that we need to demonstrate returns and improvement as a result of those decisions to invest at a higher level. We talk a lot about what we're doing on the network side and how that's driving revenues and share and opportunity there. We haven't spent a lot of time.

We're investing at high levels in our software technology base in this business to improve our ability to face off against customers, be more agile in the market, take advantage of some of the things that Pascal just talked about from a digital perspective that I think you're going to see a lot of movement on this year. But what's important to understand is we're investing at pretty high levels there. We're getting very large increases in our productivity for the software we're developing and writing right now.

So we haven't pulled back our investment because of those effectiveness or efficiency savings. We're getting more done, and we intend to get more done because there's a lot of good opportunities to apply improvements in software and how we change our processes than what we've traditionally been able to fit through the funnel. And as a result of that increased capacity and improvements and effectiveness, we can see a lot more of these projects now start to drop through.

And so we did a nice job this year in managing our cost structure and business as an example, and I will tell you that, that's an artifact of us having been able to do some more work on software to improve our labor cost structure in that area than what we probably would have guessed we could have done 24 months ago. And so we kept investment levels up. We use that extra capacity to go do a few more things. We get benefits from cost on it. And I guess the good news is, and I think my team is tired of me hearing about it is, I keep turning over rocks and seeing more opportunities to go after things, and we go after things. And I'm not worried about running out of rocks to turn over. So I think it's just a matter of us executing around it.

Brett Feldman
Senior Vice President of Finance & Investor Relations

Operator, we'll take one last question, and then we'll turn it back to John for a few final thoughts.

Operator

Absolutely. And our final question today comes from Michael Funk at Bank of America.

Michael Funk
BofA Securities, Research Division

Yes. Great. Thank you all for fitting me in. John, a quick one for you, and then a quick follow-up for Pascal, if I could. So looking at your national advertising right now, the converged offering, very little differentiation provided between fiber and fixed wireless. So just wondering how you're thinking about maybe more rifle shot targeting FWA for the remainder of 2026 and your view on the market opportunity there.

John Stankey
CEO & Chairman

Mike, we didn't just fit you in. We had a plan to make sure you could be in. So it's good to hear from you. The -- look, we spent a lot of time paying attention to where customers' understanding are of our products and our perceptions, and that's discrete for consumer and business. And we believe, and we've done a lot of A/B testing on this and we know this, that actually we have more to gain right now from a broader, I'll call it, a generic Internet message than at the national level, a targeted message. We want to build awareness that AT&T is a capable national Internet provider across consumers and business broadly, and we have a lot of upside in the customer base to do that. And our tracking of our advertising, our approach on that would suggest we've made some really good calls around that, and it's helping.

What we then do is we come underneath that with, as you refer to it the targeted rifle shot. There are other ways to go put the targeted rifle shot in front of the right customer in the right place. And this is fundamental and core to our strategy, which is right product, right customer, right place. And you can use digital means and you can use information on our customer base and third-party information to go and put the right offer in front of the right customer that matches up to the technology that we have in the particular geography that then comes in and builds and extends on that national message that you're referring to.

So we track a lot of things, as you might guess, and we're looking at do people have an awareness of AT&T is a leading fiber provider? Where are we weak? Where does it not match up against where we got inventory to go sell? You can do things on that given it's a very geographic and regionally centric business to do things below the national level to bolster those kinds of things that you may not see based on where your home residence is and what you do. And you should want us to do it that way because at the end of the day, capabilities like fiber are local, and you want to be very, very discreet about how you do things. Now having said that, when you get up to 60 million fiber footprint, your decisions on where you do certain things in the funnel are going to change than when you're at 30 million. So you'll see an evolution of this over time. I hope that gives you enough context on it.

Okay. And with that, I'd -- go ahead.

Michael Funk
BofA Securities, Research Division

I'm sorry, Pascal, can I ask one of you as well? You mentioned you expect handset amortization to basically be flat year-over-year, I think, in 2026. Just curious what that says about your view of wireless competition in the marketplace or AT&T's willingness to compete?

Pascal Desroches
Senior EVP & CFO

See, a couple of things, Michael, to keep in mind. One, my commentary was that we expect about the same level of headwinds that we saw this year on a percentage basis. Overall, I think, John, laid this out in his remarks, our basis of competition is going to be a bit different than our peers. Ours is about using our broadening base of fiber customers to drive additional converged relationships. That's our priority when we are looking at our investment spend. And that won't -- we will be much more disciplined outside of those areas. Therefore, I think on balance, we are confident in our ability to manage the overall ARPU dynamic despite having to incur the additional promotional costs.

John Stankey
CEO & Chairman

All right. With that, I really appreciate you all joining us this morning and maybe spending a few extra minutes, given we wanted to kind of refresh guidance and give you a little insight into what we're going to be doing after we bring on some of these additional assets. So we've now kind of shared that plan with you. And I think what we've outlined is a view of the future of how we're not only going to report in this business, but how we're going to operate it.

And I appreciate your patience and understanding in our segment adjustments. I know it's more work for all of you. We didn't take this lightly. We're going to try to assist you through it and make sure that we can get you through it in a way where you view it as being completely transparent and more insightful for how we're operating the business [ than less ]. But look, I think the numbers speak for themselves when we start to talk to you about how we're generating profits in this business and how we're investing. The time has come for us to look at things differently. And the shift that's occurring in this industry is pretty significant. And as a result of that, it's time for us to adjust and make these changes.

We have the right assets in hand after we close these transactions in front of us, in my view. And frankly, it's up to us and it's entirely in our control as to how we deliver on this plan that we just laid out for you and shared with you today. And I feel really good about that. And I feel like we're entering the fun cycle here in what's been a bit of a slog over the last couple of years to get us in a position to do these kinds of things.

I believe that we have the right regulatory environment for us to operate this business in. I think the incentives to invest in this industry are strong and good right now. I think AT&T has put forward the right technical and technology direction, and our foundation in that regard sets us up with an ability to differentiate. I think we have the right position structurally in this industry as things are changing fairly dramatically and as we start to approach what's going to be a very, very clear increase in importance and connectivity with the dawn of AI.

And I believe strongly we've got the right team in place to do this that is clear on their mission and their charter. And the combination of those things, I think, should give you a lot of confidence that we can deliver on this plan moving forward. And we look forward to coming back and reporting with you on our progress. So thank you very much for your time.

Operator

Thank you. That concludes today's conference call, and we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.
