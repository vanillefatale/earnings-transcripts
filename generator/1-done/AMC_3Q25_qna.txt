Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Eric Wold with Texas Capital Securities.

Eric Wold
Texas Capital Securities, Research Division

A question a little bit on kind of the concessions and ticket prices. I know, obviously, you had some great success driving up the per patron spending over the past couple of years with a lot of the initiatives you've had within the theater. Just want to talk about kind of the baseline pricing kind of below the surface given the consumer environment we're in right now. Maybe talk a little bit about the pricing power, maybe the price increases that you've been kind of pushing through on both tickets and concessions.

I guess starting with tickets, have you been pushing up baseline ticket prices kind of across the board? Or has the focus mostly been on the various premium pricing options, IMAX, and consumers kind of choose to pay the higher prices for the premium auctions versus raising prices across the board on all tickets? And then on concessions, kind of what are your thoughts on kind of price increases up and beyond the need to offset kind of inflationary headwinds right now, if you feel that's something that moviegoers would be accepting in this environment or if that's something that you think is kind of -- that maybe kind of need to wait a little bit as we get a little further into '26.

Adam Aron
Chairman, President & CEO

That's a question. Thank you, Eric. Nice to talk to you again, as always. I have to be very -- we're happy to talk to the point, but I got to be very careful because to talk about pricing thoughts on a going-forward basis because that could be interpreted to mean signaling to competitors. But I can comment on our pricing actions previously, and you can read into those whenever you want to read into those. If you look at our ticket pricing of $12.24 that was achieved in the third quarter, which is on a consolidated basis, it was the highest number we've ever had in our history. And if you look at our ticket pricing, it's risen pretty substantially over the past several years. It's moved in the past much faster than general consumer inflation.

And I would especially point you not only to looking at our consolidated prices, but looking at our prices by geographic segment. Our prices have increased in Europe and our prices have increased in the United States as well. But I think what's really interesting is, yes, some of those price increases derive from our growing commitment to PLFs. But we've also not been shy in taking ticket pricing up. And in fact, if you go back to May of 2025, just 6 weeks before the third quarter began, knowing that we had some big movies coming in June and July, we did take across-the-board price increases, not at all of our theaters in the United States, but I would say most of our theaters in the United States. And those price increases vary theater by theater and market by market. But prices did go up. And they went up because we think -- again, I want to be careful only to talk about what we've done looking backwards, not looking forward.

Our thoughts then were we ought to cleverly price. It goes back to your very first economics class in the Freshman college when you learned the laws of supply and demand and the laws of charging prices in the peak and charging different prices in the so-called off-peak, charging more in periods of high demand and charging less in periods of low demand. So we have not been shy in taking prices up at those theaters with the most demand. We have not been shy in taking prices up on Friday and Saturday nights when demand for our theaters is at their peak. But one of the things that gave us comfort in being able to put those prices -- those price increases into place is that we also have been maniacal in finding intriguing ways to discount prices for bargain hunters. And the 2 biggest examples that come to mind are A-List. We now have almost 1 million members of our A-List program.

And those people, it's out of -- this is -- we have a similar program in Europe, I might call limitless. But just talking about A-List in the United States. It's only 1 million consumers, just under. So only 1 million consumers out of a population of 330 million people. But these people account for 15% of our total patronage at AMC. That's like an incredible number from only 1 million people. And those people are paying between $20 and $28 a month. And on average, they're seeing 2.4 movies a month on average. But they're entitled to see 4 movies a week. That's theoretically 17 movies a month. And they're getting all that for -- depending upon what geographic market they live in, between $20 and $28 a month. For people who want to seek out a bargain, that's a good bargain.

The second bargain that comes to mind in what I think was a bold initiative by AMC that was announced effective with Tuesday, July 8, and Wednesday, July 9, and what we said would be a permanent feature going forward. We expanded our long-time discount Tuesday offering for AMC Stubs members to discount Tuesday and discount Wednesdays for AMC Stubs members. Now it's free to join AMC Stubs, and you can do it instantly merely by giving us your e-mail address. So anybody who wants to take advantage of the new Tuesday, Wednesday discounts can do so. We stepped -- we made the level of the discount much more dramatic by positioning it as a 50% discount to the typical evening list price on a standard auditorium. So it's a powerful discount. It's available on twice the number of days per week that it was for the last 15 or so years when the movie industry thoroughly had discount Tuesdays.

The fact that we now have 50% off Tuesdays and 50% off Wednesdays also is a tremendous enrollment device to encourage moviegoers to join AMC Stubs because they only get the discount if they're AMC Stubs members. But as I said, you can easily and instantly join. And so like AMC is committed to offering bargains -- but we're also -- we've also proven in the past that we believe we not only can offer premium experiences, which in themselves command premium prices, but we believe and we demonstrated through our past actions, again, not signaling about the future, that we are willing and able to raise price across the board.

As for food and beverage pricing, I'll let Sean talk to that and our otherwise compression strength in the area of concessions.

Sean Goodman
Executive VP of International Operations, IT & Procurement, CFO and Treasurer

Thanks, Adam. Clearly, food and beverage is a key focus area for us, as one would expect, right, because of the profitability of that segment. And when we look at our food and beverage business, the key drivers of our food and beverage per person are the percentage of people participating going to the concession stands and buy food and beverage, the number of units that they buy when they go to the concession stand, and the price they pay. And if you look at the increase in food and beverage per person versus pre-pandemic levels, all 3 of those factors, all 3 participation units per transaction, and price has been part of that significant increase in food and beverage. If you look just at Q3, then in Q3, the percentage participation and the price were the biggest drivers of our food and beverage increase.

To drill down on the price aspect of that food and beverage per person in a little more detail, I think there's a couple of factors here. One is the price is impacted by mix, right? What are our guests buying. And as we've added collectible concession vehicles, we increasingly focused on movie-themed drinks and movie-themed cocktails, that's really helped to increase the price, even if actually the price for the regular item hasn't changed that you have that positive mix impact, and we see that still being very, very beneficial for our business.

The other thing to say about price is we've been very analytical with the data that we have on pricing. So really looking at individual theaters, individual market locations, where can we take price, where should we reduce price. We're very focused on that. And then we're always offering opportunities in discounts, as we spoke about the discount days, if you look at the food and beverage, we have discount food and beverage offerings on those discount ticket days as well. So there's something available for the consumer in. But again, it's sort of food and beverage is really critical to our business and been a big part of why we've been so successful in our per-person metrics as we've gone through the recovery.

Adam Aron
Chairman, President & CEO

And if I can add, Eric, sort of I think getting to the thrust of your question as opposed to the factual answers, I think you were trying to inquire, do we think with angst in the general economy, and like are we somehow constrained by consumer sentiment that somehow our pricing actions will be limited. And again, I don't want to make any kind of speculative comment about what we will do in the future. But I would like to point out this fact. I don't feel -- I think we have to be -- I always say you want to be prudent in not taking prices up too quickly. But I don't feel any price limitation from our clientele. The fact that our premium screens sell out first tells us something. The fact that we introduced 151 XL screens that already were screens that already existed in our theaters. They are bigger than the other screens in our theaters, and we just slot the XL logo on the door to remind people it was a bigger screen and that we're able to command almost a 10% price premium from those XL screens.

But here's one other little factoid that shows you that I believe that our consumer is willing to pay for what we offer. Our merchandise business was literally nonexistent 3 years ago. nonexistent. I mean, like $0 in revenue for merchandise. This year, 2025, globally, U.S. and Europe combined, it's going to be over $65 million. And if you look at the price points of some of these merchandise items that we're selling at the concession stand, it's not hard to find items that are priced at $15.99, $19.99, $29.99, more than $30 a pop. And like literally, one of our biggest problems is that we're selling out too quickly. We are often sold out. We're sometimes ordering 50,000, 100,000 of these units in the United States alone, and we're selling out on the first night or 2. It's a high-class problem. And you do have to order this stuff 9 months in advance and get it shipped in economically.

But I mean, it's just another example. Consumers are willing to reach into their pockets to pay us for the experience that we offer, provided that we do a good job of it. And that's why we work so hard to keep our theaters in good shape. That's why we work so hard to keep our film crew staff motivated and treating our guests well. And just look at the results. highest ticket prices in our history, second best food, and revenues per patron -- I guess it's ticket prices per patron in our history, second highest food and beverage revenues per patron in our history achieved in this third quarter.

With that, operator, I think we're going to turn to some shareholder questions. Sean, what's the first question from our shareholder base?

Sean Goodman
Executive VP of International Operations, IT & Procurement, CFO and Treasurer

Yes. There's been a lot in the press about the Warner Bros situation, and people are interested in what our comments on that are.

Adam Aron
Chairman, President & CEO

So it's a little premature to speculate about what's going to happen at Warner Bros. There are some obviously who believe that Warner Bros will stay independent. There are others who obviously are aware of Paramount's repeated offers. There are other potential suitors for Warner who seem to be emerging. Let me just say this because it's not a reality yet, and so there's no real need to speculate too much. I would like to comment that AMC is thrilled beyond thrilled that David Ellison and his organization, led by Jeff Shell, have bought Paramount. We think they're going to do a spectacular job, and they have committed to greatly increasing the movie count that Paramount will be releasing going forward. Paramount was down to 7 movies a year. We think that Paramount is on record as saying they want to more than double that movie count as quickly as they can under the ownership of David Ellison.

Similarly, Warner Bros has told us that they also -- I think they were down to 11 movies in 2025. And they also would like to be and are committed to increasing the release of more movies in 2026 and beyond. That also is very good for AMC. So I guess with respect to any potential studio consolidation, our attention will be laser-focused on one issue and one issue only. And that is the count of movie releases that's coming up from studios. Clearly, if it's more movies, that's good for AMC. And if it's less movies, that's not as good for AMC. So we're watching closely. And what we're watching more than anything else is will the number of movies being issued going forward go up or not. Next question.

Sean Goodman
Executive VP of International Operations, IT & Procurement, CFO and Treasurer

We've had -- and we were just talking about it a few moments ago, we've had a couple of quarter-after-quarter of really, really strong performance metrics for the business. And kind of related to the question we just discussed as well is people are asking how sustainable is that? Can we continue to keep these key performance metrics at this high level as the industry box office continues to recover?

Adam Aron
Chairman, President & CEO

I'm completely convinced that we can keep these metrics strong, that they are, in fact, not flukes but sustainable and that we can grow them. And what gives me that confidence is we've been growing them now for 6 years, since 2019, or really in the last 3 years since the box office sort of got semi-respectable post-COVID. And we apply as a company so much attention and brainpower, mental acuity to getting those metrics up. They didn't happen by accident. And we'll apply that same emphasis on keeping those metrics strong and growing, looking ahead. There are 2 numbers that kind of fed my head more than anything else about how AMC survived the last 5 years, because look, I mean the industry box office is still 20% down from pre-pandemic levels. That's a problem. Some people don't want to admit that's a problem, but that's a problem. It would be much easier for us if we can see the box office grow to what we hope will be a much larger pace in 2026 than it's been in the last 3 years.

And as I said in my prepared remarks, if you look at the 9-month period from April 1 to December 31, 2025, the industry has not been on the $9 billion pace that it will probably be on for 2025 calendar year, but a $10 billion pace. And it sure be nice if that's the pace that we have going forward. In a rising box office environment, AMC does very well because 2/3 of our incremental revenue drops the EBITDA line. It's not a linear relationship between rising box office and rising EBITDA. It's an exponential relationship between rising box office and EBITDA. So the same attention that we're paying to keeping these metrics strong comes much more easily in a growing box office.

The other metric, the number that -- or I said there are 2 numbers that float in my head. Look at our contribution per patron. Our contribution per patron pre-pandemic 2019 versus say, it's up 54% in 6 years, 54% increase in contribution. We would not be alive today had it not been for our ability to increase our contribution margin by 54%. We are simply a much more efficient operator than we were pre-pandemic, and we don't need the box office to come all the way back to pre-pandemic levels for us to be very successful at the EBITDA line. This other number that floats in my head, of course, is we raised $4.5 billion of equity over the past 6 years and $2 billion of debt, which we have since repaid off not only the $2 billion that we raised, but we paid off more than $1 billion more than that. So our debt levels are actually lower today than they were going into the pandemic. But we still owe so much gratitude to our shareholder base, especially our retail shareholder base, who stayed with us all these years because their belief in our future, their willingness to let equity come into our coffers to keep our cash reserves robust and healthy and strong are why we made it.

Next question.

Sean Goodman
Executive VP of International Operations, IT & Procurement, CFO and Treasurer

Do you want to comment a little bit about the M&A environment? We recently noticed Connapolis' acquisition of Imagin Entertainment, and any thoughts on the M&A environment in this industry for us?

Adam Aron
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. So we ended the third quarter with $363 million of cash on hand. Every dollar of that cash is earmarked. So now is not a great time for us to be diverting cash to other strategies other than running our company well and strengthening our balance sheet. Similarly, we are out of shares. So it's not like under the current situation, we could use share equity capital as a currency for M&A activity. Having said that, over time, our cash reserves will grow from whatever means. And when I look at the M&A environment, it looks quite attractive to us right now.

Cinnapolis, a high-quality operator in Europe, bought 14 movie theaters in the United States at 5x trailing EBITDA, 5x. Now it's only 14 theaters. Like you couldn't buy AMC for 5x EBITDA because we're 900 theaters, not 14. But it does tell you that there are plenty of movie theater circuits out there who have less than 1% market share, less than 2% market share, where we, AMC, if we had cash to deploy for M&A purposes, could pick them up at levels at bargain levels and then arbitrage them into being worth much more if they were part of the AMC network. And not only much more merely because we trade at higher multiples than what you might pick up some of these circuits for the cheap, but also because if those theaters were run by AMC, we believe they would do better.

We have better marketing strategies. We have better purchasing power. And I think our ability to deliver the numbers bottom line beat a lot of the smaller operators who are still around, and what is still a quite fragmented industry, 40% of the industry is still coming from very small operators. So I think the M&A market is ripe for us to move if we have the resources to move. Today, we don't have those resources. But I can tell you that we are paying a lot of attention to M&A activity. We're still analyzing a lot of potential combinations, small ones, not necessarily big ones. It appears to us there are -- there is opportunity out there for us at hand when it's the right time for us to move intelligently, and that is as we can do it without compromising either our cash reserves or our absolute commitment to strengthening the balance sheet.

Sean Goodman
Executive VP of International Operations, IT & Procurement, CFO and Treasurer

Final question here regarding the loyalty programs. We provided a lot of additional benefits to our loyalty members recently. And so people are just asking for an update about that. How is that going with things like discount Wednesdays? So we did just add a significant benefit by adding discount Wednesdays to the mix of discount Tuesdays.

Adam Aron
Chairman, President & CEO

Remember, one of our tiers of AMC Stubs is AMC Stubs A-List. Back in May, we enhanced the benefits of A-List. A-List was quite successful for us before. You used to be able to see 3 movies a week, now you can see 4 movies a week. We made it much easier to use the A-List program because you no longer need to fish for a state ID, a driver's license to get in, you're using A-List just as a flash your phone because we added a picture ID to your profile within our A-List within the app, within AMC app for A-List. So like that's all we did, add a lot of benefit. But the results are just great. A-List started out right after COVID when we reopened theaters in 2020, having only about 500,000 members. It's up to close to 1 million. So that's doubled over the last 5 years.

We also introduced a new tier of Stubs, our loyalty program on January 1 called Premier Go, which gives people double the points generosity that a so-called insider, a member of our free tier, gets and gives them other benefits. It's a path to getting from insider to Premier. Premier, you got there by paying $15 a year, now $18 a year, speaking of price increases. Now $18 a year. I guess my marketing department would assist. I say it's $17.99. So it's not quite $18, right? In the consumer head, we only raised it by $2, not $3. But with Premier Go, you get this increased generosity level. It's not all the way to the generosity level of Premier because Premier is a 5x level of discount. But you earn Premier Go not by paying us a $17.99 purchase price, but you earn it basically by seeing -- making 8 visits a year to our movie theaters, which isn't that hard to do. And the number, we didn't have one single member in our Premier Go tier on December 31, 2024. Sitting here today, we have between 600,000 and 700,000 of them.

And by definition, they're seeing 8 movies or more a year. Like this is really good for us. So our knowledge of loyalty programs continues to be enormous. We continue to reap great benefits from it. And we're doing this not only in the United States. In 2025, we launched a points-based loyalty program in the United Kingdom. The U.K. has always had -- not always, but it's for a long time, has had actually ever since we bought it in 2016, has had its limitless program, which was a model for A-List. But we now have a loyalty scheme in the U.K., just like we have Stubs here in the U.S. And that loyalty program in the U.K. is also being spread to some of our other country territories across Europe. So this is an area where we know we're doing, and we're -- and it's one of the reasons why we're optimistic for our future.

With that, I think is that the last question for today. So I'd just like to close by telling you all, I don't know where you're going to be Friday night, but I'm going to be at an AMC theater watching Nuremberg. It's going to be a really great movie, I think, starring Russell Crowe. And my goodness, the movies we have coming out over the next 8 weeks, it's a parade of one great title after another. I think I can say with some degree of confidence, America and the world is going to be in movie theaters in November and December. We hope we can count you among them. Thank you for listening to us today and joining. We'll talk to you again soon. All the best.

Operator

Thank you. This brings us to the end of today's meeting. We appreciate your time and participation. You may now disconnect.
