[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Koontz with Needham.

Ryan Koontz
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Terrific quarter, guys, just outstanding in the October quarter. I wanted to ask about the guide a little bit here. In terms of the revenue and the margin guide down, is the revenue down on onetime benefits on usage in the past quarter and then the gross margin guide down, is that mostly tied to some of your large international programs you're ramping?

Ashley Whitfield Johnson
President & CFO

Great. Thanks, Ryan. Appreciate the question. In terms of Q3 to Q4 trends, a couple of factors to keep in mind. So I did highlight that there were some onetime items in Q3. Those can be related to renewals of certain contracts that have archived components. Anytime we have any kind of bonus payments or deliverables that can factor into a quarter that obviously wouldn't continue into the next. And then I mentioned there was some upside that was driven by the timing of landing new business. That does continue into Q4, and you see that rolling through. That's balanced against -- we mentioned that both the NASA contract and the EOCL contracts were downsized. So we have to factor that revenue drop into the Q4 guide. And so that is fully factored into the guidance that we've given, and that results in that quarter-to-quarter flatness to slight down that we guided to.

In terms of margin, we're both investing in the opportunity that we see, as we've highlighted, investing into execution against our satellite services contracts, which continue to perform well. And also with awards like Luno B, those are with partners. And so we do have partner fees that go into COGS that get layered into Q4, and that also causes some margin compression quarter-to-quarter. So those are the factors. It really comes down to mix of business and the fact that we are investing because we see a lot of opportunity in front of us.

Ryan Koontz
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Great. And just a clarification on those partner fees, are those front-loaded in some way before revenue hits? Or how should we think about how those kind of behave in the future?

Ashley Whitfield Johnson
President & CFO

No, they align to revenue.

Ryan Koontz
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Got it. Got it. Perfect. And maybe a quick question on the acquisition of Bedrock. I mean, which sectors are these guys focused on? And what sort of data does Bedrock integrate?

William Marshall
Co-Founder, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. Good question. I mean Bedrock is fantastic. It's a small team, but very, very talented at the intersection of remote sensing, AI and national security, very, very good solid team there. What we see them doing, I mean, we already worked with them with actual customers as we're building out our GMS solution, and it's been working really well. And so we thought bringing them in-house would help us to scale and speed that execution faster and make it more efficient to the margins point we were just discussing.

Ryan Koontz
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And what sort of data do they deal with? Is it all primarily your data? Or do they bring other data sources together?

William Marshall
Co-Founder, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Well, they've done multiple different data sets in the past, public and primarily the national security data sets on contract with the government. So it's a variety of things. And it's a sort of versatile approach that they've been doing using embeddings, a technology we've been also working with in our AI modeling work. And so it's the kind of very generic scalable solution that can work across different data streams.

Your next question comes from the line of Edison Yu with Deutsche Bank.

Xin Yu
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Congrats on the very impressive quarter. I want to ask about Project Suncatcher. There's been a lot of talk, a lot of excitement about data centers and space. Can you give us a sense on how you think about just the feasibility and viability of this? And how does one kind of measure that going forward?

William Marshall
Co-Founder, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. Well, thanks on the quarter. We agree. It's really great. And yes, Suncatcher is really exciting. I do think it's a very viable project long term. It's -- we have spoken in the space sector for some decades about how as space infrastructure costs come down, it eventually makes sense to put compute into space and other energy-intensive infrastructure. And to your point about the feasibility of scaling it, well, that is hard, right? And there's only a couple of companies in the world that have done scaled constellations, basically us and SpaceX. And therefore, knowing how to put that -- get costs down is something that really is an incredible advantage we have and competitive position in going into this is one of the reasons, obviously, we're very proud that Google selected us. That's obviously one of the reasons for that.

I see a huge market opportunity here. I do in the long run. This is just an R&D at this phase. This is an R&D contract. We're going to do these couple of demo satellites that would test out some of the critical components of that, like shedding heat from the TPUs into our space and doing the formation flying so building towards a cluster system approach, which is the architecture that the Google and Planet teams have been designing towards. And we think the most efficient approach to this. So yes, so in summary, it's early days, but an exciting potential project for Planet, really exciting.

Xin Yu
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Just one follow-up. I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you're using the same bus as Owl. Are there any special kind of design changes you need to make on the bus, anything you do differently just from, I guess, engineering perspective, given it's a TPU?

William Marshall
Co-Founder, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. I mean there's a few things, but not much on the scale of things. For example, we're expanding the number of solar panels a little bit and a few things like that. But on the scale of the hard complex things of the avionics and all those systems, how they work together, it's primarily the same at this stage. And that's why -- I mean, there were two big reasons we did this project at the tactical level. One was the -- how aligned it was to our Owl project per that point on the same bus. And the second is that there's an option on a big program in the future to the earlier point, I mean, I think this is a big market. So let's take advantage of the fact that we're one of a couple of companies that can do it.

I'll just add as well that Planet, we've been saying is a space and AI company. And I think we have the credibility to say that we're the first one in a way to prove that. We've obviously got scaled satellite stuff, so we're a space company. We've got at scale use of AI based on our daily scan. And we've already been putting NVIDIA chips in space on the satellites, including the ones that were launched just 12 days ago. And so we're already familiar with putting compute in space. So we -- it's a natural extension of where we're going to think about AI and space together in this way. And so Planet is incredibly well positioned for that, we believe.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Latimore at Northland.

Mike Latimore
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

Excellent results. I guess on the quarter, I think you said JSAT was one of the drivers of maybe the upside. Can you talk a little bit about is JSAT sort of ahead of schedule? And maybe just generally, how is the JSAT and Germany deals proceeding relative to maybe your internal time lines?

Ashley Whitfield Johnson
President & CFO

Yes. Obviously, this was the first time we had engaged in this type of contract. And so while we have obviously agreed milestones with the end customer, we gave ourselves some flexibility for when certain milestones might get hit for the year. And obviously, that flexibility translates also into how we guide. And so that team continuing to execute and meet and hopefully exceed the customers' expectations also results in upside in our financial forecast.

William Marshall
Co-Founder, CEO & Chairman of the Board

I would just add, yes, I mean, overall things are going very well with those programs. And we're very focused on committed -- our commitments to those customers. And yes, things are going great. And the pipeline of opportunities for further deals is going really well as well. So yes, we're very happy with that side of the business, too.

Mike Latimore
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

Great. And then Ashley, did you say that the -- you expect the fourth quarter kind of implied growth rate to be sort of continue into fiscal '27, as well?

Ashley Whitfield Johnson
President & CFO

I did, yes. So as we're looking at the shape of the business, and kind of the drivers of growth. Q4 is pretty indicative of how we see things going forward. Obviously, I've mentioned the change in the government contracts, those go into full effect in Q4. We've obviously continued to land new business and expand relationships, both with the U.S. government and international governments. And we expect across all of the areas of business to continue to focus on converting the pipeline that we have. So we're very comfortable with that as kind of a target for growth going into fiscal '27. And also as we think about margins next year, that's a pretty good benchmark to use as a reference.

William Marshall
Co-Founder, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. And we said at the beginning of the year, we would accelerate the revenue growth rate. And here we are, and we can -- it's nice to be in a position where we can see that continuing into next year.

Ashley Whitfield Johnson
President & CFO

And then the only qualifier I'd add to that is reference back to the Investor Day materials, where obviously, we're thinking about FY '27 very actively right now, and we continue to uphold a commitment to targeting EBITDA breakeven or better as well as maintaining our annual cash flow positivity.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Colin Canfield with Cantor Fitzgerald.

Colin Canfield
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

Apologies, Zoom mechanics. So just going back to the pipeline that you put together for the Investor Day, call it, 20 contracts, average contract value of $170 million. That tracks pretty closely to kind of the F-35 friends and family. So as we think of kind of drawing comparisons between that portfolio of opportunities and the companies that we're looking at, how do you kind of think about the sizing and magnitude of those awards? I mean is it fair to assume that like we could see 20% of that pipeline convert and maybe the magnitude of that pipeline looking similar as a factor of the JSAT and Germany deals such that maybe it's like $100 million awards upfront? Like how do we think about kind of that -- just the timing and magnitude of that pipeline?

William Marshall
Co-Founder, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Well, yes. I mean, firstly, I mean, I think Planet is extremely well positioned for this market. I mean our technology -- I mean, we're the only ones that have built hundreds of earth imaging satellites, we did 600 so far. So these countries, when they want sovereign satellites, especially at least in optical, we are the obvious first call. And yes, we feel well positioned against those 20 or so opportunities. We're focused on a half dozen or so that are a little bit more mature and those ones are doing very, very well. When we really go in, I think we've got a higher probability than that, but we -- time will tell exactly how this turns out.

We are committed to really executing on this business side and being a reliable partner with these countries, building off a long-term relationship we've had with them in most cases. And so yes, overall, feeling very good about where this is going. Does that answer your question? I'm not sure, [indiscernible] in your question.

Colin Canfield
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

Yes, no worries. I think timing probably might be a little bit too aggressive in terms of answering the question. So good to hear that you're well positioned and looking forward to seeing those awards. Maybe pivoting to putting some numbers around Suncatcher. So if we think of the 81 cluster concept, let's call it, $250,000 to $300,000 per satellite, $1 million per cluster, is it fair to assume that, that has some value capture tail on top of that such that it can be above, call it, an initial award of $81 million?

And then just a high-level question. As we think of Google's R&D budget of, call it, $30 billion a year and the concept that a lot of these AI people that are basically chasing data centers and the like are now pivoting that R&D spend from the development of the systems to the scaling of systems and that scaling of systems likely going through space infrastructure versus terrestrial. So maybe $81 million, is that fair? Or is it above that? And how do we think of kind of that longer-term scaling opportunity into that Google R&D wallet?

William Marshall
Co-Founder, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Got it. Yes. Well, firstly, what we're on contract to do with Google is a couple of demo satellites. It's really just the testing early phase. So we're not getting into the scale cluster. You're referring to the paper that they put out with where they were talking about 81 satellites in the cluster. That's more to do with the architecture that we're building long term. I think you're right to point out that this will take significant R&D dollars, and these companies are going to be willing to put dollars behind it because if it has the cost advantages, which we believe it will, and the experiments will need to show that, we will -- this is a scaled operation. It would require thousands of satellites and many other things. It's just -- but at this point, we're very early on. And I think it's important to think about Google is choosing us in this process is a huge compliment to us, of course.

But one of the reasons is that we're one of the few companies that has done this at scale, as I said, in my prior remarks. And so even though it's on an R&D scale at this stage, we think we're one of the few players that can really build that out. It is not trivial to put up huge numbers of satellites in a cost-efficient way. There's literally only a couple of companies in the world that have done that. And to boot Planet, as I was mentioning in my earlier remarks, really the first proven space and AI company. We've already put fast processes in space. We already do a huge amount of AI work.

And so our collaboration and a bunch of that AI work is with Google. We've got a partnership with the Gemini team, and we've got a long trusted record working with them. So I think Planet is well positioned. Again, this is an early option -- early contract on R&D, but it's an option on a big long-term future that Planet is well positioned to be taking part. Does that answer your question?

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Van Rhee with Craig-Hallum Capital.

Jeff Van Rhee
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

Congratulations. Just a few left for me. Will, on the compute front, as it relates to -- obviously, congrats on what you're doing with Google, and you've been ahead of that embedding compute into your platform already. Just talk about the demand pull. You're pushing it, but to what degree are people ready to consume it, demanding it, having use cases already pegged out and driving value from it?

William Marshall
Co-Founder, CEO & Chairman of the Board

You mean demanding compute in space?

Jeff Van Rhee
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

Yes.

William Marshall
Co-Founder, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Well, look, I mean, this is really talking about putting compute in space because ultimately, as launch costs and satellite infrastructure costs come down, it makes -- there's a point at which it becomes more economically feasible to put those entire data centers in space. So it's not about any particular compute demand. It's about the entire compute demand in principle. But that depends on us getting to that cost threshold. I think it's the position of Google and Planet that we are just a few years away from that. And therefore, it's the right time to starting to invest in that R&D.

There are some types of compute demand that more lend themselves to space than others. But generally, we're talking about the entirety of that business. I would just say, I think similar to Sundar, he was talking about this last week and talking about how in 10 years' time, he thinks most compute will be going up to space. So that's the way I perceive it, too. So that's the way I think we should think about it. Does that make sense as opposed to any particular piece of the compute sector?

Jeff Van Rhee
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

Yes, understood. That's fair. Two last, if I could then. One, as it relates to Pelican, congrats, real quick first-line imagery. Is there a number in the sky or a particular point in time this year? Just talk maybe to whatever degree you can share how that revenue layers in, if it just tends to be very gradual, if there are going to be lumps in that. So that would be the first question. And then my last would just be on EOCL. Obviously, the cutbacks in the first place shocked everybody. Just wondering if you have any more clarity on what might replace what they've taken away, if there's any clarity there. So those two questions. Appreciate it.

William Marshall
Co-Founder, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes, absolutely. Let me take the second one first. I mean, I just came back from D.C. and I can tell you that there is a lot of interest in this administration in leveraging new tech to drive real mission value in the DoD, and we sit firmly in that area. And so we are seeing them leaning in. So despite what you're seeing there with the UCL, a, it's growing. But more importantly, they are leaning in heavily. In fact, I mean, we see this, of course, in the numbers already. The Luno award, the Navy expansion and so on, they're already leaning into this stuff, but I think we're going to see it in a big way coming. So I think the outlook is really very positive. What was the first part of the question again?

Ashley Whitfield Johnson
President & CFO

First part of the question is, as we continue to launch Pelicans, how do we see revenue flowing in? And I see it more gradual -- yes. As we continue to bring on contracts, obviously, if we land bigger contracts. We talked about we have a framework contract in place already for Pelican or for high res in general with USG under EOCL. There's opportunities to expand that. There's opportunities, obviously, to expand with many of our existing customers and new customers. So nothing at this point that would cause me to say there's going to be irregularities in it.

William Marshall
Co-Founder, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes, I'd say it's roughly linear as we scale it and they are scaling as the SkySats are ramping down and then we're building towards what we've said before, ultimately a 30 satellite fleet with 30 revisits a day, 30-minute latency and all this. And yes, we're already seeing customers very excited about leveraging that data, and I'm glad you saw that first light as impressive with the team to bring it out. And the next day, I think the first light came out. So it's really fast how quickly they are able to process all of this and get those satellites up to -- it's almost routinized at this point that we can launch these satellites and get them going. It's really cool.

Jeff Van Rhee
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

Yes, absolutely. Congrats on the quarter.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley.

Kristine Liwag
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I guess, look, you've delivered 4 consecutive quarters of positive adjusted EBITDA and the loss for 4Q is really driven by incremental investments, which are all good problems. I was wondering, can you parse out how much these investments are for 4Q, their duration into fiscal year '27? And if we take out these investments, would fiscal year '27 be adjusted EBITDA profitable?

Ashley Whitfield Johnson
President & CFO

Thanks, Kristine. I appreciate the question. So first of all, at the Investor Day, I talked about the fact that for fiscal '27, we are targeting EBITDA profitability as one of the metrics that as we're doing our fiscal '27 planning, we are keeping in mind, so breakeven or better. So I'd urge you to look back at some of those materials where we talked about just general framing for thinking about that year.

For Q4 specifically, it's kind of a step-up as we're ramping up some new contracts and then scaling the revenue alongside of it. So as that revenue continues to scale, that gives us the opportunity to sustain these investments but get to that adjusted EBITDA breakeven or better goal. So really, the key for us is balancing the opportunity for growth that we see with sustaining profitability across the business. I hope that helps you.

Kristine Liwag
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes, super helpful. And if I could do a follow-on, the AXA contract that you mentioned earlier, if you think about the opportunity set for that kind of insurance type business, when you sign on incremental customers, how scalable is your capability set there regarding profitability? Like would you sign on new customers and have incrementally higher profit? Like how do we think about that versus incremental investments you would have to make if you sign on customers similar to what they're already doing?

William Marshall
Co-Founder, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. and highly scalable. And I mean, the direct margins of this sort of data business is extremely high, I mean, in the 90s percent. What we did with AXA is really cool because just think about it very practically, they're trying to make claims processing more efficient, take natural disasters like floods or fires, have quicker assessments of losses and damages. And instead of people having to send individuals out to check, they can, in many cases, just check that with the satellite imagery automatically from their computer. I mean this is a huge efficiency saving across a big business. That's why AXA has not just bought some data for their own use, they're also putting it on their platform, exactly to your point about scaling it up to other insurance companies in their network, in their partner network on their platform.

So they're providing the platform and yes, the incremental margins on that are really great. And I see lots of potential customers like that in the future. We think the commercial business is going to continue to grow really well in the long term. And yes, I mean, things like insurance and finance, we believe, are massive markets for us to go over after. So I hope that answers the questions.

Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Walsh with Citizens JMP.

Trevor Walsh
Citizens JMP Securities, LLC, Research Division

Cool. I guess around the Luno B contract and the upside in the quarter for Will or for Ashley jump ball, but can you maybe explain or go in a little bit more detail as to how -- that just seems like a very from kind of signing the contract in quarter and then having it immediately kind of lead to recognizable. I mean this seems like a nicer, just better, I guess, execution. And is it -- is that more -- is that actually what happened? Or was there some details around the POC being set up beforehand and just kind of getting off with that customer right away specific to NGA? Or I guess I'm trying to understand if there's going to be more kind of potential with that with some of these D&I customers where you kind of sign the deal and then leads to kind of immediate revenue impacts in that actual quarter?

William Marshall
Co-Founder, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. I mean, look, we're ready to go on these things. We've already got the data. We've already got the analytics, so they can just turn it on. And the great thing -- I mean, sometimes the government can be slow initially. But when they go, it can just be straight away. And so we just turn it on, and that's exactly what happened in this case. It's great to read that we primed that and it's a really substantive award. And it's in an area we've talked about that NGA are leaning into broad area looking with AI on top, and it is an area that Planet believes we are -- we believe we're really well positioned to take. And that's for Maritime Domain 1. It's a bit like our Navy program. And the Navy has subsequently in extensions, been doing that as a sole source award because we're the only ones that can do it. That also speeds things up faster. But yes, the main ramp here was just because we were ready to go. And as soon as they turn us on, we were on.

Trevor Walsh
Citizens JMP Securities, LLC, Research Division

Terrific. Great. That's really helpful color. Ashley, a follow-up maybe for you. Just circling back to JSAT and the Pelican revenues. I understand that the JSAT is not included in your ACV metrics as far as the recurring piece of revenue. But can you just help us understand or remind us exactly how as you build the 10 or so satellites specific to JSAT and that revenue flows in, is that going to create kind of a onetime nonrecurring type of bump in a particular quarter, which we won't really see in that ACV metric because you're not including that in there. And so in other words, you'd have a big revenue bump, but you still have -- that's not recurring, but you have 97% kind of similar to this quarter type of a metric. So not a good way to necessarily kind of track that, if that makes sense. Can you maybe just help us understand the dynamics there?

Ashley Whitfield Johnson
President & CFO

Yes, happy to. And I mean, basically, you can see this in our -- when we talk about RPOs and backlog and next 12-month revenue, it is more gradual. There might be some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter, but it's minimal. It's not something that's going to cause things to swing wildly. But -- so I would say the majority of our revenue still is coming from our traditional ACV business, and it is a very good indicator that we use both on internal managing that growth versus profitability balance, also looking at the health of the business, looking at renewal rates and that recurring revenue. And then the nice thing about contracts like JSAT and other Constellation services contracts that we're either engaged or pursuing is that it actually aligns the revenue quite nicely to the lifetime of the satellite. So while there is an upfront component of the revenue, there is also a managed component of the revenue that spreads the revenue over the lifetime of the satellite.

So it's a mix. It's a little hard to overlay it directly to our traditional ACV metrics, which is why we exclude it. But it is still very predictable revenue and obviously enables us to accelerate the build-out of that 30 Pelican fleet that we talked about, which we think gives us a great competitive advantage and competitive offering.

Your next question comes from the line of Greg Pendy with Clear Street.

Gregory Pendy

On the quarter. Just a real quick one. I think you mentioned there was some weakness in agriculture on the commercial side and some seasonality. Is that just the overall pressure we're hearing about in the agricultural sector? And could you just provide a little bit of color on that?

Ashley Whitfield Johnson
President & CFO

Yes, sure. Actually, it's not weakness, it's seasonality, and it's just the timing of deliverables and usage around those contracts. So as I've mentioned, we get these annual commit contracts, but some of them are recognized ratably and some of them are recognized based on usage depending on the nature of the product that the customers purchased. And so in this case, you see a lot of usage in the harvesting or pre-harvesting periods for operational efficiencies. And then you see that drop off as you get later into the harvesting cycles. And so that's just seasonality that we would expect year-to-year.

Actually, we're pleased with the stability that we're seeing in the agricultural business. And I think that's largely driven by the shift that we've made over the last couple of years to move out of more of the marketing arms of the agricultural sector and really be embedded into the operations of our customers. So I'm actually very pleased with the progress we're seeing in the ag sector and see that as a potential growth vector for us in the future.

William Marshall
Co-Founder, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. If I just add one more thing is that we have figured out how to align our business model with theirs. And now we believe we're in a stronger position to help serve that market. But you're right that the overall segment has been having challenges.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Quilty with Quilty Space.

Christopher Quilty
Quilty Space Inc., Research Division

Following on the earlier talk of the pipeline, $170 million deals and the fact that you're doing the factory expansion in Berlin, what do you expect you'll need in terms of production rate? And is that -- where are you at today? And where do you expect to scale in the next year? And is that sufficient capacity with those two facilities should the opportunity show?

William Marshall
Co-Founder, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. Well, obviously, we are building those facilities, both on our expansion here and what we're doing in Berlin exactly to build towards the demand that we expect to see. So yes, we're obviously trying to do that. As I think we said at the time of announcing the Berlin manufacturing site, that will roughly double our capacity to build the Pelican satellites. And we're excited to say that we're making some really good headway there, found the place and now next year, we'll be going into operations there. So excited about that. But yes, we're obviously trying to match that demand. We are seeing very strong demand for deals that include building new satellites and for deals that involve leveraging existing satellites, both.

Remember, there's a mix between those two and that affects whether or not we have to launch new satellites. But on both sides, we're seeing good traction. And I think what's great about this, again, is that it will take the CapEx of deploying that 30 satellite fleet or more. I think that we're in a great position with so much demand there that will help build out our full fleet.

Ashley Whitfield Johnson
President & CFO

And I would just add to that, Chris, that the team does a really good job of making these different fleets very synergistic. So just as a reminder, the Tanager leverages the same as the Pelican. We highlighted that we're leveraging the Owl bus with the Suncatcher program, and that enables us to also be very efficient in how we utilize space, both for the R&D front and the manufacturing side. So it enables us to run a pretty efficient operation through and through.

Christopher Quilty
Quilty Space Inc., Research Division

Got you. But again, Will said he doubled -- you'll double production to no number given, but how would you like to confirm that?

William Marshall
Co-Founder, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. I don't want to specify that right now just because of competitive reasons.

Christopher Quilty
Quilty Space Inc., Research Division

No, fair enough. And again, on the Tanager, any update there? I mean, are you finding a killer app market or application with the hyperspectral? What are your thoughts on scaling with the technology?

William Marshall
Co-Founder, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. Well, Tanagers got to its first year of being in orbit, had great traction so far. One of the things we're really pleased about is our California partnership and a powerful proof point that has shown that they are able to find methane leaks across California, stop them, have real incremental benefits for both those businesses as well as for the environment. And we're committed under that program to do the first 4 of those Tanagers.

Yes, so it's obviously -- as we've said before, that's a very new kind of capability, hyperspectral imagery. But so far, the results have been really impressive. The signal-to-noise ratio on that satellite, the quality of the data it is producing that is and it's been beyond what our expectations and the users are starting to report good results. And not just in the civil government side, we have early interest in the defense and intelligence sector as well.

Christopher Quilty
Quilty Space Inc., Research Division

Great. And congrats on the Pelican turnaround on First Light. I think was it a record? Certainly.

William Marshall
Co-Founder, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. I think that might have been a record. I mean the team just keeps on getting better and better. I mean, just to put it in perspective, when I started in the space sector a couple of decades ago, this was a really complex process planning for launch. And now it's -- and commissioning and all of that process. And our team does this in their sleep at this point. It's incredible how well we do these operations. And I'm incredibly proud of how quickly and efficiently they build the satellites, get them to the launch vehicle, launch them, commission them contact them and commission them and then provide those capabilities to customers rapidly. And yes, continue to get -- continue to be impressed by that.

Christopher Quilty
Quilty Space Inc., Research Division

Got you. And we've got the -- is it the next two satellites going up will be next-gen 30-centimeter? And can you just remind us what is the fundamental difference in the driver for the improvement? Is it altitude taking the satellites down below 420? Or is it some change to the payload itself that you've learned from the first iteration?

William Marshall
Co-Founder, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes, it's both. It's upgraded telescopes on those future generations, those B2s as well as we are flying them lower as well. So yes, it's a bit of both. So some of those improvements can happen with the existing satellites and some of those improvements have to wait for the later satellites. But we will be doing those next year. I won't go into more details, but it will be exciting to have them up too.

That is all the time we have for questions today. I will now turn the call back to Will Marshall, CEO and Co-Founder, for closing remarks.

William Marshall
Co-Founder, CEO & Chairman of the Board

Thanks, operator. Yes. So I think in summary, Q3 was another excellent quarter for the company. The business is humming, both across the Data and Solutions business, which we see rapidly scaling. We saw the NATO expansion, the Luno B award and more. Those efforts in AI-enabled solutions are paying off. And in Satellite Services, we have strong execution and a strong and maturing pipeline. It was great to see us all of this leading to us beating our revenue guidance again in Q3 and raising our forecast for the full year.

Given our robust backlog and recent government wins, we're excited to share that we believe that we're well positioned to continue the end of year growth rate into next year. So -- and since last quarter closed, we launched those 38 satellites and brought in Bedrock and announced Suncatcher with Google, which is a new and exciting R&D initiative at this scale, but a lot of promise for the future. So the team is just executing at pace. I'm incredibly proud of everyone for the phenomenal execution this quarter and excited for what lies ahead. Thanks again for joining, everyone.

Operator

This concludes today's call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.
