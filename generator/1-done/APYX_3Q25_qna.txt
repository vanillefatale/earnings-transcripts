[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Dave Turkaly with Citizens.

Congrats on the launch and the spending progress. I just had a clarification one upfront here. I know you said the generator sales were down, but I don't think I actually understood the explanation for why that wasn't. You said something about AYON, but I just want to clarify that upfront, if I could.

Charles Goodwin
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So look, we're changing, obviously, the way that we classify things because AYON obviously has to have an Apyx One generator. And if you think of our customer base, we have customers that already have an Apyx One generator, they can actually just buy the rest of AYON and have their existing Apyx One generator integrated into AYON. And then we have an installed base of RS3 generators. They need to upgrade to an Apyx One generator and then buy the rest of AYON. And then obviously, if they don't have any of our Renuvion technology, they would need to buy all of AYON that would include an Apyx One and an AYON with it. And so we're obviously classifying those as just AYON sales even though they have an Apyx One in them.

Got it. And then trying to think about the gross margin impact from this. I haven't -- I don't know that you publicly commented on sort of the ASPs or what the uptick might be here. But I guess I'm imagining that the handpiece and the capital might be premium to what you were selling in the past. And as we're looking forward, I don't know if you are comfortable giving any commentary, but I imagine there has to be a significant gross margin uptick if that is the case. And I don't know if you can give any color as we're all trying to look to the out years now, but how significant or how much of an uptick do you anticipate as this rollout continues?

Charles Goodwin
President, CEO & Director

Yes. No, thanks for the question, Dave, but you probably know what my answer is going to be in that we're not giving guidance out from either a revenue or a gross margin point of view. The only thing that I would say to that, just to give you a little bit of color is we've always said that the Surgical Aesthetics business, obviously, especially in the U.S., has the highest gross margins anywhere. So the more we sell here of that, the better it is for the entire company. But we're not going to give any color or any guidance on what that is right now.

The next question comes from Sam Eiber with BTIG.

Sam Eiber

So clearly, a really exciting opportunity on AYON and getting devices out in the market. But I want to ask maybe about on the consumable side and maybe some pull-through you can get on higher device utilization because of all the new capabilities that AYON has. So I guess my question is, should we also expect a big uptake in consumables in addition to capital sales next year?

Charles Goodwin
President, CEO & Director

So I think the uptake would come back from selling new units to people who don't have Renuvion technology today. I think for customers that are upgrading to Renuvion, they're using, obviously Renuvion after their liposuction procedures today. So I don't know that you would necessarily see an uptick from the existing base. But obviously, adding new customers will certainly help that. We had a good third quarter from a consumable standpoint, both in the United States and internationally. And obviously, we're always focused on driving utilization. So as we add more customers, that's going to be the greatest driver of utilization in the future.

Sam Eiber
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. Maybe I can ask a follow-up on the latest you're just seeing in the market environment. Just getting a sense of any changes to demand trends, GLP-1 dynamics at play? Would just your latest thoughts on the market at this point.

Charles Goodwin
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Look, I think it's consistent with what we've talked about before is we've always said that we believe the market has been disrupted from the GLP-1 drugs. We think that companies that have technologies that address skin laxity and address body contouring and are focused on the surgical side of things are going to be where the action is at. And we obviously think the technologies that we have with AYON and Renuvion are going to be very well suited to this marketplace as we keep moving forward and as more people are taking these drugs and having the side effects from these drugs and then wanting to have treatment from these.

I think the other side of it is it was McKinsey that just came out with the study that 63% of these patients that are on the GLP-1 drugs are new to aesthetics. And so I think we're just going to see -- I think we're in the early innings of this drug. And I think over the next decade, it's going to be a very good time to be a plastic surgeon in the world. That's for sure.

The next question comes from Alex Fuhrman with Lucid Capital Markets.

Alex Fuhrman
Lucid Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division

Congratulations on a really nice quarter and the launch of AYON. I wanted to ask you, Charlie, how much of your growth in the quarter was driven by the single-use handpieces? And what's really driving that? Are you seeing more lipo procedures being performed or better attach rates for Renuvion, or are you perhaps starting to see more stand-alone uses of Renuvion as well?

Charles Goodwin
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So I think the one thing that the quarter-by-quarter is always a tougher way to look at it. As you know, I think last quarter, we were down a bit. This quarter, we were really strong, both the United States and internationally in the growth of handpieces. And I think the answer to your question is all of the above.

So we're obviously seeing new doctors come in to adopt the technology for the first time. We're seeing a higher attach rate from patients that are coming into doctor's office and requesting Renuvion. And so after a body contouring procedure, they're going to use that. And then we are seeing it used on a stand-alone basis. And so I think the answer is all of the above for that.

And again, as people are looking for solutions to take care of their loose and lax skin, especially following the treatment of GLP-1s, I think this is a trend that's going to play out for a lot of years to come.

The next question comes from Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum.

Matthew Hewitt
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

Charlie, congratulations on the strong quarter. Maybe -- and I apologize if I missed this, but talking a little bit about the pipeline. So obviously, you've gotten the initial launch out. Customers have adopted and are utilizing the platform. You've done some KOL events. They're helping kind of spread the word. Are you seeing that pipeline not just grow, but maybe you're reaching an inflection point where it's accelerating faster? And if so, how are you able to kind of get those implementations done with the team? Have you had to add to that team to meet the demand or anything -- any color along those lines would be helpful.

Charles Goodwin
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Obviously, we increased our guidance by $1 million for Surgical Aesthetics in the fourth quarter. And so -- and you can see what that -- obviously, you can do the math and translate to see what that works out to in the fourth quarter from a revenue perspective. And obviously, that is on the back of AYON and our expectations for AYON.

As far as pipeline, I'm not going to comment too much about that, but the team has done an amazing job of get shoring up the supply chain, getting the supply chain to where it needs to be and being able to take advantage of the interest and the orders that we're getting with that we're getting with AYON.

As far as the installations go, we've got a third party that is helping us do that. And so that is taking away some of the burden from the existing employees. And -- but we're doing a really good job as a company of being able to make these to get them installed and to get the doctors trained and get their staff trained and get them up and running. And so it's been a very, very good rollout of a new product and especially a product with this much technicality and sophistication in it, and the team has just done an amazing job of that.

Matthew Hewitt
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

That's great. And maybe -- and I realize it's early days and you're focused on the U.S. market and rightfully so. But how should we be thinking about cadence of rolling AYON out internationally? Are there maybe 1 or 2 geographies that you'd like to target for '26? And remind us what that process is to bring AYON to the masses outside of the U.S.

Charles Goodwin
President, CEO & Director

Yes. No, it's a good question, Matt. And we're not going to get specific on that on today's call. But obviously, we want to have AYON registered everywhere in the world because it's not just a product for the United States. It's a product for every surgeon worldwide. Some of the bigger focus markets, obviously, would be Europe, the Middle East, Brazil, Latin America, some other countries in Latin America. Europe is all together. So Europe, you just need a CE mark. And once you get one, you get them all. There are some countries in the Middle East that actually accept FDA. And so obviously, those we would probably start sometime next year there.

And then each individual country has its own registration process, and we'll be starting those processes in a lot of the countries. So we'll talk more about that when we get into '26 and we start doing that. And you're right, our focus right now for the third quarter and the fourth quarter is solely on the United States.
