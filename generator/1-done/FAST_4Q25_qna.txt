[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from David Manthey from Baird.

David Manthey
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

First off, double-digit net sales growth in 2026. That looks an awful lot like guidance. I'm just wondering, are you guys feeling okay up there?

Daniel Florness
CEO & Director

It's not guidance, Dave. It is -- we look at momentum and that's what -- that's how we're thinking about the year.

David Manthey
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Well, so along those lines, Dan, let me peel that back a bit. You've given us -- of course, you're looking for large customer wins. You've given us this machine equivalent unit goal that you have. But I guess when we see that type of target, I guess putting it together with the 10% share gain and the price you're getting, could you just sort of peel it back for us and talk about the -- just the broader economic assumption that underpins that as well as what type of price contribution you're expecting? I hope that's not going too far. That's sort of fundamental to what you're talking about here.

Daniel Florness
CEO & Director

Yes. As we move -- I'm not going to get too deep into the pricing piece, Dave, because we've done such an excellent job of being wrong every time we talk about it in 2025, that at some point you learn the wisdom of not talking about it. With that said, there are cost increases that are flowing through the P&L. There are discussions we're having with our customer every day about price. And once -- as we move through the year, that piece will normalize.

But the piece we laid out there on that company strategy is really about gross margin and revenue growth, is about having a great plan, but it's also about having the attitude that this is what we're going to do and feel really good when I look at the pieces of alignment with our sales team of our ability -- the market is big. We've talked about that in the past but feel really good about our ability to execute. And we really have aligned the pieces, I believe, to execute well in 2026.

And we're probably, like anything you get a little bit -- after going through '23 and '24, I mean, it stunk. We were struggling to get our traction. We have our traction now, and we feel really good about momentum coming into new year. In fact, I was startled this morning because I had an e-mail from Casey Miller that scared me. And I was actually searching for something Kevin Fitzgerald had sent me because I was preparing for the call and not being in the room, you were feeling a little naked. And I was reading this message from Casey, and it had one sentence. Weather is killing us this month.

Now we have snow in Houston and New Orleans. And all of a sudden, I looked at it, it was an e-mail I saved from January 20, 2025. I just saved it. Sometimes you have these things you save for weird reasons. I'm glad to say we're not seeing that kind of weather issue. Now there's still time left in the month, but we feel good about our momentum. Now I'm going to stop talking before I dig my hole any deeper.

David Manthey
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

That's good to hear, Dan. All right. And then my follow-up on this -- the rebate timing factors, could you talk about what exactly that is? What was the impact do you think on the fourth quarter? And then does that unwind in the first quarter? Just the dynamics around that factor.

Daniel Florness
CEO & Director

It's a two part. I'm going to help Max on this. I'll talk about what it is, Max can tell about impact. And if I think -- if you think about what it is, obviously depending on growth, you -- there is rebate programs that different suppliers have, and you estimate that as you go through the year. And in all honesty, it came in a little bit lower than we were expecting. Now part of that is it's not an exact science.

The other part is we saw something. I don't want to say unique because we've seen it before, but usually it's more of a bad thing and maybe not an optimistic thing. Oftentimes, we get to the end of the year, and we'll have certain suppliers come to us because maybe a salesperson, maybe a division is trying to make a number and they come to us sometimes with a deal you just can't say no to. And I know we'll consider anything if we can get a return on it, and we have the cash to do it. It was crickets this year.

And I asked our product -- our supply chain folks, I said, why was it crickets? Because in my mind, there's two reasons it's crickets. One is our suppliers are so far from hitting their numbers that they just throw in the towel and don't try to claw their way to a finish. The other is, they've hit their numbers and they're keeping their gunpowder dry for next year. The impression I received, it was more the latter than the former.

Now that's anecdotal, Dave. But I think part of it, we didn't see a few of the deals in the third and fourth quarter that maybe we would some years see. And that's probably a good thing for the health of our supply chain and the health of what our suppliers and customers are seeing. Max, do you want to touch on a little bit about impact?

Max Tunnicliff
Senior EVP & CFO

I will, yes. So Dave, there's a couple things to consider. First of all, this supplier rebate was a positive true-up last year, and it was a negative true-up this year. And additionally, compared to the previous couple quarters, this is a -- typically, these are annual amounts that we estimate earlier on in the year, and we bake those into our run rates. And so we had a little bit of a -- call it, little slight overstatement in Q2 and Q3 as well.

So this is, again, just the timing element, it's an estimate. But just to characterize the amount or the size for you, I mentioned in my talking points that the year-over-year drop of 50 basis points is made up of this as well as some inventory timing cost flows. The supplier rebate is the bigger of the two portion. And so with that, we expect that -- this to completely normalize going forward.

Next question is coming from Ryan Merkel from William Blair.

Ryan Merkel
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

I wanted to start off on incremental margins for '26. I hate to lead the witness, but I was thinking high 20s with double-digit top line and then lapping the reload of incentive comp. But curious for any color.

Daniel Florness
CEO & Director

Ryan, from my perspective, that's not an unreasonable number. Once we get -- first quarter we still have the anniversarying of our bonus ramp-up. And our incremental margin, obviously it's predicated on top line doing what we're thinking about. It's also predicated on our ability to manage the gross profit side of the equation, and we felt some pain of that in the fourth quarter. But your number doesn't make me uncomfortable.

Ryan Merkel
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

That's great to hear. And then my second question, just back to price. It has built slower than I think you and we expected. And I just want to be clear on why that's the case. Is it that the suppliers aren't raising as fast as you expected? Or is there other reasons?

Daniel Florness
CEO & Director

Part of it, frankly, fatigue. Part of it is this last piece being a little bit more heavily skewed towards the non-fastener is problematic. And part of it is it's not an exact science. And the dangerous part about us sometimes being so candid and telling you exactly what we think is that we don't know and we're speculating based on what we see and what we think is going to happen. And as you saw in some of the things we thought about in the July and October time frame, we were just wrong.

Next question is coming from Tommy Moll from Stephens.

Thomas Moll
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Dan, you made a comment that you would welcome a green shoot or two. I think safe to say we all would. But let me ask the question a different way here. Are you seeing any of your large heavy manufacturing markets, let's say, stabilizing or not getting worse? I'm just thinking auto, machinery maybe would be too worth unpacking.

Daniel Florness
CEO & Director

I'm going to pivot that one, this one over to Jeff. So I'm going to surprise him on the spot.

Jeffery Watts
President & Chief Sales Officer

No, we're not seeing any real decline. It's really flat. We're not seeing a lot of -- I mean, I did get to note that someone was mentioning that the economy was slightly improving. We're not really seeing that, but we're also not seeing any declines in our manufacturing as far as the year-over-year usage.

Thomas Moll
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Yes. Max, welcome to the call. Appreciate your commentary on some of the capital allocation framework. What I heard sounds very similar, maybe identical to what we've heard previously from Fastenal, but I'm just curious to the extent you can comment on any different priorities or frameworks you might bring to the role. We appreciate hearing a little bit.

Max Tunnicliff
Senior EVP & CFO

No. I would say at this point you heard me exactly correct. There's not an adjustment in our thinking. But at the same time, I'm 2 months into the role and so these are things that we'll look at, but I feel very comfortable, and we feel comfortable with our approach to capital allocation. There will always be tweaks. If I wasn't here, there would still be tweaks. And so we would continuously monitor and assess as we go. And then we'll share -- to the extent that those are material changes, we'd always want to share those.

Next question is coming from Ken Newman from KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Kenneth Newman
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Maybe first, Dan, I think you may have touched on this a little bit in your prepared remarks, but if I remember correctly, last quarter, one of the takeaways there was you did give up maybe a little bit of price to support some stronger volume growth and support some market share gains here. Just to clarify, is it correct to assume that you saw that similar dynamic this quarter as well? And if so, maybe just some help on quantifying what that impact was.

Daniel Florness
CEO & Director

I think we'd struggle to quantify that. Max might have some insight on that, but I'm not going to -- he can offer it up if he chooses, but I don't want to put him on the spot. But I will tell you, philosophically, we love to grow, first and foremost, and we love to figure things out. And there's -- when we're taking on new business and growing, we'll take in the short term that we have to challenge ourselves to figure out the supply chain for that customer. And we'll take that opportunity on every day.

Where you feel the frustration side sometimes is where you have existing business, and we get squeezed a little bit and we need to step it up and push our team and push the market to readjust that. And I don't know, Max, if you want to add anything. And if you don't, at this point, we'll have to punt on a little bit, Ken, sorry about that.

Max Tunnicliff
Senior EVP & CFO

No, maybe to the extent -- I'm just summarizing a little bit of what Dan says, we don't need to right now. So this is a time and place assessment for us as we create value. So we're feeling very good with our current approach and no need to get aggressive in that area.

Kenneth Newman
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then for my follow-up here. Max, just I think someone had mentioned a headwind to December sales just due to the holiday timing. It's not too unsurprising since I think one of your other public peers had mentioned something similar. But I'm curious, Max, if you had any color on what that impact on holiday timing or extended shutdowns were to ADS in the month of December? And how we should think about that maybe normalizing out in January?

Max Tunnicliff
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes. I wouldn't say we quantified it other than if you just take the sequentials -- and Dan did a nice job of explaining why we don't get overly worked up, particularly with the sequentials in November, December. But if you just take those sequentials, last year was like an [ 8.7% ]. And I think this year, sequentially, November, December is like a [ 9.3% ], in that ballpark, you can back into that potential element there. But we also just saw less activity in the very latter part of December. And so we feel like that will just come back into play in January. I don't -- we don't look at this as a structural change or touching on our confidence on where our sales are heading.

Daniel Florness
CEO & Director

One thing I'll add, and we did this analysis last year, we did it again this year, where we looked at the first 2 weeks of December, and we looked at our vending activity. And what we tried to understand is what was our vending activity telling us? When you have a facility with 1,000 employees, 500 employees, you pick a number, we know on a given day in a given week, how many swipes of a badge we expect to see that indicates there's activity in that facility.

What we saw a year ago is we had Christmas and New Year falling midweek. So it wasn't touching on the weekend because it's on Monday or Tuesday, it wasn't touching on Friday. It was that Wednesday, Thursday, which is just purgatory for us because you have these partial weeks. And what we saw this year is Christmas week was a little bit better as far as what percentage of customers were shut down Christmas week. And anecdotally, what we heard was a lot of companies that normally are shut down 24th and 25th, they operated Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and shut down 25th and 26th.

The week of New Year's was totally different. We saw the number of customers that were shut down double from what it was in 2025 -- or 2024, excuse me. And when I say double, that's going from, say, 10% of customers shutdown to 20% of customers shutdown. That's the bad news. And that was -- that cursed the end of our month. However, I'm pleased to say, in the first 2 weeks of January, we've seen a complete normalization of shutdown facilities from what we saw in '22, '23, '24 and '25 back to low single digits. So big shutdown over New Year's week, it's normalized.

Your next question is coming from Chris Snyder from Morgan Stanley.

Christopher Snyder
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I wanted to talk a little bit about price expectations in '26. It seems like there will be incremental price coming. And I know you guys maybe don't want to speak to specific numbers like the prior couple quarters, but could you provide some color just on how material this potential next round of price asks is? We obviously see metal prices pushing higher here. And I mean, is it fair to think '26 price like for the full year average would be above '25 levels?

Max Tunnicliff
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes. I'll take that one. Dan already said why we don't want to get very specific on this guidance, but I would just -- I guess I'd invite you to look back at our '25 trends and just you can mathematically back into the fact that we will have some carryover pricing impacts. And yes, will that be substantial? No. And then we can also just say that -- and Dan alluded to this already, we will continue to go after pricing. But at this point, it's just such -- there's so many moving parts. And based on the way that we talked about strategizing how we actually put price through the market, it depends on a lot of things. It's the input cost and it's the customer behavior.

So I would just, again, suggest if you look mathematically, we are going to have a positive compare. And then we'll, of course, go for more pricing as well. And so I think that's where we'll leave it for now. And as we go in through each quarter, I think we'll get a little bit better view of the world, and we'll try to share that as much as we can to the extent we have the confidence on the estimate.

Christopher Snyder
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I appreciate that. And then maybe if I could follow-up just on the macro. Obviously, a lot of choppiness in the data, whether weather, holiday timing, channel dynamics the last couple quarters. But when you kind of think back and look at the macro or customer end demand, do you feel like things in January are materially better or worse than they were 3 to 6 months ago? Are we kind of still in this mostly sideways pattern looking through some of the monthly volatility?

Daniel Florness
CEO & Director

I would tend towards sideways. I don't think we're seeing anything one direction or another. You're hearing some optimism from us probably because we internally beat ourselves up so much in '23 and '24 as we were struggling that it feels good to be achieving success. And frankly, it feels good to be paying bonuses to our employees again.

The next question is coming from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies.

Stephen Volkmann
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Maybe just a couple of quick follow-ups. I'm curious on Slide 5, as you look at your e-business, those -- that trend has been decelerating now for a while, and I guess it's been fairly flat as a percent of total. Do you expect that to start to reaccelerate going forward?

Jeffery Watts
President & Chief Sales Officer

Yes. I mean that's -- this is Jeff. Yes, that's definitely our thought process. I mean we put a lot of time and resource into relaunching our website. We put a lot of time, not only in the e-business, but how it actually relates to our FMI and our solutions side. So I mean it's a big focus for us next year and we definitely see that to be becoming an increasing number as we move forward, especially in the latter half of '26.

Stephen Volkmann
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

And how should I think about that impacting gross margin or EBIT margin going forward?

Daniel Florness
CEO & Director

I'll help on that one. If -- so within our e-business, the vast majority of it is what we call your e-procurement, which is things like EDI, things -- punch out, it's where we have established larger customers that are sourcing it. It's really, in many cases, it's an extension of a great key account program.

The piece that Jeff just touched on, though, is on the e-commerce piece of it, things like website. That's actually a pretty small piece of our business. That component, it's going to depend on which customer is using it. But even if that component starts to -- even when it starts accelerating, it's still a relatively small piece that it doesn't really have that much ability to move gross profit up or down.

Next question is coming from Chris Dankert from Loop Capital Markets.

Christopher Dankert
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

I guess, first one here, I'd point more at Max. I guess, just as we look at the first quarter gross margin, typically we see a slight seasonal step up. Anything to keep in mind that would kind of nudge us off that typical seasonal movement in gross margin here?

Max Tunnicliff
Senior EVP & CFO

No, it's -- this is an important topic because there are a couple things. So when you just -- the step-up is fine, just keep -- bear in mind that some of what we talked about in our Q4 margins, the timing-related items. So you take that as a factor in Q4 of '25 and then you take your normal step-up and then you can also compare against the prior year Q1 as well. And so that all should triangulate fairly well for you to give you a general idea at least where we're thinking. Chris, even the bonus reset, which can be a little -- can potentially be a little confusing, is only a year-over-year impact but not a sequential. So I think you're thinking about it right.

Christopher Dankert
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then I'm not sure if it's more a Jeff or a Max question here, but thinking about some of the investment spending and investment into 2026, I guess anything onetime you need to call out? Maybe is the fleet refresh in good shape? How do we think about vending? Just anything kind of in the SG&A line to think about for '26 here?

Max Tunnicliff
Senior EVP & CFO

Some of our bigger -- our bigger investments will be in the distribution space just as we increase both a bit the size of our footprint but also the throughput. We definitely have some truck fleet items that we need to push through as well, but that would be less in size. And of course, we obvious -- we distribute through a lot of tech areas like the FMI space. So I would just say, to answer your question, at the top side, it's getting distribution capacity and throughput ready for our future, which is here.

Daniel Florness
CEO & Director

So with that, we're 4 minutes before the hour. Thank you for tuning in on today's earnings call. I suspect a few of you might have watched the National Championship game last night for football. I would like to give a call out and that's to the University of Wisconsin-River Falls. On January 4 -- and the University of Wisconsin-River Falls is my alma mater. On January 4, they won the Division III national title in football. So my congratulations to them. And best of luck to the women's hockey team. They won the national title last 2 years running and good luck on a three-peat. Thanks, everybody. Have a great week.

Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.
