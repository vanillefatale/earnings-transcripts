Question-and-Answer Session


Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Eric Wold from Texas Capital Securities.


Eric Wold
Texas Capital Securities, Research Division

Just a couple of questions. I guess, first off, with the marketing messages that you've been kind of switching and kind of trialing recently, can you talk about what you found has been resonating with the consumer? Is it a consumer that's still primarily driven by promotional offers, discounting and the like? Or are you seeing one that can be motivated by more kind of top-of-mind awareness marketing?


Tarun Lal
CEO & Director

That's a great question, Eric. What is really working just now is like smart value offers. And these are not necessarily discounts, but just packages that are put as a combo offer that allows our guests to appreciate and enjoy both our games and our games entertainment and our food and beverage offering. And if that is seen as compelling value, that's attractive to them. So as I mentioned, one of the things that we have done differently in this quarter, and we will institutionalize as a process going forward is that we test everything with consumers and this value messaging resonated with them. And so we kind of launched this in November, and we are seeing a lot of traction for this message.


Eric Wold
Texas Capital Securities, Research Division

Perfect. And then just a follow-up question on that. You're marketing obviously a combo food and beverage and game. You talked about the food and beverage comps have been positive again for kind of the second consecutive quarter, at least. Maybe talk about kind of what you're seeing as those consumers go into the midway. Are you seeing more or less time from what you can monitor spent in the midway or more or less being spent per consumer? Any kind of trends there you can talk to?


Tarun Lal
CEO & Director

Yes, Eric, I've kind of spent now like 5 months in the company and have spent a lot of time in our midway. I think one of the things that we acknowledged in the last call was that we hadn't invested in the right level of innovation in the games area, in our Arcade, and that's something that we're beginning to do. We've launched a bunch of games in 2025. And moving into 2026, actually, we already have a pipeline of more than 10 games that are associated with strong IPs. And we've tested all of them. So they are kind of lined up for launches in 2026.

So I am really excited about the next year as far as our games business is concerned. In addition, we are seeing a lot of interest and excitement around the Human Crane. And these are now in about 70% of our Dave & Buster's stores. By the end of this year, we'll complete rollout across the system, and then they'll be launched in main event in the first quarter of next year. And as I said, these are incredible games. People absolutely love them. There's a strong TikTok or Instagram value to them, and we are seeing like less than a year kind of return on investment on these games. So yes, that would be kind of my response.


Darin Harper
Chief Financial Officer

And I'll add one thing to that. Just in terms of spend within the Midway, we're continuing to see very healthy spend. And in fact, our guests are spending a bit more, and they are spending more time in the Midway as well. So we continue to see very healthy spending from the consumer there.

Our next question comes from Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets.


Unknown Analyst

Dan, for Andrew. Given Dave & Buster's high brand awareness, are refinements to the marketing media mix enough to change consumer perception? Or are you evaluating increased marketing investment to broaden reach and reinforce the updated value in experiencing messaging?


Tarun Lal
CEO & Director

So Andrew, it's absolutely true that we have very strong brand awareness. I think again as far as the media planning and fighting is concerned, all we are saying is that it should be more data-driven and how do we invest in the right mix as far as linear television, connected television, and digital investments are concerned.

And reach is going to be important, absolutely critical. But I think in addition to reach, I think our learning is that we need to invest equal amounts of money in converting those into real customers. So it's really kind of now using a high level of science and system and process to invest versus kind of more guesswork that -- and impulse as far as media investment is concerned.


Unknown Analyst

Got it. That was helpful. And then one quick follow-up. You've mentioned a refined remodel prototype coming soon that should deliver stronger results at a reasonable cost. What have been the biggest learnings as you finalize that format? And is the aggregate remodel outperformance you've called out at roughly 700 basis points above the system still holding directionally?


Tarun Lal
CEO & Director

So both Darin and I can take this question. So first of all, yes, we're still seeing a 700 basis point kind of impact -- positive impact of remodels. I think our biggest learning is that remodels work, and that's kind of almost a fundamental kind of truth, right, that you need to refresh your assets to ensure that your guests have the right experience. Our learning was that we had kind of overinvested capital in areas that did not really impact guest experience and kind of -- it was kind of wasted investment.

And through, again, consumer insight work, we have now found like the areas where there is a direct correlation between our investment in guest experience and therefore, a repeat visit, and we are focusing on that now. So we kind of -- we are saving a significant amount of capital now in our remodels. And as Darin said, that's kind of like a general message that we just will be far more responsible with our CapEx and general cost management. We will continue to invest. We have the capital to invest, but we'll use it purposefully and meaningfully.

And our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair.


Sharon Zackfia
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

It sounds like the food is doing tremendously and is going to bolster trends. I'm curious, as you look throughout the October quarter, did you see entertainment comps as well improve as the quarter progressed?


Darin Harper
Chief Financial Officer

We did -- hey, Sharon, we did see improvement on the entertainment line as well. And obviously, we believe we've got a lot more to leverage. We've been talking about our F&B and menu for a while for a few quarters now. And so we're really proud of the performance that we're seeing there. And so now that focus on the entertainment side is something that we anticipate seeing some good returns there as well. But we have -- we did see sequential improvement in that line.


Sharon Zackfia
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

And then I know you mentioned continued improved trends in November. Should I think about that as being similar to October? Just curious on that. And then on unit level margins, I mean, there's been pressure there for a while. Obviously, the sales have been pressured. What kind of comp do you think you need to get expansion on that line?


Darin Harper
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So to your first question, yes, interpret that to say November has performed similar to October. Look, in terms of what type of same-store sales, look, we get to flat and positive same-store sales growth. We can manage and expand margins. It's -- while I think you'll see in Q3, we were able to manage our margins relatively well despite the 4% same-store sales decline. We believe there's a lot more opportunity to reiterate what I mentioned. We're very focused on a number of margin enhancement initiatives right now. But look, we can grow margins with comps flattish. And so that's obviously what we're focused on.


Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brian Vaccaro from Raymond James.


Brian Vaccaro
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

So you noted the comps improved through the quarter, obviously. I wanted to ask just the 2-year stack, it does look like it decelerated sequentially versus the second quarter. So maybe you could just kind of elaborate on how you view the underlying trend? And then did I hear correctly, Darin, you said the November comp similar to October, so down around 1%. I just wanted to clarify that, that was the total comp.


Darin Harper
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Yes, that's right, Brian. Yes. No, you're absolutely right. From a 2-year stack perspective, I think it's -- that there was some deceleration. And that was largely driven by the softer start to the quarter relative to where we ended. But if you look at it from a 2-year or a 3-year perspective, you see a little deceleration on that front. But we continue to see those sequential trends in the areas that we're focused on, which really give us a lot of optimism around being focused on the areas that can really drive that same-store sales growth as we go through the quarter and into FY '26.


Brian Vaccaro
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I'm curious just how the walk-in versus corporate events business performed in the third quarter. And just heading into the important holiday season, could you give us a sense of how holiday bookings look or just broadly how you expect the corporate piece to perform kind of thinking year-on-year through the fourth quarter?


Darin Harper
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So for the quarter, our special events was mid-single-digit growth year-over-year. And we're very pleased with the performance that the team has executed on there. As a reminder, we have effectively completed the rollout of in-store sales managers, which has really helped us drive even stronger performance in those locations. And as we look at pacing for the balance of the quarter, which is obviously an important time for us, we're pleased with where we are and anticipate continued year-over-year growth in Q4. So we feel good about where we're going to end the year.


Operator

And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll be concluding today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Tarun Lal for closing remarks.


Tarun Lal
