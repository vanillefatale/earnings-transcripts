Operator

Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. My name is Madison, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Coty's First Quarter Fiscal 2026 Question-and-Answer Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, November 6, 2025, at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time or 3:30 p.m. Central European Time. Please note that on November 5, at approximately 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time or 10:30 p.m. Central European Time, Coty issued a press release and prepared remarks webcast, which can be found on its Investor Relations website. On today's call are Sue Nabi, Chief Executive Officer; and Laurent Mercier, Chief Financial Officer.

I would like to remind you that many of the statements today may contain forward-looking statements. Please refer to Coty's earnings release and the reports filed with the SEC where the company lists factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. In addition, except where noted, the discussion of Coty's financial results and Coty's expectations reflect certain adjustments as specified in the non-GAAP financial measures section of the company's release.
