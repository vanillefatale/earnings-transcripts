Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from [ Calvin Wong with Sticker Capital ].

Unknown Analyst

I would like to ask 4 questions, if I may. And then pre more on business strategies and one on financials. The first one related to your crypto. What is the plan for the crypto segment since you have announced the partnership with OSL, HashKey and the survey with Coinbase so any revenue target or goal from this segment; and two, about AI. Can you elaborate about the AI displacement risk because you are a comparison platform. And three, you've mentioned many times in the press release that you're backed by a few partners like Palantir, [ Thiel ], Pacific Century. Can you share with us if there is any further partnership potential?

And finally, on financials, we've seen that revenue basically flat year-on-year in the third quarter, but adjusted EBITDA actually improved quite significantly. So is that within your expectation? Any -- what are the drivers of this improvement? And why are you so confident in Q4 and beyond. So to recap one on crypto and one on AI and then another one on partnership and finally, about your profitability.

Rohith Murthy
CEO & Director

Dan, do you want to start with the profitability and then I'll take those 3.

Danny Leung

Okay. Yes, perhaps I'll answer the first question about revenue first and then the one on Q4. Okay. So yes, thank you for your questions again. So while revenue was essentially flat year-over-year at $21.1 million. The economics under the hood of the business shift very meaningfully. The core driver of the 68% improvement in adjusted EBITDA was the combination of high-quality revenue mix and structurally lower operating costs, both of which reflect the execution of our modest -- model reset over the past 12 to 15 months. On the revenue side, you can see that insurance grew 13% year-on-year and wealth grew 5%, together accounting for 23% of group revenue, up from 21% last year.

These verticals carry significantly higher contribution margins compared to credit cards, and the shift towards them has a direct positive impact on adjusted EBITDA. At the same time, operating costs, excluding FX, fell 13% year-over-year from $27.4 million to $23.9 million, as you can see. And we continue to optimize marketing spend, consolidate technology platforms and scale AI-driven automation across workforce. Notably, technology costs declined from $2 million to $900,000. Employee benefit expenses fell from $5.7 million to $4.2 million, enabled in part by our AI stack now handling 70% to 80% of service periods. Advertising and marketing efficiency improved as we prioritize higher yield campaigns and increased fixed fee structures with partners. So despite flat reported revenue compared to last year, the quality of what we earn and the efficiency with which we operate have both improved sharply, and that is what is being shown in the adjusted EBITDA. And on your second question about Q4 and beyond.

Our confidence in Q4 and in the medium-term trajectory is anchored in both structural revenue mix improvements and sustained operating leverage. First, the revenue mix is fundamentally stronger now. Insurance and wealth are most profitable verticals now represent 23% of revenue. We have visibility towards taking this mix into next band of our revenue over the next few years, which will continue to rise margins and earnings durability. Second, sequential growth momentum is building. Q3 was our second consecutive quarter of double-digit sequential growth, and that growth came from healthy unit economics, non aggressive reinvestment. Singapore, in particular, saw strong product activity, and we expect that strength to continue into Q4.

Third, our cost base is now fundamentally different from a year ago. So this all creates multiyear operating leverage that continues expanding EBITDA margins as we grow. Combining all these factors, Q4 is positioned to be the inflection point, the first quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA since listing and 2026 is set up to be the year in which we scale profitability while continuing to invest in insurance, wealth and AI impacted operating leverage. And I'll pass it on to Rohith.

Rohith Murthy
CEO & Director

Sure. I'll take the crypto question first. Look, our approach to crypto has been very deliberate, regulated and compliance first. You're right, a partnership with OSL gives us a very licensed sort of institutional-grade partner for execution. Recently, we partnered with Coinbase and we launched the pulse of crypto Singapore, a survey that actually provides like market insight, credibility and alignment with our regulatory expectations. We work very closely with the local regulators to ensure all our user journeys remain suitability aligned and compliant.

And in the near term, our role is to educate, compare and route users to regulated platforms. We're not here to take any balance sheet risk. And over time, we'll integrate these digital assets into broader wealth journey so users can see crypto alongside cash and savings and traditional investments rather than just a stand-alone speculative category.

We're not really setting a stand-alone crypto revenue target externally. Instead, we plan to underwrite it as an upside within the wealth segment with the goals that the digital assets become a meaningful contributor over the next 2 to 3 years. So that's on crypto. Now on the AI, that's an interesting question. And my response would be if we were just a static comparison platform, then yes, we would definitely look at AI as a risk. But when you think about us, a, we have vertical integration and insurance; b, deeper integrations and credit, we've been moving towards journeys with very meaningful data-driven insights rather than just a page of options. And now we have Project Odyssey.

So if you put these together, we see AI actually as an amplifier of our value. Users still need someone to aggregate, normalize and curate across dozens of banks, insurers and wealth platforms, and that's us. Our partners still need a cost-effective, data-rich acquisition channel. And our job is to be the AI enhanced layer between users and providers not just a mere static list. And I think finally, on your question around partnership potentials, we're always in close dialogue with our major backers, including Pacific Century Group. We routinely explore partnerships within the ecosystem, particularly in Hong Kong, where we do see a strategic threat. And I think our relationship with Bolttech is a very good example of how these collaborations can really create value when the infrastructure and capability is really aligned with our distribution and product strategy. Thank you for the questions.

Our next question comes from William Gregozeski with Greenridge Global.

William Gregozeski
Greenridge Global LLC

Rohith, yes, congratulations on the work you guys have done over the last year, really reshaping the company and getting ready for profitability. A couple of questions for you. With the talk about the positive cash flow coming here, is there any plans to use that on M&A? Or do you think you're just going to focus on the existing business and driving that profitability before looking outside the company?

Rohith Murthy
CEO & Director

Great question, Bill, and good to hear from you. Look, our capital allocation philosophy, as I would like to believe it's been very simple in sequence. The first thing we do is we invest organically in the core engine. And you're right, we've really rebuilt that core engine. Second, we're really looking at scaling Project Odyssey, we want to really deepen our AI advantages and even really accelerate our go-to-market for a lot of new capabilities. For example, the Credit Hero Club, the real-time car insurance journeys and even expanding our higher-margin insurance and wealth verticals. And these are where we believe have the highest return on our invested capital and it directly drive our revenue growth and margin expansion. So that's the first lens we have.

The second lens, as you asked, we will pursue M&A but in a very disciplined way because we do believe, as the industry consolidation accelerates, we want to focus on acquisitions that will offer very clear revenue or cost synergies or both, stronger capabilities, a strategic scale, and now more so importantly, they need to fit our AI-enabled operating model.

William Gregozeski
Greenridge Global LLC

Okay. Great. You mentioned the Credit Hero Club and you just launched that. Can you kind of talk about how that reception is going and just kind of give an update on how the loan segment is looking for the fourth quarter with that launch and then in 2026?

Rohith Murthy
CEO & Director

That's the question. Look, the Credit Hero Club is really sort of a marquee membership program we have launched in Hong Kong. It's the first of its kind in partnership with TransUnion. There's a lot of work that has happened throughout the year. And we're very happy we were able to get this launched this year. So the power of the membership program is consumers in Hong Kong will be able to get detailed information about their credit profile for free, credit score for free and through this, we will be able to make very personalized offers on credit products, very powerful in that sense. And to a large extent, it's related in terms of how we think about the personal loan segment in Hong Kong, it's a very important vertical for us.

We have a category leadership there. But you're right, Hong Kong is a very unique market where we do have seasonality around tax loans, and we are in the tax loan season as we speak. And that's been great for us. It's a great contributor to our lending business. It continues to be every time we do have a tax loan season, more and more consumers pick us as a platform to find the best offers, and we've also been improving our overall user experience to make it easier for them to compare offers. We have great partnerships with exclusive offers that we provide. So that will continue to be a very attractive part of our loan strategy.

But now bringing in the Credit Hero Club, we not only amplify seasonality like tax loans, but during, like, say, off seasonality, we are able to now be a lot more contextual, real time and really understand the credit needs of our consumers. And that capability is going to be extremely critical as we think about scaling personal loans so in that sense, we're very excited that we've also launched the Credit Hero Club in the tax loan season, and we really hope to scale this membership program in Hong Kong.

William Gregozeski
Greenridge Global LLC

Okay. Great. Great. And last question is, you've been touching on the revenue mix and the margin profiles of the different segments. Can you just kind of give not necessarily guidance, but just some kind of outlook we should be looking for on the different segments for '26?

Rohith Murthy
CEO & Director

Absolutely. Now when you think about our business, credit cards will continue to remain a core vertical. And the way we think about credit cards is you have a medium to high-intent users. They are very rewards-driven. There is moderate seasonality and you're right, it's a low to medium margin profile. That's how we think about credit cards. When we look at personal loans, they are a lot more cyclical, but there's still a large essential category where margins continue to improve, especially as we shift towards higher approvals, better economic campaigns, Credit Hero Club being a big, big driver of that. And then there's insurance where we have motor, home and other general lines, these offer lower seasonality, there's a stronger repeat intent, and they structurally have higher margins.

And this makes it like a really core EBITDA anchor for us as we really expand into real-time pricing and more end-to-end journeys. And travel insurance is more seasonal with lower margins, but really high volume. And this year, we've done a lot of work on wealth, whether that's brokerage accounts, savings products, investment marketplaces and digital assets that we spoke about. And these carry again, moderate to high margins, and we really believe there's a lot of meaningful long-term upside.

So across the portfolio, each segment serves, I would like to believe, need-based demand, but they all differ in seasonality and margin structure. And that's why our strategy is steadily shifting towards recurring, higher-margin verticals. And we really -- with the target of bringing them from 23% level, which is there today into the next band of mix contribution in the next few years. And we plan to do this while improving economics in some of those cyclical categories I spoke about.

This was a very disciplined expenses, cost disciplines and a sustained revenue momentum, we believe and we expect very strong operating leverage. And that was one of the strategic pillars we always laid out. And this is a dynamic that's going to carry into next year, which is why, as Danny mentioned, we expect EBITDA to improve significantly versus 2025, and this momentum and progress should go into 2027 and beyond.
