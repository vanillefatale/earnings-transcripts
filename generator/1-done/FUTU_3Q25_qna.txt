[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question, and the question comes from the line of Cindy Wang from China Renaissance.

Yun-Yin Wang
China Renaissance, Research Division

[Foreign Language] Congrats for the very good results in Q3. I have two questions here. First, client assets performed very strong in Q3. Could you break down by mark-to-market gains and net asset inflows? And what is the current run rate for net asset inflow in client asset in Q4? Second, customer acquisition cost in Q3 was higher than Q2, but still lower than your early full year guidance. So given stock markets pullback quarter-to-date, what's the recent customer acquisition trend? And what do you expect the customer acquisition cost in Q4?

Arthur Chen
Chief Financial Officer

[Foreign Language]

For the first question, regarding the asset movement, around 1/3 comes from the net client asset inflow and the remaining 2/3 comes from the market-to-market fluctuations. And in the fourth quarter, quarter-to-date, actually, the mark-to-market implication was negative. But on the flip side, the net asset inflows, we see the momentum remains very robust and there's no any slowdown compared with the second quarter or the third quarter.

Then in the third quarter, regarding the client acquisition, the average CAC in the third quarter is around HKD 2,300, slightly up on a Q-on-Q basis. But on the absolute levels, it still [indiscernible] remains our full year's target, the range of HKD 2,500 to HKD 3,000. And in the fourth quarter today, what I witnessed is that both the client acquisition momentum and also client acquisition cost remains quite healthy. So overall speaking, I feel more optimistic regarding our over years client acquisition cost versus our objective in the beginning of this year.

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Zhang from JPMorgan.

Peter Zhang
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

[Foreign Language]

This is Peter Zhang from JPMorgan. We have two questions. The first question is related to interest income. We saw the third quarter interest income record a very strong sequential growth. We would like to understand what's the driving forces behind the strong momentum? And can management help us to break down the quarterly interest income into the key items that is the interest income from the client idle cash from margin financing business and from the security lending. And we also noticed that the security borrowings contribution to interest income has been very strong in second and third quarter. We wish to understand is this purely due to the market? Or is there something Futu has been doing at the company level to lead to the strong growth?

Our second question is related to crypto business. We wish to understand what's the latest crypto business contribution to your revenue in third quarter? And looking ahead, what will be the driving forces for crypto business to expand? For example, is this mostly due to the expansion of the token offering on your platform? Or do management see other potential business like derivatives or staking business may have some upside to your crypto business?

Arthur Chen
Chief Financial Officer

[Foreign Language]

Regarding the breakdown of the interest income in the third quarter we have 2 different source arising from the interest income. Number one is from the clients idle cash. The other -- second is from the margin financing and the third is the security borrower and lendings. Actually, in the third quarter, the percentage for these 3 sources are quite even. Regarding the security borrowing and the lending business, we see a very strong momentum in the second quarter and the third quarter, but mainly the driving force was from the market itself. In particular, there will be more utilization for certain hard-to-borrow stocks in the third quarter.

Daniel Yuan
Chief of Staff & Head of Investor Relations

Peter, this is Daniel. I will take your second question on our crypto business. First of all, I'm going to give you a breakdown of the exponential growth we saw in third quarter, and then I'll discuss the outlook for this business. So the strong crypto growth was quite broad-based across the 3 markets that we currently offer crypto trading. In Hong Kong, for example, our clients' crypto AUM and crypto trading volume both reported triple-digit sequential growth. And as we mentioned in our opening remarks, the Solana was very popular among our retail clients, which is the new client to us in the third quarter.

And in Singapore, we also saw triple-digit growth in crypto trading volume and continuously growing penetration among our funded accounts. In the U.S., we launched a number of new functions, including market orders and added 10 new coins, which really helped driving crypto AUM and volume. And so far, as we've seen in the third quarter, there's a lot of volatility in the crypto market. But we've seen that a lot of our clients really took advantage of those volatility. In October, for example, we've seen the crypto volume continue to grow high double-digit month-over-month and hit a new high for monthly volume and continuous uptick in the crypto penetration. So these are all very encouraging signs.

But still, crypto contributed a very small percentage to Futu's current revenue. But we think there is a long runway for growth in terms of driving crypto penetration on our client base and driving crypto revenue. And in terms of some of the factors and catalysts that's going to help with that revenue growth, I agree with a lot of things you mentioned just now, like a broadening of token offering will be quite helpful and will be a direct beneficiary of that. Of course, derivatives with higher take rate is going to help with monetization. But a lot of these development will be contingent on regulatory approvals. But long term, we are quite optimistic about the growth of this business. And we understand that a lot of these new businesses, they don't really grow in a linear fashion.

Peter Zhang
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

[Foreign Language]

I will kind of follow up on the interest income part of the question. We wish to understand what's the fourth quarter trend on interest income, particularly for your security borrowing business, do you see the momentum continue in fourth quarter?

Arthur Chen
Chief Financial Officer

[Foreign Language]

Regarding your question about the interest income trend, we do not have the high-frequency data set for the interest income, in particular, regarding the security borrowing business, but I'm very happy to give you an update during our fourth quarter results.

Your next question comes from the line of Emma Xu from Bank of America Securities.

Emma Xu
BofA Securities, Research Division

[Foreign Language]

So I have two questions. The first one is about the sensitivity analysis to the Fed rate cut. And the second one is about your R&D and G&A cost. They increased notably quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. You mentioned earlier for the R&D expense, it's mainly related to crypto and AI capacity investment and for G&A staff increase. So could you tell us what's your target or your plan for investment in these areas?

Arthur Chen
Chief Financial Officer

[Foreign Language]

Regarding the interest income sensitivities from the Fed, as we give the market some estimation for every 25 basis cut by the Fed rate, our monthly pretax profit will be negatively impacted by around HKD [3/7] million. But having said that, the rate definitely will have a lot of positive factors such as the trading velocity increase and also more client asset inflows, which will partially offset, if not fully offset this potential negative implications from the rate cut.

Regarding the second question for the Q-o-Q increase on the R&D and G&A expenses. For the G&A expenses, we do have some front-loading costs, in the preparation of certain new markets we may open in the next 2 years. And secondly, we will -- we have invested a lot on the crypto side, especially on the system in the preparation of certain license applications, not only including Hong Kong, but also in other markets. And also regarding the AIs, we will further optimize our AI capabilities, especially for the external part, there will be further optimization for our AI agent for our clients. And internally, we will further utilize our AI capabilities to streamline our business process and enhance our operating efficiency.

Your next question comes from the line of You Fan from CICC.

You Fan
China International Capital Corporation Limited, Research Division

[Foreign Language] Congratulations on the outstanding results achieved this quarter. This is You Fan from CICC. I have 2 questions here. The first question, we see the strong customer growth this quarter. So was the regional breakdown of the existing and also the net new paying clients? And the second question is regarding the U.S. market. Would you please share more color on the market, our strategy and what's our competitive advantages to the other peers in this market?

Arthur Chen
Chief Financial Officer

[Foreign Language]

For the breakdown of the new fund accounts in the third quarter, Hong Kong and Malaysia collectively contribute around 50% of total new fund accounts contribute in the third quarter, except certain new markets or small markets we entered recently, such as Canada and New Zealand, the remaining markets contribution is in the range of 5% to 15% for the third quarter. And at the end of the third quarter, the Greater China clients contribute around total 46% of the group fund accounts and the remaining overseas markets contributed 54% of total accounts.

Daniel Yuan
Chief of Staff & Head of Investor Relations

This is Daniel. I'll take your second question on our U.S. business. As you mentioned, we saw very strong momentum in terms of new funded accounts and also in terms of the engagement of our existing clients with a number of options traders and options contracts traded, both logging double-digit sequential growth. I think that really thanks to our increasing brand influence. And if you've been to New York recently, you'll see that we've launched another large-scale branding campaign in New York City in the heart of New York City.

And another important factor is, obviously, we have a very superior product experience for our target clients. U.S. is probably the most competitive market in the world, but it's also unequivocally the largest brokerage market out there, which means that there's going to be diversified client needs to be satisfied by different players. We think that our product is built for sophisticated active traders and those are the clients we want to serve, and we'll continue to optimize our product experience for that client focus.

Your next question comes from the line of Charles Zhou from UBS.

Cheng Zhou
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

[Foreign Language] This is Charles Zhou from UBS. So first of all, congratulations to your very good results. It's also a strong beat to the market consensus. So I have two questions. So my first question is about the Airstar Bank. Could you please share what investment have you made since Futu acquired 44% equity stakes in Airstar Bank, I think, last June? And also, how do you see the Airstar Bank's strategic role within Futu business in terms of short-term, medium-term and also long-term perspective?

My second question is regarding the regional mix of the client AUM net inflow. Can you maybe just give us a little bit more color about the breakdown of the regional mix? So, for example, does Hong Kong still account for over 70% and also, are we seeing like a rising share from high-net-worth clients in the third quarter?

Arthur Chen
Chief Financial Officer

[Foreign Language]

Regarding the breakdown of the net asset inflow by regions, actually, we see the percentage contributed by Hong Kong got some slightly decreased on a Q-on-Q basis, mainly due to certain overseas markets such as Singapore, Malaysia also recorded a very strong asset inflows. So proportion-wise, Hong Kong's percentage contribution was down a little bit. And regarding the client cohort, we do think -- we do see more and more high net worth clients contributions in Hong Kong. And we do think this kind of trend will remain in the next coming quarters. And we think we have a very meaningful potential in terms of further upgrading our clients' quality in Hong Kong through wealth management, et cetera?

Daniel Yuan
Chief of Staff & Head of Investor Relations

Charles, this is Daniel. I'll take your first question on Airstar Bank. First of all, to give you an update on our investment, during the third quarter, upon regulatory approval and the discussion between the shareholders, we have increased our stake in Airstar Bank to 68.4%, thereby becoming the controlling shareholder of Airstar Bank. So in the short term, we'll continue to focus on improving the customer experience through enriching products and capabilities. And we believe that there is a lot of integration opportunities between the banking business and the brokerage business.

And in the long term, we believe that the banking business can help Futu increase client stickiness and to improve clients' wallet share and will enable clients to complete fund deposits, investments, lending and consumption. We can satisfy all these various financial needs within Futu's ecosystem, and we can continue to enhance our clients -- our brand perception of Futu as a one-stop financial services platform. And so far, Futu is the only online brokerage platform in Hong Kong that has integrated digital banking capabilities. And we believe the scarcity of that license and the diversity of products and services we can offer under this license will continue to widen our competitive moat.

And after this round of capital injection, Airstar Bank will be consolidated into Futu's financial statements. In the next 2 to 3 years, we'll still be in an investment mode for Airstar Bank. But we believe that as Futu's client quality improve across various markets and as more markets become profitable and play out that operating leverage, the drag of Airstar Bank's loss to Futu's overall P&L will be limited. And after the capital injection, Futu and Xiaomi Group will continue to work very closely and to take advantage each other's resources in their respective ecosystems to operate this bank together.

Your next question comes from the line of Chiyao Huang from Morgan Stanley.

Chiyao Huang
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

[Foreign Language]

So I have two questions. One is about the product pipeline from crypto and tokenization in the next 1 or 2 quarters? And then maybe a bit longer term, what kind of value proposition do we try to achieve on tokenization to our clients? And second question is about whether management have any plan on M&A in the crypto space to accelerate the capability building? And what kind of capability of crypto are we looking to build in the near term?

Arthur Chen
Chief Financial Officer

[Foreign Language]

Regarding your two questions about the crypto. Number one, for the product -- new product pipelines and also tokenization, we do have a lot of preparations and internal discussions, even some layout of certain products in that connections. But as you can understand, tokenization is a very new concept to the market nowadays and subject to different regulatory regimes examinations. So it is very difficult for us to lay out a very clear road map for the product launch, given that a lot of factors will be regulatory dependent. And regarding the M&A in the crypto side, definitely, we are very open in this direction, given the crypto is a very strategical important considerations in our business direction down the road. So definitely, we will keep these options open afterwards.

Your next question comes from the line of Leon QI from CLSA.

Leon QI

This is Leon QI from CLSA. I have two questions today. Firstly, we are very glad to see that Hong Kong for the fourth consecutive quarter has led new client additions. I'm just interested in the client profile of our new customers being acquired in Hong Kong for the past quarter and actually for the past 4 quarters in general, given Hong Kong's equity market started to become quite active since around 4 quarters ago. If there are any meaningful differences in terms of these new customers in Hong Kong in terms of average AUM, ages, trading velocity, the products they are buying, if there are any notable differences for these new clients compared with our existing Hong Kong customers, most of which were acquired during probably the bull market a few years ago? So that's the first question on Hong Kong new customer profile.

And second question, I'm interested in the gross margin trend in markets outside Hong Kong. I'm very -- we are very pleasantly surprised to see gross margin disclosed in the third quarter was very strong. And given we also have very good AUM growth in markets like Singapore and a lot of new clients in Malaysia, I presume the economy of scale is kicking in very rapidly. If possible, if management can share with us some gross margin trend in Singapore and Malaysia, where are the margin in these markets standing in now?

Daniel Yuan
Chief of Staff & Head of Investor Relations

[Foreign Language]

Leon, thank you for these two questions. This is Daniel. I'll take these two questions. First of all, regarding our Hong Kong business and in fact, in the third quarter, we have seen continued upward trajectory in average client assets of our new clients. And that coupled with the continuous net asset inflow, very robust net asset inflow from our existing clients led to a double-digit sequential growth in average client assets in Hong Kong. And I think that is representative of what happened in the past couple of quarters. As we continue to enhance our brand image, I think we can continue to attract more and more high-quality clients, and there will be more clients that are inclined to do one-stop asset allocation within Futu's platform.

And in terms of these clients' behavior, trading behavior specifically, I think that's very much market-driven. As you know, in terms of our total trading volume in the past year or so, it's mostly kind of U.S. stocks. But in Q3 this year, as the Hong Kong equities market outperformed, a lot of our clients quickly flocked to Hong Kong equities and engaged quite actively. So I think this is very much driven by the performance and the relative outperformance of different equity markets. We think this is more cyclical than structural in terms of clients' trading behavior.

And to your second question, yes, we think that online brokerage business inherently has huge operating leverage. But on the gross margin level, it's been very healthy across all of our markets because it mostly relates to trading and our trading product and margin product all have very high margins, so the operating leverage mostly kicks in from the operating expenses. And as we continue to scale in a lot of these international markets, we have seen a very rapid expansion in operating leverage. And maybe to give you some numbers on our Singapore business, for a couple of consecutive months, we have seen our -- the operating margin in our Singapore business consistently topped 60% and is still expanding. I think that really speaks to the strong operating leverage in our business model.
