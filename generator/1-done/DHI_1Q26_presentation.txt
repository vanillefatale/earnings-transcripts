Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the First Quarter 2026 Earnings Conference Call for D.R. Horton, America's Builder. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded.

I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Senior Vice President of Communications for D.R. Horton.

Jessica, please go ahead.

Jessica Hansen

Thank you. Sorry. It would help if I took myself off mute. Thank you, Paul, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026.

Before we get started, today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K, which is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

This morning's earnings release and our supplemental data presentation can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-Q later this week. After this call, we will also post our updated investor presentation to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference.

Now I will turn the call over to Paul Romanowski, our President and CEO.

Paul Romanowski
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team had a solid start to fiscal 2026 with consolidated pretax income of $798 million on $6.9 billion of revenues and a pretax profit margin of 11.6%.

New home demand remains impacted by affordability constraints and cautious consumer sentiment; however, our teams continue to respond to current market conditions with discipline. We exceeded the high end of our revenue and closings guidance, achieved a home sales gross margin within our expected range, and our net sales orders increased 3% compared to the prior year quarter, demonstrating our ability to balance pace, price and incentives to drive incremental sales and maximize returns.

We are focused on capital efficiency to generate strong operating cash flows and deliver compelling returns to our shareholders. Over the past 12 months, we have generated $3.6 billion of cash from operations, and we have returned $4.4 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. For the trailing 12 months ended December 31, our homebuilding pretax return on inventory was 18.6%, while our consolidated returns on equity and assets were 13.7% and 9.4%. Our return on assets ranks in the top 20% of all S&P 500 companies for the past 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, demonstrating that our disciplined returns-focused operating model produces sustainable results and positions us well for continued value creation.

We increased our sales incentives during the first quarter, and we expect incentives to remain elevated in fiscal 2026 with a level dependent on demand, changes in mortgage interest rates and overall market conditions. We work every day to use our industry-leading platform, unmatched scale, efficient operations and experienced employees to bring homeownership opportunities at affordable price points to more Americans. 64% of our mortgage company's closings this quarter were to first-time homebuyers. We will continue to tailor our product offerings, sales incentives and number of homes in inventory based on demand in each of our markets to maximize returns.

Michael Murray
Executive VP & COO

Earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 were $2.03 per diluted share, compared to $2.61 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $595 million on consolidated revenues of $6.9 billion. Our first quarter home sales revenues were $6.5 billion on 17,818 homes closed, compared to $7.1 billion on 19,059 homes closed in the prior year quarter.

Our average closing price for the quarter was $365,500, flat sequentially and down 3% year-over-year. Our average sales price on homes closed is lower than the average sales price of new homes in the United States by roughly $135,000, or almost 30%. Additionally, the median sales price of our homes is $70,000 lower than the median price of an existing home.

Bill Wheat
Executive VP & CFO

For the first quarter, our net sales orders increased 3% from the prior year quarter to 18,300 homes, while order value remained unchanged at $6.7 billion. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 18%, consistent with the prior year quarter and down from 20% sequentially. Our average number of active selling communities was up 2% sequentially and up 12% year-over-year. The average price of net sales orders in the first quarter was $364,000, which was flat sequentially and down 2% from the prior year quarter.

Jessica?

Jessica Hansen
Senior VP of Communications & People and Head of Investor Relations

Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the first quarter was 20.4%, up 40 basis points sequentially from the September quarter, entirely due to a recovery of prior period warranty costs received during the quarter. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues were flat sequentially, while stick and brick costs were down roughly 1% and lot costs increased 2%. Excluding the 40 basis point benefit in our gross margin this quarter from the recovery of prior warranty costs, our home sales gross margin would have been 20%.

Additionally, incentives increased as we moved throughout the quarter, so we expect our home sales gross margin to be lower in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Our incentive levels and home sales gross margin for the remainder of the year will be dependent on the strength of demand, changes in mortgage interest rates and other market conditions.

Bill?

Bill Wheat
Executive VP & CFO

Our first quarter homebuilding SG&A expenses decreased 1% from last year, and homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 9.7%, up from 8.9% in the prior year quarter. The increase in our SG&A expense ratio was primarily due to our lower home closings volume as compared to the prior year quarter. We continue to manage our platform with discipline and are focused on gaining market share efficiently while driving operating leverage over time.

Paul?

Paul Romanowski
President, CEO & Director

We started 18,500 homes in the December quarter, up 27% sequentially from the fourth quarter, and we expect our starts in the second quarter to be higher than the first quarter. We ended the quarter with 30,400 homes in inventory, of which 20,000 were unsold. 7,300 of our unsold homes at quarter end were completed, down 2,000 homes from September. 900 of our unsold homes have been completed for greater than 6 months.

For homes we closed in the first quarter, our median cycle time measured from home start to home close decreased 2 weeks from a year ago. Our improved cycle times enable us to hold fewer homes in inventory and turn our housing inventory more efficiently. We will continue to manage our homes and inventory and starts pace based on market conditions.

Mike?

Michael Murray
Executive VP & COO

Our homebuilding lot position at December 31 consists of approximately 590,500 lots, of which 25% were owned and 75% were controlled through purchase contracts. We are actively managing our investments in lots, land and development based on current market conditions. We remain focused on our relationships with land developers across the country to allow us to build more homes on lots developed by others, which enhances our capital efficiency, returns and operational flexibility.

Of the homes we closed this quarter, 67% were on a lot developed by either Forestar or a third party, up from 65% in the prior year quarter. Our first quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $2 billion, of which $1.3 billion was for finished lots, $610 million was for land development and $80 million was for land acquisition.

Paul?

Paul Romanowski
President, CEO & Director

In the first quarter, our rental operations generated $110 million of revenues from the sale of 397 single-family rental homes. Our rental property inventory at December 31 was $2.9 billion, which consisted of $2.5 billion of multifamily rental properties and $356 million of single-family rental properties. We remain focused on improving the capital efficiency and returns of our rental operations.

As for our financial services operations, pretax income for the first quarter was $58 million on $185 million of revenues, resulting in a pretax profit margin of 31.4%.

Mike?

Michael Murray
Executive VP & COO

Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company, reported revenues for the first quarter of $273 million on 1,944 lots sold with pretax income of $21 million. Forestar's owned and controlled lot position at December 31 was 101,000 lots. 62% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton. $180 million of our finished lots purchased in the first quarter were from Forestar.

Forestar's strong, separately capitalized balance sheet, national operating platform and lot supply position them well to provide essential finished lots to the homebuilding industry and aggregate significant market share over the next several years.

Bill?

Bill Wheat
Executive VP & CFO

Our capital allocation strategy is disciplined and balanced to support an operating platform that produces attractive returns and substantial operating cash flows. We have a strong balance sheet with low leverage and healthy liquidity, which provides us with significant financial flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions and opportunities. During the first 3 months of the year, homebuilding cash provided by operations was $498 million and consolidated cash provided by operations was $854 million.

During the first quarter, we repurchased 4.4 million shares of common stock for $670 million, and our outstanding share count is down 9% from a year ago. We also paid cash dividends of $0.45 per share, totaling $132 million, and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level to be paid in February. At quarter end, our stockholders' equity was $24 billion, down 4% from a year ago, and book value per share was $82.60, up 5% from a year ago.

By December 31, we had $6.6 billion of consolidated liquidity, consisting of $2.5 billion of cash and $4.1 billion of available capacity on our credit facilities. Debt at the end of the quarter totaled $5.5 billion, and we have $600 million of homebuilding senior notes maturing in the next 12 months. Our consolidated leverage at December 31 was 18.8%, and we plan to maintain our leverage around 20% over the long term.

Jessica Hansen
Senior VP of Communications & People and Head of Investor Relations

Looking forward to the second quarter, we currently expect to generate consolidated revenues in the range of $7.3 billion to $7.8 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 19,700 to 20,200 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin for the second quarter to be in the range of 19% to 19.5% and our consolidated pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.6% to 11.1%.

For the full year of fiscal 2026, we still expect to generate consolidated revenues of approximately $33.5 billion to $35 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 86,000 to 88,000 homes. We continue to forecast an income tax rate for fiscal 2026 of approximately 24.5%, operating cash flow of at least $3 billion, common stock repurchases of approximately $2.5 billion and dividend payments of around $500 million.

Paul?

Paul Romanowski
President, CEO & Director

In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and focus on delivering quality homes at affordable price points. All of these are key components of our operating platform that support our ability to aggregate market share, generate substantial operating cash flows and return capital to shareholders.

We recognize the current volatility and uncertainty in the economy, and we'll continue to adjust to market conditions in a disciplined manner to enhance the long-term value of our company. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton family of employees, land developers, trade partners, vendors and real estate agents for your continued efforts and hard work. Let's continue working to improve our operations and provide homeownership opportunities to more individuals and families during 2026.

This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.
