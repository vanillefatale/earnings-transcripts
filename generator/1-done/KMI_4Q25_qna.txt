Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions] Our first caller is Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Look, if I can kick it off more on the data center front. You guys talk about the 70% number with respect to where you have exposure and aligned with data center opportunities. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing actively on that front? Obviously, we saw the FTC announcement here, perhaps that speaks to that a little bit. But how do you think about that regionally in terms of further data points we should be seeing through the course of the year? And I've got a quick follow-up.

Kimberly Dang
CEO & Director

Okay. I'm not exactly sure about the 70%. But if you look at our $10 billion backlog, about 60% of our backlog is associated with power projects. That's not just data center, that's anything associated with power. And if you think about the opportunities on the power side, I think a great example is if you look in the state of Georgia, where Georgia Power, recently, I think the end of November filed a revised IRP. And they're projecting 53 gigawatts of power demand between now and the early 2030s.

And so from a gas perspective, if that was 100% gas, that would be like 10 Bcf a day, roughly, depending on the conversion metrics you use. And we expect that a significant portion of that will be gas, and that's just one utility in one state. And so what we're seeing across our network, whether that's in Georgia or South Carolina or Louisiana or Arkansas or Texas or New Mexico, Colorado, mean we are seeing similar stories just across our network. And the other thing is you look at power demand, we've got a higher power demand growth between 2025 and 2030. Wood Mac has in their most recent estimates increased theirs. And if you look at Wood Mac between 2030 and 2035, they think the power growth, at least in their projections, is greater between 2030 and 2035, than it is in their projections between '25 and '30. So this is something that is driving significant amount of projects. It's also a significant driver of the potential opportunities that we have, and we think will last for a decade.

Julien Dumoulin-Smith
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Excellent. If I can just firm up a little bit more on the SSE5 setup and timing. What are you looking to move forward on that? How are you thinking about timing? And then even more specifically, if you could speak to -- are you thinking about this as being a compression first or looping kind of project initially? And what level of signed utility load would unlock a more formal filing?

Sital Mody
VP & President of Natural Gas Pipelines

Yes, Julien, this is Sital. So look, in terms of timing, we see strong interest in the Southeast, and we continue to work with the customer base. In terms of what the final scope looks like, that all depends on final subscription. I do see it more than just compression. I think there could be some more brownfield looping. But once again, it's early. We're working through the demand dynamics with our customer base. We do see opportunity there, and it is competitive. So we will continue to report as we go along. But ultimately, the signed deal is what drives the announcement.

Our next caller is Jackie Koletas with Goldman Sachs.

Jacqueline Koletas
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

First, I just wanted to start on the next steps on the Western Gateway following the second open season launch last week. How do you think about allocating capital towards this project versus natural gas opportunity set? And how do those returns compare?

Kimberly Dang
CEO & Director

Yes. I mean on every project, we look at based on risk and return. And so I think we have a middle-of-the-road return that we expect and then we vary off that based on the stability, the duration and the creditworthiness of the cash flows. And so it's -- you've got stronger creditworthy parties and longer cash flows and take-or-pay, then you come off that return -- down from that return a little bit. And if you have those things are less and you go above that return. All these returns are significantly above our cost of capital. And so I think if we proceed on Western Gateway, we will have long-term shipper contracts there. And I expect those shipper contracts will be largely from creditworthy counterparties. And if not, we would have some credit support.

So we don't, at this point, have limited capital. I think we can easily fund this project and do all the natural gas projects that we're talking about. Another point I'd point out on Western Gateway, which is we are contributing assets to that. And so our cash contribution will be less than we're going to -- we're setting up a 50-50 joint venture with P66. It would be less than half of the cost of the overall project because we're contributing value for -- contributing assets for part of our contribution.

Jacqueline Koletas
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, leverage ended around 3.8x in the quarter. How do you think about maintaining leverage levels towards the midpoint of your long-term guide of 3.5 to 4.5x range versus leveraging up towards that high end if there are multiple CapEx opportunities?

Kimberly Dang
CEO & Director

Well, I'd say right now, what we've said is we're going to spend about $3 billion per year in CapEx. Now that won't be a perfect ground, $3 billion because you just have timing of spend, but roughly $3 billion a year. And we have the ability to fund that 100% out of cash flow. The other thing I'd point out is that as our $10 billion backlog of projects come online that our debt-to-EBITDA actually declines over time. And so that creates more balance sheet capacity. So for every 0.1x of leverage, that's $850 million of capacity. So I think we've got a ton of capacity even without leveraging up closer to the 4.5x. And I don't think we have intention of getting close to that level. So I think we've got plenty of capacities to accommodate the opportunities that we see out there.

Operator

Our next caller is Theresa Chen with Barclays.

Theresa Chen
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Kim, I hear you loud and clear on the less than 50% of capital contribution on Western Gateway because you're contributing SFPP. When we think about the net EBITDA impact to Kinder, and I'm assuming this project moves forward, how should we quantify the displacement of existing SFPP EBITDA? How much is that contributing currently?

Kimberly Dang
CEO & Director

Well, I think, 2 things. One, Theresa, I think we're really early. And so we've got to get through the open season, we've got negotiations to do with our partner on the specifics. So I think -- and so I think we've got to finalize costs, et cetera. So I think it's too early to go through that at this point.

Theresa Chen
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Understood. Maybe turning to a different portion of your liquids business. Could you provide an update on the progress of the HH conversion? And in light of recent upstream developments in the Bakken and the increasingly challenged near-term outlook for the basin, how are you thinking about the expected NGL throughput and EBITDA contribution from this project?

Kimberly Dang
CEO & Director

Sure. I mean the project is going to come on probably late first quarter, early second quarter and that's Phase 1. And then with respect to the future phases, that's something we continue to work on.

Sital Mody
VP & President of Natural Gas Pipelines

Yes. I mean, Theresa, Broadly, though, I mean, we still -- given the recent pullback, it's just a matter of time. I think our initial phase is well contracted. We see the volumes behind it. These are coming from our plants, and so we have visibility there. So I don't think, as far as Phase 1 is concerned, and that is probably on the earlier side of the time frame that Kim gave you in terms of where we come in. I think as we look to the next phase, we continue to have discussions, positive discussions with our customers. We'll monitor the overall macro situation, and we'll make the investment decision accordingly. That being said, we still have that in front of us.

Kimberly Dang
CEO & Director

Right, and I think the other thing is GORs are growing in the Bakken.

Operator

Our next caller is Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.

Michael Blum
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Yes, maybe if I could just ask maybe a different way at the same question to some degree, with Continental Resources effectively saying they're going to stop drilling in the Bakken. I'm wondering if you can talk about, at least for now, can you talk about how meaningful a customer they are, either your current business? Or where they were contemplated to be for HH and if that has an impact on the further expansion?

Kimberly Dang
CEO & Director

So yes, if you look at the EBITDA that we get from Bakken or EBDA, it's about 3% of Kinder Morgan overall. Obviously, Continental makes up a piece of that. We don't think that there's going to be any material impact from the Continental news. We think that the impact is very manageable, that's one because it's 3% of our EBITDA. But it's also because volumes came into the year a little stronger than we were expecting. And it's also because they're going to continue to complete wells through August and because they are just one of a number of customers we have up there.

Michael Blum
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. That makes sense. And then I just wanted to ask, in light of the asset sale that you did here in late 2025. Are there more noncore assets that you're actively looking to sell? And strategically, are there segments or areas of the business that you're more inclined to reduce your exposure to?

Kimberly Dang
CEO & Director

Okay. Yes. Let me talk about the EagleHawk sale first. First of all, on that, that's not an asset that we were looking or planning to sell. Our partner approached us because they were selling at least a portion of their interest and based on the price that we could achieve it made sense to sell. It's an 8.5x multiple on a nonoperated minority interest in the GMP asset. And when we looked at the reinvestment opportunity, meaning if we were buying at the price that we propose to sell and we look at the cash flows, those were going to be below our cost of capital. So -- and that included taking in into account any tax impact from the sale.

So we thought it made sense. It was a good economic decision to sell that asset and recycle that capital. And so that's generally the way that we have been approaching sales of assets, which has been more opportunistic. As we say, our assets are for sale every day at the right price. And so we want to make good economic decisions about that. We like the portfolio of assets that we have today, 60 -- it's 2/3 natural gas and 26% is products, pipelines and terminals, very similar pipeline and storage business. So similar -- and then 7% is CO2, which is a little bit different, but we get great returns on that business, and we have an expertise that a lot of people don't have. So I think we're very comfortable with the suite of assets that we have, and this was just an opportunistic sale that made sense.

Our next caller is Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.

Jeremy Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I was just curious for your thoughts, I guess, industry at large and what opportunities it could present to you down the road just if we think about Waha egress. One, we have some pretty cold weather coming up in -- during Uri, that presented opportunities for Kinder last go around. So just wondering if you could share any thoughts there.

Sital Mody
VP & President of Natural Gas Pipelines

Well, look, we -- as always here, when we look at the footprint, given our footprint, we're able to leverage basis dislocations that occurred. First and foremost, we want to serve our customers. And then to the extent that these opportunities present themselves, we've been taking a little more of a proprietary view on certain things in certain areas, strategically, small amounts. And so to the extent that, that presents itself, we'll be able to leverage that.

Kimberly Dang
CEO & Director

Yes. But I don't think -- this storm is not a Uri.

Sital Mody
VP & President of Natural Gas Pipelines

It's not a Uri.

Kimberly Dang
CEO & Director

I mean it's much shorter in duration and it's not going to be as significant. So...

Jeremy Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Understood. It seems like there might be another one on its heels. So we'll see what happens this winter again.

Kimberly Dang
CEO & Director

Generally, what I would say is that the gas transportation market is very tight. And so whenever you see dislocations in supplier demand in and around our assets, that is going to present opportunities for us. And that's part of what you saw in the fourth quarter of this year.

Sital Mody
VP & President of Natural Gas Pipelines

Yes. I mean a key component of that is storage for us, and we have a significant storage portfolio that will allow us to leverage some of that to the extent that it presents itself.

Jeremy Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And then just wanted to dial in on NGPL a little bit here, hearing more data center-driven opportunities in the Midwest, coal to gas switching as well, some of the other nat gas pipeline operators are seeing a lot of activity there. I'm just wondering if you could talk about what that could mean for Kinder -- for NGPL.

Sital Mody
VP & President of Natural Gas Pipelines

Yes. So look, we've -- we're quite a bit of -- there's significant discussions. You've been seeing some of the EBB postings we've been making out there. We've got interest along the pipeline in terms of not only just from power customers but also from organic markets that are trying to grow. Still early on some of these projects. We've got some binding commitments that we're looking to convert into full-fledged FID projects, as these develop, we'll bring them. But I mean, when you think about the corridor itself, we see a concentration up in the market area. We have some in the producing regions where folks are looking to site themselves. And so I think the opportunity set is there. It's just, once again, we're in this mode where folks are looking -- there's -- it's a competitive landscape, and so we want to make sure we secure the returns that we need to progress the projects to FID.

Our next caller is Jean Ann Salisbury with Bank of America.

Jean Ann Salisbury
BofA Securities, Research Division

You said in the prepared comments that MSX could be in service a couple of quarters early, I think. Is there any read across to a faster permitting process across the board? Or was that project specific?

Kimberly Dang
CEO & Director

No. I mean I think a couple of things on these projects. One is 871 is gone, and that happened, I don't know, 6 or 9 months ago. And that basically required us to wait 5 months between when we got our FERC certificates and when we could start construction. So that's gone. And then the FERC has acted within -- is going to act within roughly 1 year on our filing. And so previously, we've been seeing that take a little bit longer than that on big projects. And so the fact that the FERC process only took 12 months and we don't have 871 is speeding up our in-service on MSX from, call, the fourth quarter of '28 to the second quarter of '28.

Jean Ann Salisbury
BofA Securities, Research Division

Great. That's very clear. And then one of your peers took an equity stake in a U.S. LNG terminal a few months ago. Is that something that KMI is actively looking at or would have interest in, especially, I guess, if you could back to back it with another counterparty to make it take-or-pay equivalent?

Kimberly Dang
CEO & Director

To make it -- well, I'll say a couple of things on that. Generally, what we've seen on the LNG front is the returns haven't been where we needed them to be to make those investments. And it's not something that we are accustomed to building. We do a small one, obviously, at Elba, but that was a relatively small facility. And so I think in general, what you should expect from us is that we are kind of sticking to our knitting, we're staying in our lane. We are serving those LNG -- that LNG demand through our pipelines. And right now, we serve 40% of that demand. As Rich said, that demand is expected to grow significantly, and we expect to get our fair share of that future demand, and that's driving very nice project opportunities for us. So I'm not saying we would never step out. It's just there hasn't been the opportunity where we thought the risk return profile was appropriate. And we haven't wanted to build these on our own.

Richard Kinder
Executive Chairman of the Board

I think another thing we like on a risk-return basis is the fact that both on the LNG terminal side for feed gas and on the service to -- for electric generation purposes, we have, in general, take-or-pay contracts with utility grade -- investment-grade utilities. And that, we think, is a very good way to look at the risk that we are taking. And we think that minimizes any risk that we have as opposed to contracting directly with AI developers, for example.

Our next caller is Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.

Keith Stanley
Wolfe Research, LLC

You updated the messaging on CapEx to at least $3 billion a year of growth CapEx for the next few years, up from $2.5 billion. Wanted to clarify, is that solely based on the sanctioned project backlog today? So if you keep FID-ing new projects and the backlog grows, CapEx could be above $3 billion a year for the next few years? Or is that already reflecting your best estimate over the next few years?

Kimberly Dang
CEO & Director

I'd say it's largely based on the $10 billion approved project backlog, but there is some view, there is a small portion that is based on getting some of the $10 billion in the opportunity set. So -- and look, I think that we updated it from $2.5 billion to $3 billion, given the $10 billion, given we continue to add to the backlog even after putting projects in service. So this year, when we were putting all those projects in service at the beginning of the year, we thought it might come down. It's continued to increase natural gas demand, we continue to see it grow between '25 and '30, but also beyond that. And so there may be the opportunity to extend that further, but we're not ready to do that -- or make it higher, but we're not ready to do that at this point in time.

Keith Stanley
Wolfe Research, LLC

Got it. Second question, just wanted to follow up on the earlier one on Mississippi Crossing. So if you're 6 months early on that project and on -- potentially on some of the other bigger ones given the regulatory environment. Would your contracts kick in and you'd have pretty close to a full financial contribution right away at that earlier date? Or is that not the case?

Kimberly Dang
CEO & Director

It's a project-by-project analysis. In this case, the answer is no, the customers don't have to take it at that point in time. They can. I mean, they can elect to take it, but they don't have to. And I would say that being early on the regulatory front does not directly translate into day for day on the in-service. It's going to depend on the projects because once you move back that regulatory, once you get sooner approval from a regulatory perspective, you have to think about when you're getting pipe and when you're getting compression. And so, for example, we haven't seen that translate into much of an earlier date on South System 4 at this point in time. So it's project by project. But if our customers don't want that capacity, it will be available for us to use during that time.

Sital Mody
VP & President of Natural Gas Pipelines

And given the macro environment, Keith, I mean, you just think about the demand profiles that are coming our way, it's just -- you look at that as an opportunity to sell in the secondary markets.

Our next call is Manav Gupta with UBS.

Manav Gupta
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Firstly, congrats on all the upgrades from rating agencies, reflects the strong quality of the management and execution. I wanted to ask you about the Florida Gas Transmission projects, both the projects. How did these come about? Can you give us more details? And then the last one year, what you have seen is you announced the project and then end up upsizing it. So if you could talk about the possibility of some upsizing here for these projects.

Sital Mody
VP & President of Natural Gas Pipelines

So Manav, this is Sital. So just in terms of the project itself, as you know, we're not the operator. Energy Transfer is the operator. So we'll let them talk about how it came about on the call. We've been working with them closely. Thematically, it's the same themes we've been talking about in the Southeast. We see that as a growth area, just broadly. And this is just another example of us getting incremental infrastructure to an area where there is significant growth. There's also a resiliency component there with the 2 projects. We think it makes sense in terms of whether or not the project gets upsized. We're in the process of having an open season right now. That open season closes here, I think, Feb 5, if I'm not mistaken. And based on the interest there, is it possible to upsize? Yes, if there's a demand for it.

Kimberly Dang
CEO & Director

Yes. I'd say both those projects are backed by long-term contracts with creditworthy counterparties. And so I mean, they are right down [Technical Difficulty].

Manav Gupta
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Perfect. And my quick follow-up here is, at the start of the call, you mentioned that the 4Q turned out to be stronger than what you thought when you announced your 3Q results. So help us understand some of those tailwinds which help you drive the beat in 4Q? And are those still persistent out there? So should 1Q also turn out pretty strong, if you could talk about that.

Kimberly Dang
CEO & Director

Sure. So I mean, it was across the gas network. So it was our intrastate business, it was our interstate pipes and it was our gathering assets. And so as we said before, when you [Technical Difficulty] and this goes more to the outperformance on the intrastate.

Operator

This is the operator, please standby. And speakers, please go ahead. The next question comes from Jason Gabel.

Jason Gabelman
TD Cowen, Research Division

It's Jason Gabelman from TD Cowen. Hopefully, the storm isn't hitting you too hard down there. Maybe to start and to help everyone out, maybe we could just replay Manav's question because I was interested in the answer to it. I didn't quite hear. So just wondering what drove the earnings upside on the natural gas segment in 4Q. It sounded like some of it was driven by pull from LNG plants. So did some of these plants start up earlier than you had expected in the plan? Or were there other factors at play?

Kimberly Dang
CEO & Director

I mean, it was -- look, it was across the entire gas business. So it was a lot in our Texas intrastate market. It was in the Eagle Ford and the Haynesville on our gathering assets. And then it was also on the interstate markets more so in the Northeast than other areas. And so it's a function of having a very tight pipeline and storage network and that's going to create opportunities when you have supply or demand dislocations that could be weather, that could be LNG coming on or off, it could be a variety of factors, but that leads to volatility and upside for us. And there is the potential for that to happen again in 2026.

Jason Gabelman
TD Cowen, Research Division

Great. And my follow-up maybe staying on the topic of LNG. It seems like the market is facing this upcoming global supply glut and maybe you get a bit of a slowdown in the pace of new liquefaction project sanctions here in the U.S. Gulf Coast. So just wondering how much of that project backlog, if any, is tied to servicing incremental projects? And I guess it's not the project backlog. It is the shadow project backlog and projects -- LNG projects that are associated with that shadow backlog.

Kimberly Dang
CEO & Director

Yes. So a couple of things. I'd reiterate the point Rich made a minute ago, which is -- the -- we have long-term take-or-pay contracts with these LNG facilities. And so those typically are 20- to 25-year contracts, and they pay whether they use that capacity or not. In our current backlog, about 12% of the $10 billion actual approved project backlog -- 12% of the shadow backlog is associated with LNG. So it's not a huge percentage. I think a lot of the shadow backlog, again, is going to be more on the power front. But the other thing I'd say is that when you look at these LNG projects, it's not always about adding a new facility. A lot of times, it's about an existing facility has some capacity and they want to reach further back to get more competitive supply. So to have incremental project, you don't have to have a new facility come online. It could be a need from an existing facility to try to get more competitive supply.

Operator

And at this time, we are showing no further questions.
