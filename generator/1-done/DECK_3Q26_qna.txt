Your first question comes from the line of Jay Sole of UBS Financial.

Jay Sole
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Stefano, it sounds like HOKA really had a terrific quarter. It sounds like that you've seen an acceleration in the business from last quarter to this quarter. Can you maybe just dive into what has changed? What has driven the improvement? You talked a lot about product. I think you mentioned the Gaviota, the Arahi. There's a lot of newness out there. You mentioned the Cielo, the Mach, Stinson, some of these other things that have popped up. Is it product? Is it marketing? Is it just maintaining a very strong full price sell-through mentality? Maybe just explain to us what has gotten better? And do you see it as sustainable going forward?

Stefano Caroti
CEO, President & Director

Yes. First of all, I do see it sustainable going forward. I think we had a few learnings last year. We decided to space out key franchise launches with tightened inventories of outgoing styles, and we better leverage our DTC channel to move closeouts in a controlled manner. We see opportunity across every region every channel in every category of our business this year. So I feel confident that this trajectory will continue.

Steve Fasching
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I think, Jay, just to add on to that, too. I think what's also encouraging in some of where we're seeing acceleration is with some of the new product that we introduced last year, performing very well with consumers. So recall that we had some of our big franchise updates last year, early last year, and we've continued to see consumers engage with those updates quite a bit.

Stefano Caroti
CEO, President & Director

Yes. And as you mentioned, Jay, Gaviota 5 is off to a great start on the back of a successful Arahi introduction. Now we're a meaningful player in the stability category. Transport 2, again, launched last week, but off to a good start. Cielo X1 3.0, our fastest and lightest shoe to date, launched today, and it's already our best-selling style online. So I feel very good about the product pipeline coming.

Jay Sole
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Got it. Maybe if I can just follow up on that. You talked about lifestyle in your prepared remarks. I think you mentioned you're going to do a new ad campaign. Can you talk a little bit more about where lifestyle is today, what your projection is for how that business will develop? And with all the new stuff that you're talking about, Machs, Speedgoats, Cielo, Gaviota, Arahi, Stinson and Transport, I mean, how much is the diversification of the product line really changed the mix of the business from just Bondi and Clifton? Can you give us a sense of that as well? Those are really the 2 questions.

Stefano Caroti
CEO, President & Director

That is really one of our aims. We have boosted capabilities, as you know, across innovation, design, color and lifestyle. And this is helping us more effectively segment the marketplace and also differentiate DTC. Performance, however, remains at the core of what the brand is. And as you know, the lifestyle consumer has adopted many performance styles. At the same time, we do view this category as a huge opportunity for the brand. And I'm really encouraged by what is coming. Early reads on some of the products we launched in Q4 is very positive. [ Stinson ] 7, Bondi Mary Jane, Speed loafer are performing very well. And as I look ahead, the team has done a great job in clarifying the line architecture, simplifying designs and also hit more commercial price points. So I do believe that we have a good runway also in lifestyle going forward.

Your next question comes from the line of Peter McGoldrick of Stifel.

Peter McGoldrick
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I was interested in the channel strategy for the UGG brand. It's encouraging to see both channels grow in tandem in the key sell-through quarter. Given the shift in strategy to prioritize retail partner in-stocks for fiscal '26, I'm curious how we should think of your plans to manage the UGG brand in fiscal '27 on a wholesale versus DTC basis.

Stefano Caroti
CEO, President & Director

Potential for the UGG brand across all channels. all regions and all categories. So you should continue to see a balanced growth in the UGG portfolio. We're very happy with what the brand has delivered in terms of newness. Our 365 offering has been very well received. Our -- we're now playing legitimately in the sneaker category with the Lowmel. And our classic products continue to perform very well. So you should expect continued segmentation of the marketplace, continued differentiation and growth across all channels, markets and categories.

Steve Fasching
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And I think, Peter, also, as you looked at this year in terms of channel strategy, I think the important thing to recall is a couple of things. that impacted timing, especially around the wholesale channel distribution. So recall, in Europe, we had a distribution center move. So we were shipping earlier product to avoid disruption on some of that business logistics change in Europe. And then I think with the strong demand that we saw coming out of last year, we saw strong wholesale orders and then reorders. And so much of those customers wanted product earlier this year. That's why you were seeing a shift of the wholesale growth more to the first half of the year.

And that was really more of an indication of the strength of the demand of the UGG brand coming up to our biggest season. And so what that allowed us to do was shift more focus to DTC. So very encouraging to see how that channel played out during the course of the year because, again, we're not managing just every quarter. We're managing the business for the long run and for the season. So what's very encouraging is how well the season did. And I think some of the dynamics that you saw play out between quarters was just a way of managing the increasing demand that we're seeing for the brand.

Peter McGoldrick
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I appreciate that. And Steve, a follow-up for you on DTC performance. Nice to see the consolidated inflection. I'm curious how we should consider this moving forward? It seems like you've got some nice structural contributors from HOKA membership, and then we're looking at easier comparisons. Can you help us think about assumptions for traffic, conversion, ticket and basket embedded in the outlook?

Steve Fasching
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So we continue to see improvements. So I think encouraged with what we saw, consistent with what we've been saying for the past few quarters in terms of an expectation that we would see momentum and improvements in the DTC performance. You're seeing that continue in the current quarter that we just reported, and we're continuing to look for improvements going forward. So I think encouraged with everything that we've said. I think the other highlight was some of the things that we talked about in prepared remarks, which improved DTC and I think importantly, drove gross margin improvement on the HOKA brand, right? So it shows that the work that we're doing to improve the business, draw more full-priced consumers in and bring them through the DTC channel is working, and we'll continue to build on that.

Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Vasilescu of BNP Paribas.

Laurent Vasilescu
BNP Paribas, Research Division

I wanted to follow up on Peter's Steve. The HOKA guide of 13% to 14%, this is despite a very, very easy compare. Any considerations there on that front? Is it just conservatism? I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks, maybe with Stefano, going forward, there's fluctuations in channel growth that may make strategic decisions. Can you maybe unpack a little bit more for the audience?

Steve Fasching
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, sure. I'll start on that. I think the point there, right, is how we're managing both our brands for long-term sustainable growth, right? And so we're not going to get hung up on kind of quarterly compares if we believe it's kind of detrimental to the brand. So if we look at what happened this year, right, as I talked about with Peter's question in terms of how we were flowing inventory into the channel, we're making sure that we have the appropriate amount of inventory with the demand that we're seeing, but also setting up an opportunity to continue to grow our DTC, right, with a long-term target of improving the proportion of our DTC business overall, which will take several years. It's an important marketplace management setup of how you get there.

And I think that's what you're seeing play out this year is a focus on balancing some of that wholesale demand out, fulfilling it a little bit earlier, placing then a little bit more emphasis on DTC growth as we get into the selling or bigger selling seasons. And that works, right? And so as we look going forward, it's about maintaining that. One of the positive things, I think, that we see is when we have these strong quarters, it's a signal of the consumer demand that's out there, right? And the demand for our brands is very strong. What it also does is it encourages some wholesale accounts to order bigger and order earlier, and we'll take advantage of that. And that's where that will play out.

But again, we have a very keen focus on how we continue to develop our DTC business. You've seen some of the improvements that we've made and how that's driving more consumer engagement and more full-price consumer engagement for us.

Laurent Vasilescu
BNP Paribas, Research Division

Very, very helpful. And then as a follow-up second question here. I think on the last call, it was noted that you have strong spring/summer order for HOKA. I think today, I think you talked about meaningful growth. Curious to know what your order books look like. If you can maybe unpack that a little bit more in terms of dimension, like in terms of how do we think about the growth rates there because you mentioned meaningful growth. And did I hear this correctly, Steve, that you anticipate UGG to grow next year for fiscal '27? Was that in the prepared remarks?

Steve Fasching
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. I'll take a shot at the first one, and then Stefano, you can jump in. Yes, we're anticipating growth for UGG in FY '27. I think through the quarter that we just delivered is a demonstration of how well the UGG brand resonates with consumers across the globe, including the U.S. So even as we continue to get bigger, the demand continues to grow for this brand. And so yes, we see UGG continuing to grow in FY '27.

Stefano Caroti
CEO, President & Director

Yes. And to the order book, we're not going to provide today fiscal '27 guidance, but I'm pleased with how the order books are coming in for both brands, especially for HOKA, given the fact that HOKA books a bit early fall than UGG does. Typically, wholesalers wait for the holiday season to end given how big that season is for UGG to place orders in early spring. And -- but we have visibility through the first 3 quarters of next year, and we're very encouraged by how the order book is developing globally.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez of Citi.

Paul Lejuez
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Curious within the HOKA wholesale business, if you can talk about sell-through by channel, specialty running, sporting goods, athletic specialty, what you saw this quarter? And I'm curious if you've seen any change quarter-to-date.

Stefano Caroti
CEO, President & Director

No major changes. Throughout the fall season, sell-through continued to outpace sell-in, which is a good indicator of brand health in the marketplace. All our major introductions for the season and the color updates on our 2 biggest franchise continue to perform well. In the athletic specialty space, our performance product has actually outperformed our lifestyle product. But in one of the 2 leading athletic specialty retailers for the month of December, we're the #2 brand in the doors we're in. So the brand is performing well really across channels.

Paul Lejuez
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Can you talk about the sell-through at the sporting goods channel as well?

Stefano Caroti
CEO, President & Director

Very similar -- my comment was for the -- for all channels. So generally speaking, yes, we continue to perform well across all channels, across every market.

Paul Lejuez
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then just one follow-up. I think last quarter, you had some cautionary comments about the U.S. consumer. Just curious about your outlook for the consumer, just given that we've just got through the holiday season, how that might influence or inform how you're thinking about growth for each brand in the U.S. next year.

Stefano Caroti
CEO, President & Director

Yes, that's fair. We've been cautious about the economy and the consumer, but never about our brands. So the brands did show up, and this increases our optimism going into next year.

Steve Fasching
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I think, Paul, just on that, I think as Stefano said, our comments in prior quarters more has been just watching especially the U.S. consumer as we've seen very strong growth internationally. We knew our brands are well positioned. And I think we even said that on the call last quarter, which was, hey, if the consumer shows up, we expect our brands to do well. And that's exactly what happened. So even in the current environment, I think we see consumers choosing and buying the brands that they want.

And again, with our performance, this is just an indication of the resonance that our brand has with consumers. And so that really gives us confidence going into next year.

Your next question comes from the line of Sam Poser of Williams Trading.

Samuel Poser
Williams Trading, LLC, Research Division

Aaron, I'm sorry, we can't go through our normal stuff. We already got all the info. Can you hear me?

Steve Fasching
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, we can hear you.

Samuel Poser
Williams Trading, LLC, Research Division

Okay. All right. A couple of questions. Can you give us some idea of how the domestic DTC business was for HOKA and for UGG?

Stefano Caroti
CEO, President & Director

Both UGG and HOKA performed well indeed.

Steve Fasching
Chief Financial Officer

And I think continuing -- yes, continuing to grow positively inflecting, right, which is kind of what we said on the call. So again, as we said at the beginning of last year, we expected sequential improvement. We've delivered sequential improvement, and we've positively inflected in the U.S.

Samuel Poser
Williams Trading, LLC, Research Division

So is that -- I mean, you're up 19% with your DTC. Does that mean U.S. was up like 8% and you were -- or I mean, can you give us a little warmer? And then was the UGG DTC business up in the U.S.?

Steve Fasching
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So both were up.

Stefano Caroti
CEO, President & Director

Brands were up, yes.

Samuel Poser
Williams Trading, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then you talked about lifestyle. And then, Stefano, but you mentioned like with athletic specialty, how they were doing better with performance products. How do you define lifestyle? I mean, because a lot of product over the years has -- so the product has run over the years has just always hit the it's a gray area, what's lifestyle and what's performance sometimes based on how consumers respond. So how do you define lifestyle?

Stefano Caroti
CEO, President & Director

We define lifestyle as product created by our category, right? But to your point, we're treating performance products also in a lifestyle manner that have been adopted by our Flex specialty distribution, and those have performed very well. So...

Steve Fasching
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And I think, Sam, just on that a little bit, right? I think to your point on kind of the gray area nature is we build performance product. But clearly, we have people wearing it once they experience kind of the comfort of HOKA for lifestyle applications. So we have performance shoes that are being worn in lifestyle applications. When we talk about the further lifestyle ability, it's more around the improvement on certain styles or designs where we can further amplify our ability to get into a lifestyle category. Clearly, people are wearing -- individuals, consumers are wearing HOKA product for lifestyle. That is giving us more permission to move more aggressively into a lifestyle-defined category.

Samuel Poser
Williams Trading, LLC, Research Division

And one last thing. Back to the breakout, the regional breakout. Based on the information you gave us about DTC, that implies that 1 of the 2 brands, HOKA or UGG was down, the wholesale business was down in the quarter. Could we assume that, that was HOKA just because of the amount of Bondi that you shipped?

Steve Fasching
Chief Financial Officer

No. Yes. So just to clarify on that, no, both UGG and HOKA were up. If you'll see on the press release, part of what's driving the decline is the phaseout of the Koolaburra brand. And so that's where you're seeing decline. So if you refer back to the press release, you'll see where we've broken out kind of the 3 categories, the declines there are driven by the phaseout of Koolaburra. UGG and HOKA were all positive.

Samuel Poser
Williams Trading, LLC, Research Division

In both geographies?

Stefano Caroti
CEO, President & Director

Yes.

Your next question comes from the line of Rick Patel of Raymond James.

Rakesh Patel
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

I also have a question on HOKA U.S. DTC. So you've touched on the numbers, but can you help us understand what drove the positive inflection in Q3 relative to the first half? Because you previously alluded to consumers preferring to shop in person for new products and this weighed on D2C in the first half. So just curious what's changed in the go-to-market strategy to drive the positive outcome in Q3 as we evaluate the durability of this DTC growth.

Stefano Caroti
CEO, President & Director

One of the main reasons, Rick, has been the HOKA membership program that has helped us improve revenue per customer, units per transaction, multi-category purchases and relative to the average customer. That was one of the main reasons for our success. and the fact that there was less noise in the marketplace of outgoing styles. If you recall last year with the Bondi transition, and there was a lot of product in the marketplace. This year, the marketplace is a lot cleaner, and we benefited from it.

Steve Fasching
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And I think, Rick, to the point you made where we were saying people were finding the updates, right? People were more familiar with the updates. So as we moved into Q3, and this was part of our comment on the sequential improvements, as people became more familiar with the product having been in the market, they were responding, right, to the updates. That's to my earlier one of the questions where I talked about what's driven confidence for us is the consumer engagement with our updates. And so yes, it's Clifton, Bondis, Arahis, it's other styles, too. But that it speaks to consumers coming back to us directly through improvements through the membership program and engaging with us to buy that product. So there are a number of things there that are embedded. It's product improvement...

Stefano Caroti
CEO, President & Director

Exclusives, early drops, and that has definitely helped our DTC business.

Rakesh Patel
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Great. And then can you also help us think about the opportunity for HOKA pricing? I think the increase you took last year was a bit lower than what competitors have done. So do you see room to take pricing higher? And if so, is that a near-term event?

Stefano Caroti
CEO, President & Director

Selectively and strategically, as we've done, we have some price increases hitting the spring and some more in the fall. We typically, when we upgrade the product, we price it up. that has been our approach and has served us well so far.

Steve Fasching
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And I think the quarter demonstrates that we have more pricing power, and that's something that we can always look at.

Your last question comes from the line of Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group.

Dana Telsey
Telsey Advisory Group LLC

As you think about the DTC channel, any difference by brand of e-commerce and stores? And what are your plans for opening stores this year? And then just on the wholesale channel, any more color on any specific retailers that's been working? And did you have any exposure to SAC?

Stefano Caroti
CEO, President & Director

On the latter, no, we have little or no exposure to SAC. Both channels, retail and e-commerce performed well. And your third question was sort of related to DTC -- on wholesale. We're very happy with really the performance of the brand really across all retailers. Journeys had a good run with the brand. Foot Locker is performing well with the brand. ESG is performing well with the brand. Run specialty continues to perform well with the brand, and we are together with Brooks, #1, 2 in the run specialty channel. So generally, the brand has performed in a balanced way across the wholesale portfolio. In the U.S.

There are no further questions at this time. With that, ladies and gentlemen, concludes today's call. We thank you for participating. You may now disconnect your lines.
