[Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from David Amsellem of Piper Sandler.

David Amsellem
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

So I have one question on AUSTEDO and one on UZEDY. So helpful color on the guide, but I wanted to dig more deeply into the various pushes and pulls regarding AUSTEDO in 2026. Can you talk about net pricing dynamics and what's baked into your assumptions ex the gross to net favorability in 4Q and ex stocking? How should we be thinking about what your assumptions are regarding net pricing as we move through the year? And then how should we be thinking about what your assumptions are regarding volume growth, particularly on a per milligram basis. So that's number one.

And on UZEDY, kind of a similar question. There's a lot of volume growth, obviously, but there's obviously significant government exposure, particularly Medicaid. So how should we be thinking about net pricing there? And what kind of assumptions you baked into your UZEDY guidance?

Richard Francis
President, CEO & Director

David, thanks for the questions. So let me start with AUSTEDO. I think the main point to highlight first here is we're really pleased with the momentum we have with the TRx growth we have, with the adoption of XR and the continued growth of the milligrams, as you saw there at 19%. So the fundamentals are really strong. We see a huge opportunity to continue to grow this from a TRx point of view with the amount of patients who are still untreated. So that fundamental is really strong. I think when it comes to the pricing, I think as we communicated last year, our aim has always been to make sure we get value and access.

And so we've been very diligent about that for this year. And so obviously, it has got more competitive, but we've taken a very disciplined approach to that. And so I think we've maintained that value and access. So I don't think you could think of that as anything that's -- anything of any significance there. And I think the thing to think about with AUSTEDO is what we've finished 2025 with some really strong growth, both on our top line as well as on our milligrams and TRx. And as I said, if you back out that inventory build and the gross to net is still very strong performance.

And so if you look at how we're performing across this range, I think we have a very strong range here. It does take into account some expectation that there may be some destocking in Q4 in 2026, but we'll see how that plays out. But probably the final thing I'll say on AUSTEDO, just to help give some clarity. If you do look at the range we've got and you back out the inventory build that we had in Q4, the growth of the brand is about -- the range is from 11% to 18%. So very strong growth on what is a lot bigger base. So I think that helps answer your question on AUSTEDO.

On UZEDY, then as you've seen, very strong growth on UZEDY, really strong growth on TRx and continued really good change in the dynamics of this market that shows the quality of the product. But to your question, I think it's always important to understand that we have Medicaid and Medicare. And so we have that mix. And obviously, we know one is more profitable than the other. And how that mix plays out we've taken into account with our guidance and our range. But we see this product continued momentum, particularly as you look at the TRx being so high. So I think this product, we have a lot of enthusiasm around, but that's the fundamentals around the pricing. We factored them in, and it really comes down to those 2 channels. Thanks for the question, David.

Our next question comes from Louise Chen of Scotiabank.

Louise Chen
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. So my first question was, I wanted to ask you where you see the greatest disconnect between what you're excited about in your pipeline and what the Street is really missing on those products? And then second one, just a follow-up on AUSTEDO, I wanted to ask you how we should think about modeling 2027 in light of IRA and any other pushes and pulls you see here?

Richard Francis
President, CEO & Director

Okay. Thanks for the questions there. So the pipeline, I'll probably tag team this a bit with Eric. What -- look, I'll never say anybody is missing anything because everybody is very experienced in this business. I do think that our pipeline has come along very fast, think of fast side, maybe that's caught people unaware. But I think the quality of our antibodies, the quality of anti-TL1, the quality of duvakitug, I think, will show out in the data. So I think probably what's going to happen, I'd anticipate is as we turn over these cards and we see the data, then I think Teva will get recognized for what is a world-class pipeline. But it's probably a bit surprising for people to see just the quality of the pipeline that's emerged in such a short space of time. But maybe I'll hand it to Eric to give his view on that.

Eric Hughes
Executive VP of Global R&D and Chief Medical Officer

Yes. Thank you, Richard, and thank you, Louise, for the question. I would emphasize something Richard said. I think the speed at which we turn around the innovative portfolio is quite honestly caught people by surprise. We've turned on a brand-new biologic for duvakitug, which is probably the best-in-class product for TL1A. We've launched or we will launch, hopefully, olanzapine LAI this year. But don't take our word for it. We've had external validation on 4 of these 5 programs. Olanzapine LAI got Royalty Pharma funding. Duvakitug was partnered with Sanofi, who saw the value.

The DARI program was acknowledged by Abingworth. The anti-IL-15 program was recently acknowledged again by Royalty Pharma. And even emrusolmin, we've received Fast Track designation and an orphan designation. So across the entire innovative pipeline, we've accelerated them, I think, a little bit to the surprise of investors. But just look at the external validation that we've had in the pipeline and take that into consideration of your valuation.

Richard Francis
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Eric. And then moving on to your final question about -- I think it was sort of asking for guidance on AUSTEDO in 2027, which I'm not going to give. Obviously, we've said we're going to do $2.5 billion for AUSTEDO in 2027. We remain very committed to that. As you see in our range that we have announced today, there's a potential that we will hit $2.5 billion in 2026. So we'll have to see how this plays out. I think the most important thing for AUSTEDO is to keep reminding everybody that 85% of people who suffer from tardive dyskinesia are still not treated. And so the opportunity to keep helping these patients to bring these patients in and give them therapy, I think, is a significant growth driver for AUSTEDO.

So we also have the work we're doing on making sure that people can benefit from AUSTEDO XR. And as you can see there, 60% of new patients go on to AUSTEDO XR, and we know that helps with compliance and adherence, which obviously also in turn increases value. So I think we have a lot of value drivers for AUSTEDO, but I really don't want to get drawn into 2027 guidance at this moment. I think what I'm hoping people would see is what we have great momentum from '25. We're carrying that into '26, and we'll talk about '27 maybe this time next year.

Our next question comes from Ash Verma of UBS.

Ashwani Verma
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Congrats on all the progress. So maybe just first one, how are you thinking about funding the R&D? So increasingly seeing more royalties and/or profit share. Just when you think about it strategically, how do you balance not giving away attractive economics to your partner versus seeing a meaningful increase in your internal R&D spend as you fund the growing pipeline? And then secondly, on the TL1A upcoming maintenance data, we've seen some competitors that the maintenance data versus the induction sort of went up on efficacy measures by high single digit to mid-teens in terms of percentage points. Is that a fair expectation to have as you look towards your upcoming results?

Richard Francis
President, CEO & Director

Ash, thanks for the question. I'll tag team this with Eric again. But on the R&D funding, I think the question was, how are you going to fund this? Are you going to be giving away value if you keep doing these partnerships? So I think the way we think about it is we have a big late-stage pipeline. We have a lot of opportunities to drive significant value creation. And when you have a good pipeline, in my experience and my belief is it's about moving it faster to the market to have patients benefit from it and to get revenue. And so we're moving a big pipeline really quickly here.

Now how does it impact the economics? It really doesn't impact the economics in any meaningful way for a couple of reasons. One is these -- all these brands will be above $1 billion. Some of them will be multiple billion brands. The second thing is, which is an interesting fact that I think people miss on Teva is we're starting with a company with a very different gross margin than many other biopharma companies. So every time we launch an innovative product, it transforms our gross margin, which transforms our ability to drive EBITDA to drive EPS and cash flow.

So as I said, the fact that these are not in any way giving away value in the broadest sense. But even with regard to Teva, they don't because of where we actually start this journey. The other thing I'd also like to highlight on this, we are launching so many products over such a short period of time that, that is the focus we're on. And we're going to have a potential to launch 4 products in 5 years, and we're going to actually announce more and more indications. So I think the pipeline is about making sure we move it quickly to the market. But in no way are we giving away value. I'd say we're accelerating value because of the speed we're moving.

And then with regard to the key to the TL1A maintenance data, what are our expectations? I'll hand it over to Eric to answer, and then I'll conclude.

Eric Hughes
Executive VP of Global R&D and Chief Medical Officer

Sure. Yes. Thanks, Ash, for the question regarding what we anticipate from the maintenance data of TL1A. So I'd start off by saying what's the history we've been telling with regard to duvakitug at Teva. We started by saying that we found in our in vitro work that we had the most potent antibody, the most selective antibody and the one that probably has the lowest antidrug antibodies. I think it's about 3% to 5% we saw in our Phase II study.

So with that, we went into our Phase II program that we executed very well at speed. And then we came up with the highest reported numbers for both ulcerative colitis in Crohn's disease in 2 very well-controlled and run studies. So the in vitro translated into a very good result in Phase II. So if you translate that into what we anticipate in the maintenance, if you think that we have the most potent, the most selective, the lowest antidrug antibodies and that we can execute the study well, I would hope that when we lock the database, we see great results. So I'm bullish on it. Hopefully, that comes true, but we'll see what the data shows.

Richard Francis
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Eric. We stand by the fact that we have and we believe we have the best TL1A.

Our next question comes from Jason Gerberry of Bank of America.

Jason Gerberry
BofA Securities, Research Division

One for Eli, just I didn't catch this, but can you talk about in 2026 guide, sort of what's the gross margin outlook versus the OpEx spend ratio? I think the latter would be in that 27% to 28% range you guys have talked about historically, but I just wanted to make sure that, that was confirmed from a modeling perspective. And then just for my follow-up, on vitiligo, I was trying to maybe understand kind of what we're going to get with this upcoming Phase Ib. Will we get VASI75 scores through the full evaluable period? Are you expecting most of these 30-plus patients to make it through the full evaluable period? Just kind of wondering how robust that data will be.

Richard Francis
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Jason. Thanks for the question. So over to you, Eli, on the gross margin.

Eliyahu Kalif
Executive VP & CFO

Jason, thanks for the question. So on gross margin, we end up the year, if we exclude the 2 milestone payments at a 54.7% gross margin. We are looking to be in the range of 54.5% to 55.5% in 2026. In terms of the OpEx, there are kind of mainly 2 dynamics there. First of all, -- and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're going to see a bit higher OpEx, still in the range between 27% to 28% in the first half versus the second half just because of the revenue dynamics during the year. But there is also another element inside the OpEx, we're going to see more reduction in our G&A and actually shifting that reduction in between R&D and sales and marketing and able to stabilize it at the range of 27% to 28%. So this one didn't change versus our prior communication.

Richard Francis
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And the thing I'd add on to that, Jason, is gross margin is a really exciting story for us because as you see, as we continue to grow our innovative portfolio, we continue to launch products, that gross margin will just keep going up. It's just going to be a question of how much, but it will keep going up because of the fact that we're changing our portfolio so dramatically. Now with regard to the vitiligo data, I'll hand over to Eric.

Eric Hughes
Executive VP of Global R&D and Chief Medical Officer

Yes. Thank you, Jason, for the question. So the data that we're going to be presenting in the first half of 2026 is a single-arm study for patients with vitiligo. It's about 38 patients in total. It will have the traditional and known endpoints for this field, which is facial VASI and total VASI. So it will be easily comparable to other treatments out there. And that reminds me the important thing here is that there are limited treatments for vitiligo today. There's one approved, which is a topical that only covers 10% of your body. And ones that are in development are the ones that what we need, things that are systemic in treatment, not only the face, but the entire body, more than just 10%. So one of the exciting things we think about when we talk about our anti-IL-15 program in vitiligo is this has the potential to be a once subcutaneous shot every 3 months. So a quarterly shot potentially to treat a systemic disease. So we're looking forward to that. You'll -- I think you'll get data that we'll be able to compare it to other treatments out there in development and approved.

Our next question comes from Chris Schott of JPMorgan.

Christopher Schott
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just sticking on IL-15. On the development time lines in vitiligo, can you just elaborate what exactly you need for that 2031 pathway versus '34? And I guess, is there a similar opportunity in celiac there as well? And if I can just do a really quick one, just coming back to AUSTEDO. I think you were talking about roughly $100 million benefit in 4Q, and it sounds like that's between rebate and inventory. Just when we think about destocking in 1Q, can you just clarify how much of that was inventory and how much was kind of this reversal of rebates?

Richard Francis
President, CEO & Director

Thanks for the question, Chris. Eric, do you want to start with the anti-IL-15, vitiligo and celiac?

Eric Hughes
Executive VP of Global R&D and Chief Medical Officer

Sure. So thank you for the question on IL-15. So just to start off with IL-15 is it's a key cytokine in a number of different indications I mentioned before. We're working on vitiligo and celiac. I'm excited by both the potential for alopecia areata, atopic dermatitis or eosinophilic esophagitis. They're all interesting and important for this cytokine. For vitiligo, we're particularly excited because this is a program that we can move quickly. It has precedents for the regulatory endpoint. It's an endpoint that you can easily measure. You see the results. So that makes it a little bit more easy. And there's an unmet medical need here. We need systemic therapies, as I mentioned before. So we're thinking out of the box at Teva, we are accelerating this program in a clever pathway of a Phase II and Phase III study that we can work very quickly with the regulators. So the potential for a once quarterly dose subcutaneous shot is very exciting for us.

Richard Francis
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Eric. And then on the AUSTEDO question, Chris, the way to think about that $100 million is the vast majority, the vast majority pretty much was the inventory. So that's why, obviously, we have a lot of confidence about 2026 in our numbers. So hopefully, that helps, Chris.

Our next question comes from Umer Raffat of Evercore ISI .

Umer Raffat
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

If I look at the delta versus consensus this quarter, it looks like it's driven by sales and marketing when I take out the one-timer impact of the milestone. And coincidentally, I feel like this is probably the highest sales and marketing spend quarter we've seen in the last 3 years or so. So I'm curious why that is, especially because it's happening in the middle of the transformation that's underway, number one.

Secondly, for '26 guidance, is it fair to say that the Royalty Pharma $75 million payment for Phase IIb is embedded within the EBITDA? And is there any other milestones that are baked into the EBITDA guidance as well from TL1A or anything else? And then finally, on vitiligo, OPZELURA obviously has not necessarily done too well, but as Eric pointed out, has limited coverage. But is it fair to say that on the scores like OPZELURA showing about 30% facial VASI75 score, you would want to be tracking meaningfully north considering Royalty Pharma is all excited and they're not funding celiac only doing vitiligo. I'm just curious about your overall take on expectations.

Richard Francis
President, CEO & Director

Umer, thanks for the questions. You got a few into that one question there. So thanks for that. On the sales and marketing and the OpEx, I'll hand that to Eli to talk about.

Eliyahu Kalif
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. Umer. So first of all, about the question about Royalty Pharma, out of the $75 million, the way that we're viewing, it's actually going to spread over '26 and '27 with 1/3 out of the $75 million going to happen in '26. It's more kind of backloaded for '26 year. And that's the only thing that's embedded there. We don't have any other, I would say, assumptions in our EBITDA related to TL1A milestones or anything like that. As far as related to the sales and marketing, if you actually back out the higher revenue due to the milestone, you get to kind of a 15.4% on sales and marketing.

But going forward, next year, we're going to see that one actually 16%, and why? Because we are keeping investing in our growth engine, which is AUSTEDO and actually heading to next year, building kind of investment into our olanzapine launch. So we're going to see that one increasing. But all in all, the whole bucket going to be, from a dollar perspective, really kind of flat, but also from a percentage perspective due to the fact that you will see our transformation program going to impact the G&A, as I mentioned to Jason, and that's kind of a reduction in G&A going to split in between the R&D investment and into the sales and marketing.

Richard Francis
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Eli. And look, one thing I'll just add on to the back of that before I hand it over to Eric. If you think about the guidance for this year, the EBITDA range, I think, is showing the value of the programs we put in place, the value of driving our innovative portfolio, the fact that when we talk about our transformation program, it was $700 million of net savings after investing in our growth drivers. And so we've allowed ourselves to make sure that we can drive this innovative portfolio, which helps drive that EBITDA, but at the same time, our efficiency programs help also drive the EBITDA. So I think we're very pleased and proud of the fact that our EBITDA starts with a 5 in front of it, which I think is important. But we're very mindful of how we spend our money and where we allocate our capital. When it comes to vitiligo, I'll hand that over to Eric.

Eric Hughes
Executive VP of Global R&D and Chief Medical Officer

Thank you, Umer, for the question. So when it comes to what data we've seen with the topical out there today and what's in development, I always want to be competitive on any endpoint what you talk about. So hopefully, when we lock the database and get that results, we can show that we're competitive against what's available. But again, let's focus again what patients need. They need systemic therapy that's conveniently given. So it's almost inappropriate to compare it to a topical on 10% of your body. But certainly, we hope to be competitive.

Our next question comes from Les Sulewski of Truist.

Leszek Sulewski
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the progress. I just wanted to focus on the biosimilars side. So what's the launch cadence and expected profitability profile, particularly given the U.S. channel and PBM dynamics? And then what are the prerequisites for targeting the 10 new products beyond 2028? And you've previously evaluated or mentioned reevaluating BD within the space. So what type of, whether it's in-licensing, co-development or tuck-ins fits your leverage and margin profile today? And has that bar changed given the latest policy dynamics?

Richard Francis
President, CEO & Director

Thanks for the questions. So talking about biosimilars, yes, it's an exciting time. And I think the fact that we built the second largest portfolio and continue to add to it in such a short space of time is a testament to the prioritization we put behind it. But to sort of give you a bit of specifics and -- when we talk about -- we have 10 in the market now, we have 6 to launch between now and '27. Those 6 -- majority of those will be across both U.S. and Europe, which is important because we haven't actually had a presence in Europe of any significance. And we know that market is a market with quicker uptake, more predictability and some very clear returns. So excited about that.

And to name just a few, we have biosimilar Prolia, biosimilar Xgeva, biosimilar Simponi, biosimilar Eylea and biosimilar Xolair. So we have a lot coming through of those markets and most of those are in both. I think it's Simponi that's just in the U.S. Now you highlighted the 10. And you sort of -- in your question, it sounded like we had targeted 10. No, we have 10. They are in our pipeline. But we're just going to add to that. So we have 10, which is why I said we can start launching '28 onwards, but we are continually adding to that.

And the final part of your question is doing this through partnerships, how does that work out in gross margin. So we are going to continue doing it through partnerships, and it still is attractive from a gross margin point of view with the right partnership. It's still accretive to our business, our generics business significantly. So that's how we do it. And you'll probably start to see some deals coming through already in the first half of this year as we already build out this portfolio beyond the '26.

So -- and then the final thing I'll add on that, this biosimilar portfolio is coming through thick and fast, and that's going to really help us drive the generics business going forward, both in Europe and in the U.S. But thanks for your question.

Christopher Stevo
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Competitive Intelligence

Les, could you repeat your BD question, please?

Leszek Sulewski
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Essentially, I just wanted to get a sense of if there's a potential for you to kind of dive a little bit deeper via BD within the space, if there's anything available out there via partnerships that you've previously had and essentially what's your strategy for that space?

Christopher Stevo
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Competitive Intelligence

Sorry, are you asking about biosimilars?

Richard Francis
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So that's what I thought. So that's -- I think I answered that question, Les. We'll continue to do the partnerships. Some of those we already have good, big partnerships with companies that we think we can have the potential to expand those, whether that's mAbxience, whether that's Samsung. So I think we're looking at expanding. But also we have other companies that have approached us to be their partner because obviously, the performance we've had in the U.S. has been impressive. We have the fastest-growing biosimilar Humira. We have a very fast-growing business now in the U.S. So I think people are seeing that. But yes, it will be through partnerships, the majority of it.

Our next question comes from Dennis Ding of Jefferies.

Yuchen Ding
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I had 2, if I may. Number one, sort of a big picture question on R&D. What is your R&D philosophy at Teva? And I guess how much derisking do you think we'll get around the R&D platform from the data readouts this year? I'm also curious what else could be planned for 2027 as you advance some of these newer drugs forward? And then number two, just a question around BD. I'm curious as you transition to a novel biopharma company, if your BD philosophy has changed at all and if Teva might be interested in doing acquisitions in, let's say, the classic biotech space rather than what's historically been spec pharma.

Richard Francis
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Dennis. Thanks for the question. I'll tag team that with Eric and maybe start on the philosophy of R&D or maybe we call it the strategy.

Eric Hughes
Executive VP of Global R&D and Chief Medical Officer

Yes. No, thank you for the question, Dennis. And this is a very important question. And I think that the philosophy in the way that we operate at Teva is we are ruthlessly driven by data. We have, first and foremost, a pipeline in Phase III and Phase II that's relatively derisked. I think emrusolmin is probably the lowest on the probability of success. But when you think about our programs, we use known science, we combine it in a way that will execute well and quickly with regulatory approvals. And that's based and driven solely on data. One of the things I've noticed and been able to achieve here at Teva is when we see data, we pivot and we move forward with it. That's something I hadn't been able to do in my career in other places. So speed and execution driven by data with this philosophy of known science and derisked assets is how we will move forward. I think that's baked into every one of our programs at this point.

Richard Francis
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Eric. And then to move on to your next question, you said what about BD and as we pivot into a biopharma company. So firstly, thank you for the recognition that we are pivoting. And I think we pivoted. But anyway, we'll keep showing that with the pipeline as it comes out. But yes, we are actively looking at BD. We think we have a commercial powerhouse of the team. I think you've seen that with the results of AUSTEDO, UZEDY and AJOVY. And so we want to add to that team. Now that said, we have, as Eric highlighted, a really exciting pipeline. So the organic growth we have coming through is impressive. So we're not desperate to do BD. We don't have to. At the same time, it fits into our TA areas of CNS neurology and immunology, then I think it's very synergistic, and it makes a lot of sense.

So we are very active in that. What is interesting, I think, within the last year to 18 months, the amount of approaches we've had has significantly increased. And I think that's because they see Teva as a partner both from an R&D perspective, the speed which we move things through the clinic is exciting, but also primarily because of the commercial capability and muscle we have and the focus we give assets when we have an asset, whether it's in development, we focus and we move it quickly, whether it's in the market, we focus and we actually drive sales.

So I think we'll hopefully be able to talk about some things going forward, but we are very disciplined in our capital allocation, and we think it's the right asset at the right time at the right price, we'll definitely do it. But because of the pipeline we have that's coming through, we can stick to that in a very disciplined way, and we will because going back to that fourth pillar of the Pivot to Growth strategy, it's about focused capital allocation, making sure we give a good return on that in the short, medium and long term and create value for shareholders. So thanks for your question, Dennis.

And I think with that, I think that is the final question. We went over a bit, but I think we did start a couple of minutes late. So thank you for your questions and your interest in Teva, and I look forward to following this up later with our Q1 results. Thank you.
