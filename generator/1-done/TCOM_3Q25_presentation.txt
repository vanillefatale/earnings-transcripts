Thank you, Michelle, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on this call today. Travel is thriving and the travel spirit shows no signs of slowing down. In the third quarter, travel demand surged across markets, led by vibrant domestic travel in China and a steady rise in outbound journey. Travelers are exploring with confidence seeking authentic experiences in new horizons, a reflection of their enduring passion for discovery. This growing enthusiasm is mirrored in the performance of our AI-powered tools such as Trip.Planner, whose recent upgrade has fueled a 180% year-over-year surge in unique visits.

Inbound travel continues to play a vital role in fostering international exchange, trade and innovation, generating meaningful economic and cultural benefits. Expanded visa-free entry policies and broader coverage of the 240-hour transit visa exemption have made it easier than ever to visit, bringing the goal of raising inbound travel revenue to 1% to 2% of GDP increasingly within reach.
