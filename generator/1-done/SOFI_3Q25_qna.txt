[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Dolev at Mizuho.

Dan Dolev
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Chris, Anthony, amazing job. Very, very proud of you guys. Wanted to know, I mean, the question we're getting from investors for the past like month or so is consumer credit. I mean you guys have done incredibly well looking at NCOs coming down. But can you give us an overview of what's going on, maybe there's a FICO sort of differentiated thing here that helps SoFi? Just maybe an overall view of like how the health of the consumer credit across the different FICO trenches would be great. And congrats again.

Anthony Noto
CEO & Director

Sure. Thank you, Dan. The first message is our credit is performing very well. We have very strong performance by our members across each of the products, not just the performance of credit, but the spending that we see in SoFi Money, the engagement that we see in SoFi Invest and general behavior overall. We've been in the lending business for a pretty long period of time. When I joined in 2018, one of our key priorities is focused on quality of our loans over quantity and to make sure that those loans are durable through an economic cycle and through an interest rate cycle and any liquidity dislocations.

And so we're constantly making changes to what marketing channels we're in. The trade-up between pricing and credit approvals, the unit economics of a loan, we focus on having a 40% to 50% variable profit margin on our loans and so sometimes we can drive more volume, sometimes we can drive higher margin. But it's a constant data science opportunity for us to perfect our loans. And the strength of the consumer loans performance speaks for itself, it's in the numbers. You can see our net charge-offs declined, i.e., improved versus last quarter.

If you go back over the last couple of years, you'll see that we made a lot of credit changes to ensure that performance stayed high quality when we went through a 500 basis point interest increase and now we're seeing rates come down. So we're seeing really strong trends in the channels and great demand from high-quality borrowers. And we feel really confident. If anything changes, we'll make the adjustments accordingly. To remind everyone, we focus on a life loan loss between 7% and 8%, and all indications are that we're below that, as Chris has mentioned in the past.

Chris Lapointe
Chief Financial Officer

And the only other thing I would add to Anthony's point is that we're also seeing really good demand from capital markets partners, which we view as a flight to quality. So all in all, we remain vigilant as always, but our balance sheet is strong with high-quality loans, excess capital and solid liquidity, and our partners are active and looking to expand their relationships with us, and that's a true testament to the credit that we're underwriting.

The next question comes from John Hecht from Jefferies.

John Hecht
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Congratulations on a good quarter. I guess my question is predominantly around the rate environment, decreasing rates if you think about the forward curve. I'm wondering if you guys could talk about how the lower rate environment will affect the volume mix on the lending side? And particularly at what point do you think that could be a pretty big spike in student loan refinance activity? And then second, unrelated is maybe talk about what you guys expect in terms of deposit beta and what that means for NIM over the next few quarters?

Anthony Noto
CEO & Director

Thank you, John. We've said this in the past, our business is diverse, not because we woke up and said we should make our business diverse, but because of our strategy of being a one-stop shop. We've scaled our businesses across the portfolio of products that we offer being a one-stop-shop to a level that in environments, we can drive different businesses based on the characteristics of that environment. When rates were high, we took a specific strategy. As rates are coming down, we're taking alternative strategy and it's working. If rates stay exactly where they are, I think our business continues to operate incredibly well.

I couldn't be more optimistic about our near-term trends and what we'll do in 2026 relative to our prior long-term guidance. So I don't worry about the environment we're in right now. I do worry about things like credit. I do worry about things like heightened inflation. We look at asset flows, et cetera, et cetera. So it's not like we're not worried about things. We just feel really good about the positive things versus the things that could cause a problem.

As rates come down, I think our business only gets better. If we stay with unemployment below 5% to 5.5% and inflation is at 3%, I think we're in a really great environment. I'm not a student of believing inflation should be 2%. I think 3% is perfectly fine. I think we have global stability that will also be important. I think about things that could disrupt us as, one, economic, i.e., unemployment; two, financial liquidity. Rates are coming down, not going up; and then three is the macroeconomic factors that are at our control and exogenous events. As rates go down, our student loan business will benefit meaningfully. Rates have been very high for the last 3 years. Federal student rates are high, and we can give them a significant savings on a $70,000 balance. So we'll benefit from lower rates in student loan refinancing, for sure.

The home equity market, the home loan market, the real estate market more broadly, will benefit from lower rates, both in refinancing as well as purchase. As it relates to refinancing, less than 5% of our members that have mortgages have been with us. So if you take everyone that's on our platform that's using SoFi and you look at the number of those people that have home loans or mortgages, only 5% of those with mortgages are with us. It's a huge opportunity for us to market lower cost of a mortgage to them. And we have the technology to know where the rates are, to deliver personalized messages to them, and we've built the back end and operational capabilities to deliver reliable mortgage in a specific period of time. So we feel really great about that.

As it relates to SoFi Money, I've said this in the past, I'll say it again, it's starting to show itself now. In a high-rate environment, nonbanks can compete with us on interest rate. Many choose not to because they're trying to make more money with NIM, but it's easy when rates are high, when Fed funds are high. When Fed funds is low, it's going to be really hard for nonbank and nonlending companies to compete with us.

Our competitive advantage will come through and show the world that we have the highest lifetime value in a broad based portfolio of products allows us to give a superior yield when others are struggling to provide that yield because of the fact that we have both lending and we're insured deposit institution, and we have a broad-based membership that we can market to efficiently for cross-buy. In the most recent quarter, 40% of our product growth came from cross-buy, that's with our members growing 35%. Chris, would you add anything?

Chris Lapointe
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. The only other thing I would add, John, to your comments on deposit betas and NIM over the next few quarters, we've been really successful in maintaining healthy NIM margins. This last quarter, we were at 5.84%. Maintaining these strong margins has been a function of the loan pricing betas that we have as well as obviously, our cost of funds. What we've demonstrated on the loan pricing beta front is in rising-rate environments, we've been able to outpace rates and maintain really strong pricing. In down-rate environments, we've been able to maintain solid pricing above where rates have gone. And then from an asset yield perspective, we've been able to maintain strong asset yields and reduce our overall cost of deposits, all while maintaining healthy growth in member deposits last quarter. Historically, we've been at about a 65% to 70% deposit beta. We would expect that to continue going forward.

The next question comes from Kyle Joseph from Stephens.

Kyle Joseph
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Just wanted to get your thoughts on the competitive environment. Obviously, we saw your guidance for membership growth go up, which is obviously a positive. Is that a function of just kind of internal marketing efforts and brand awareness? Or can we step back and think about things potentially getting less competitive out there? I think you talked about capital providers and the flight to quality you're seeing. So I just want to get your commentary there.

Anthony Noto
CEO & Director

It's a function of many factors, first, unaided brand awareness. Our goal is to drive unaided brand awareness higher. It provides productivity across our digital marketing capabilities and performance marketing. And so we talked about the 9.1% unaided brand awareness that we achieved in Q3, that we expect to continue into Q4. We have a number of new product launches that will also contribute, that will not just contribute directly because they're new products, but they'll also contribute indirectly after raising awareness that we're a one-stop shop.

Specifically, our goal is to launch buy, sell and hold crypto by the end of the year. We'll continue to roll out SoFi Pay to other international markets. And so the second bucket is new products. And then the third, we have a pretty good understanding of what channels to market what product is in and have a good read on customer acquisition costs by channel. And so we're just ensuring that we continue to add more marketing at an efficient rate, focused on profitability and growth, and it's our confidence in being able to do that in a bigger way in Q4 than we did in Q3 in addition to the new product launches that we'll have, and the benefit from a brand awareness. So that's driving our confidence.

I will tell you our goal is to continue to move along a linear curve to make sure that we're not falling off that efficient frontier of marketing and brand awareness and spending. But there's a lot of upside from spending at efficient rates if we chose to grow even faster.

The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of William Blair.

Andrew Jeffrey
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Anthony, as you see faster growth in the nonpersonal loans business, which I think is really encouraging from a diversification standpoint, does that change your thought on how you fund that growth on balance sheet deposit driven versus the loan platform business? And are there opportunities in the loan platform business for nonpersonal loans? Just trying to think about what the funding mix looks like as the origination mix shifts a little bit?

Anthony Noto
CEO & Director

Sure. There are definitely opportunities in the loan platform business from nonpersonal loans, and Chris and the capital markets team is working on that. Funding off of deposits is definitely an element that drives our durability and our confidence in lending. The dependency on deposits will likely reduce over time and our cost of funds will also likely come down over time based on a bunch of decisions that we make as it relates to how to spend our capital.

I do think you'll continue to see us drive revenue streams that are not connected to capital. 56% of our revenue is now coming from our tech platform and financial services business, and that's up pretty meaningfully over time. And you can see the benefit to our profitability line and our ROE and our tangible book value growth related to that. So there's a number of initiatives that we have, that we haven't talked about publicly that will also help as we leverage blockchain technologies in the lending space specifically that will help drive strong diversification of funding for our balance sheet.

Next question comes from Kyle Peterson at Needham & Company.

Kyle Peterson
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Nice results. I wanted to drill down in the loan platform business, in particular. I know there's at least another fintech lender that kind of recently said that at least some of the loan buyers and such on from institutional investors were kind of consolidating purchases to kind of fewer platforms. I guess the strength this quarter, was it broad-based in terms of you guys adding participants on the platform on the funding side? Or was it fairly concentrated with existing partners? Just any color there. And if you guys are seeing anything similar would be really helpful?

Chris Lapointe
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Kyle. So we saw growth across both new partners as well as existing partners who have partnerships with us. What we actually saw is a bit of a flight to quality where existing partners -- a number of existing partners came to us and asked to upsize their commitments, not only in Q3 but Q4. So we expect continued momentum to occur in the last quarter of the year. And then we also saw some growth in new partners as well as extended credit. So net-net, it was growth across the board.

The next question comes from Reggie Smith at JPMorgan.

Reginald Smith
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great quarter. I guess I had a follow-up on the loan platform business as well. Is there a way to kind of frame the number of buyers on the platform and kind of what your mixed full quarter capacity looks like? And then also talk about the process, I think you mentioned this a second ago, Chris, about how companies upsize their commitment?

Chris Lapointe
Chief Financial Officer

Kind of out there at the end, Reggie, but I think you asked about the process for how companies upsize their commitments. In terms of your first question about the number of buyers on the platform and what the next quarter's capacity looks like, we aren't going to disclose the number of buyers that we have. We have disclosed a few publicly with Fortress and Blue Owl, but we have a number of partners on the platform.

What capacity looks like next quarter? We did $3.4 billion of originations on behalf of others this past quarter in Q3. We expect that to continue to grow heading into Q4. In terms of how companies upsize their commitments, they typically come to us intra-quarter if they have excess capacity or demand for incremental loans. And if we're able to fulfill by the end of the quarter, we'll do so.

Anthony Noto
CEO & Director

The behavior we're seeing of consolidation down to higher quality that you mentioned, we think we're benefiting from that based on the activity we've seen from those partners.

The next question comes from Peter Christiansen from Citigroup.

Peter Christiansen
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Nice trends here for sure. Anthony, I was just wondering, can you remind us where we are in your investment cycle, perhaps not just like the marketing or performance marketing, branding, those sorts of things, but maybe more so on capabilities? I know you're going to be onboarding some new clients on the tech platform pretty soon and now building out crypto, whether that's partnered or native. Just if you could frame for us where we are in the investment cycle.

Anthony Noto
CEO & Director

I would like to invest a lot more than we're investing, but we're trying to balance both growth and being responsible for delivering profitability and good returns. We don't want to go after penny less growth. And so the gating factor that we've put on and talked about publicly is to have at least a 30% incremental EBITDA margin. And I say the word at least because if the business does well relative to expectations, it's hard to spend back in a quarter. We may accelerate some hiring, but that really doesn't impact the near-term quarter, it impacts the next quarter. And we've hired a lot more people in 2025 than we set out at the beginning of the year because we've been driving both strong top line growth and really strong incremental profitability.

I would love to spend every dollar we could down to that 30% incremental EBITDA margin. It's not always possible to do that. That 30% incremental EBITDA margin will be the standard until we see our growth drop below, call it, 15%. I think as long as we're growing above that, we should invest in the business to make the top line as large as it can be. And then over time, we can slow down our spending and drive margin expansion, but we're definitely not in the mode of driving margin expansion unless we outperform compared to the 30% incremental EBITDA margin.

The areas we're investing is we'll continue to iterate our existing products. We're focused every day on 5 things of our existing products, fast, selection, content and convenience and then make them better together. There are some products that are new that we'll increase the investment in, such as SoFi Plus. We're really pleased with the progress we've made there.

There will be additional things that we add into SoFi Plus as it relates to value, one of which is the smart card. We think it's the best of any card. It will have high rewards, 5% on food. They'll also have high interest or highest APY. In addition to that, you can also build your credit score and you'll be able to use that relationship with us to potentially borrow both ahead of time and post transactions. And that will be an evolving feature set after we launch, that will continue based on how we learn our members want to use the product, but focusing on the smart things that they want, and making it have the best of everything.

We talked about Cash Coach on the call. There's a number of AI initiatives to help people spend less than they make and invest the rest. It is a unique formula that we can deliver on in addition to the investing piece. One of the things that's interesting about our buy, sell and hold for crypto is that the way we'll launch this product is going to be pretty novel. Someone will open up the SoFi Money account. If they don't have a SoFi Money account, they'll fund that SoFi Money account and then all their purchases are drawn from that SoFi Money account. What's the benefit of that? Well, that SoFi Money account has FDIC insurance. And we've added additional insurance for our members if they opt in, up to $2 million, not just $250,000.

So someone can have an FDIC-insured bank account where they keep their funds and seamlessly be able to buy cryptocurrency and the money moves from one entity to the next seamlessly behind the scenes. A very efficient process that I think will be very differentiated, and we'll be the first bank to offer buy, sell and hold crypto. We've mentioned stablecoin on the call. I can just tell you, every day, there's a new opportunity for us to leverage the SoFi USD stablecoin that we'll plan to launch. And we have some unique advantages that we're already a Tier 1 bank.

What do I mean by that? Because we are a Tier 1 insurer deposit institution, we could take the reserves of our stablecoin and put them at the Fed and earn Fed funds. What does that mean? Zero credit risk, zero liquidity risk. There's not a stablecoin provider in the United States that can make that claim. Very differentiated, super excited about it, and there's a number of other applications there. You can imagine that Fed funds that we earn on those reserves, they can be given back to the consumer.

They can be given to businesses to accept our payment at point of sale, and it can provide a lot of different benefits to other ecosystem partners that cause them to want to partner with us as opposed to a non-Tier 1 nationally licensed bank. So we're going to invest as much as we can to that 30% incremental EBITDA margin and sustain high levels of growth until it slows down and then will drive profitability.

The next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch from TD Securities.

Moshe Orenbuch
TD Cowen, Research Division

Maybe a little bit about the competitive dynamic in the personal loan business. I saw one of your close competitors got acquired by a large bank. First, do you think that makes the business kind of a better competitive dynamic if that happens? Or maybe just talk about that a little bit? And if you could also just address, you talked about becoming more capital light. How much of that do you think comes out of the personal loan business in terms of doing less for your balance sheet or proportionately more in the loan platform side?

Anthony Noto
CEO & Director

In terms of competition for PL, I'd say it's generally been a competitive environment. But from entities that are not large national banks or the top 10 banks in our country, they just don't offer this product. I think there's a lot of reasons for why they don't offer this product. It's a gap in their portfolio that allows us to really gain, I think, more members at efficient costs. I think the reason why they probably don't offer their product is because they gouge people so about on credit cards, and it's such a great ROE product that they don't want to cannibalize the credit card.

The way you make money in the credit card business is to revolving balances. Well, credit cards average in the United States over 20% interest on those revolving balances. If you actually had a prime member or super prime member, and told them they're going to charge 20%, they wouldn't sign up for that any day. But if you put that behind a fancy name of the card and all these benefits and high rewards, no one sees the high interest rate that they get. And they chase those reward points thinking they're getting some benefits from it.

Then they end up with a balance that they can't pay off after 1 month. And then they said they'll do it after 2 months. And before you know, it's been 6 months. They now have a $10,000, $15,000 balance, they're paying 20% to 30% interest on it. Would you refinance them with a personal loan at 12%? Probably not. So I think this is a product that we're going to own from a leadership standpoint. We'll continue to fight away at these huge balances where people are paying over 20% interest when they can come to us and pay 12%, again, prime and super prime customers.

Chris Lapointe
Chief Financial Officer

And then what I would say on your point about being capital light and how much of it comes out of the PL business, what I would say is total personal loan originations were up 53% this past quarter year-over-year and 7% sequentially to a record of $7.5 billion. So we don't see much in terms of overall cannibalization, given our current market share, which is about 15% of total unsecured loans out there within our credit box and that doesn't even scratch the surface of all of the outstanding credit card debt, as Anthony mentioned.

So we're seeing really good momentum on the LTV side, and we're adding loans to the balance sheet at a pace that we are comfortable and happy with. This past quarter, we added about $2.7 billion of personal loans to the balance sheet, which is a good healthy clip for us.

Our final question today comes from Devin Ryan, Citizens Financial Group.

Devin Ryan
Citizens JMP Securities, LLC, Research Division

I want to come back to the student loan opportunity. Obviously, you talked about kind of the outlook moving into a better place there with the rate environment. Can you talk a little bit about how you see some of the actions of this administration driving kind of a better environment, whether it's the Big Beautiful Bill? And then a few weeks ago, there was, obviously, headlines around the government exploring, selling some of its $1.7 trillion in balances, which would seem pretty interesting for you guys. So love to get some thoughts on that. I'm not sure if you can speak to it directly, but just more broadly, if you can, just what you think that means for the market and kind of the direction of travel?

Anthony Noto
CEO & Director

Yes. I think it's all very positive for SoFi. I think we benefit from all of those decisions as they get made. We look at assets from time to time that are for sale. If the government decides to sell their student loan portfolio, we'll absolutely dig into it. It'd be a great customer acquisition tool, not to mention the fact that we can make a significant profit on that portfolio of assets.

As it relates to potentially reducing the amount someone can borrow in order to go to college or grad school or business school or medical school or a law school, we'll be there to fill the hole. We want to help our members achieve the financial independence so they can live their ambitions. Paying for college, paying for a home is absolutely a critical decision they make. And we have to be there for all those major decisions they make. So we'll absolutely be there. If they need a solution that the federal government is not providing, then that will also be a great business.

Our in-school business for loans is a very profitable business that's very attractive and doing more of that would be even better than the student loan refinancing. It's higher rates, it's backed by credit of another person and people really do want to pay back the benefit that they receive from getting a college education. So that would also be an opportunity.

I would say more broadly, as we think about our educational system and think about the changing needs from a technology standpoint, AI, there may be new types of loans that we could get into from a student loan perspective that's outside of a 4-year type of experience, that's more suited for the professional environment new graduates will enter into. So I think we'll actually see some innovation because of what the government is doing and because of the impact technology is having on hiring undergrounds.

Operator

And that concludes -- back to you.

Anthony Noto
CEO & Director

Thank you, operator. Sorry about that. As you can see, it was an eventful quarter at SoFi and we are energized as we wrap up 2025 and headed 2026. Today's results reflect the durability of the foundation our team has been tirelessly building over the last 8 years. It was not clear before today. I think it's safe to say that our results demonstrate that we truly have become a one-stop shop for your financial needs all in 1 digital platform.

Many others have talked about achieving this strategy, but to date, no one else has come close to the breadth of products or complexity of operations that we have, not to mention the revenue scale we have, the profitability we're generating and the durability and broad diversification of revenue across our portfolio of products. This success positions us the best to benefit from the two tech super cycles unfolding and the continued strong sector transition globally from traditional finance companies to fintech companies.

Suffice it to say, I'm more confident than ever that our strategy and our execution will continue to deliver our sustainable competitive advantage with the highest lifetime value and we'll accelerate our investment to ensure we maintain our lead. Along the way, we will remain guided by the SoFi Way.

We are all operating as founders, problem solvers and partners to bring the best products and services to our members so we can have a meaningful impact on their lives, and lead them to a better, more secure financial future. By acting in the best interest of our members, we will build deeper relationships across our one-stop shop platform that will lead to durable growth and strong returns for our shareholders for decades to come.

Thank you for joining our call, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.
