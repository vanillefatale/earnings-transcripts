[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.

Ryan Nash
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Bruce, I appreciate all the details on the Reimagining the Bank. I think you noted in the slides that this should add 2% on ROTCE. First, maybe just talk about how much of this hits the bottom line versus gets reinvested? And if it is reinvested, what are the areas that you will invest in?

And then second, the Slide 28 says that you're not incorporating any of these benefits. Does this increase your confidence in getting to the high end? Or do you think this serves more as a hedge in case other parts of the business don't perform? And I have a follow-up.

Bruce Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. Okay. Garner the space for that follow-up. Nice move. So I would say that at this point, the program has taken shape and we have about 50 work streams, and it's all signed out into a transformation office and people that are running with the ball on those streams. And Brendan is kind of leading the overall effort, he can comment as well.

So I think at this point, we have kind of quarter-by-quarter visibility into each of those work streams and how the kind of implementation costs flow and then how the benefits start to flow. One thing you'll notice there is that over time, the kind of revenue benefits start to pick up as we'll see improved customer experience, resulting in less customer attrition, better usage of our products by the customer base. And we think that's really solid in terms of our ability to forecast that. So anyway, the program has taken shape. We're executing it well.

As to the question of what do we expect to flow through, I think the first thing is you got to look at the gross number, excluding the implementation costs, because implementation costs really are just kind of onetime capital costs in our view. So the run rate will benefit by the full amount. And then I think it's still a bit of an open question as to how much of that flows through. And it kind of depends on kind of where we are at that point in time and what our investment needs and priorities could be. So do we keep investing at the same pace in the Private Bank? And is it worth investing to keep on that trajectory and to generate more medium-term revenue growth? I think that's a TBD.

So at this point, we're kind of just flagging here's the numbers, here's what we think is possible. We have a lot of wood to chop to actually execute this program, but we'll be reporting on it all along. And then we'll have, I think, more visibility into the flow-through as time goes by. If you look historically at all of our top programs, Ryan, we've had a significant flow-through. And so we tend to be very disciplined on the remaining expense base. We have this mindset of continuous improvement. If we want to invest new dollars, try to figure out where to pinch the expense base to self-fund that. So I would expect that the flow-through should be high, but we're not going to make that call at this point. We're just going to give you the contours of what the program could deliver.

Ryan Nash
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then if I look on Slide 27, your prior NIM walk had deposit betas in the low to mid-50s. I think now you're saying high 40s. Maybe just talk about what is driving the change? Is it competition or a change in your strategy? And what are some of the offsets that are allowing the NIM to still reach slightly higher levels versus the prior expectations?

Bruce Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. So what I would say is that when the rates first started to fall, the market was very aggressive in trying to recoup some of what happened on the way up. And what's happened since then, I think, is that the market is kind of less aggressive in its pricing actions at this point. And so you could call that maybe a little more competition or you could just say kind of a decision to share kind of some of those benefits with the customer and not be as aggressive. And so that high 40s to us is really the market. So we're not -- if we move down from mid -- low to mid-50s to high 40s, I think that's consistent with what we're seeing in the market.

And the reason that I still think we're in a very good position to deliver on that NIM walk are several factors contributing to that. But one is our confidence in our net interest -- our noninterest-bearing balance growth, which has stayed robust in the Private Bank and in the consumer bank, in particular, and stable in the commercial bank. And so we, I think, score well on that dimension.

You know that we're also slightly asset sensitive, and our view is that rates will come down, but maybe not as much as feared initially. So I think that is a helpful fact for us as well. And then over time, we've continued to, I think, be very disciplined in our hedging actions. And so we've been adding in hedges at attractive rates. So I think it's the combination of those 3 things, the kind of noninterest balances, the higher -- a little bit of asset sensitivity and a higher rate outlook and then these attractive hedging actions that we've taken would offset that beta dropping from where it was to the high 40s.

Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS.

L. Erika Penala
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Just wanted to ask about the puts and takes on the loan growth guide. It feels like a bit of a sort of best-in-class relative to peers. Maybe remind us, Bruce, in terms of where you are in your balance sheet optimization journey. And as we come to a point where rates may come down, talk to us about the push-pull in terms of optimizing CRE versus taking advantage of potential refinancing opportunities?

Bruce Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. So I'd say our confidence in that loan outlook stems from actually what we're seeing and what we delivered in the second half of the year. So we have an idiosyncratic growth driver in the Private Bank as they scale up their business. That's something our peer banks don't have. And so that continues at a good clip. And then I think the focus of the commercial bank in terms of the middle market and our expansion markets plus some of the kind of private capital and sponsor lines also has been an area of opportunity for us. And then kind of in the consumer bank, we have the market-leading HELOC product and also mortgage. And so we've seen growth across all 3 of those areas in Q3 and in Q4, and we think that will continue.

In kind of prior years, that growth was offset by the accelerated rundown of non-core, but now we have non-core kind of at -- kind of almost at a stub at this point from $14 billion down to like $2.5 billion. And then we've done a lot of work already on the commercial BSO and on the Commercial Real Estate kind of rundown after the Investors acquisition. And so there's a slide in the back, Erika, which you may have seen or may not have seen, but kind of lays down some of the reductions in the drag from those efforts, which also contributes to positive sentiment on loan growth.

So those are the kind of big things. I'll just maybe flip it over first to Don to talk a little bit about commercial and then Brendan to talk about the Private Bank and consumer.

Donald McCree
Chair of Commercial Banking

Yes. I'll start, Erika, by just talking about the environment. I mean across the board, we're seeing positive sentiment from the client base. So Bruce mentioned the expansion markets, they're growing. So I think New York, California, Florida, they're growing extremely quickly. Those are core middle market relationships with full wallet realization. So not only is loan growth materializing, but we're also seeing it from an ROE standpoint being very attractive business.

We're seeing -- remember, for most of the last 2 or 3 years, the market has been really a refinancing market. I think Aunoy mentioned that. We're seeing new money demand, both in our core client base, which is translating into utilization growth. And we're seeing it powerfully in the sponsor business where the sponsors finally seem to be coming alive, and that will impact not only our Capital Markets businesses, but also our NBFI lending as we engage with the private capital community, both on the PE capital call lines and private capital leveraging lines.

So across the board, a pretty strong environment to be operating in. And that should drive higher levels of loan growth as we look into '26 and beyond. We were probably running close to $1 billion of C&I BSO over the last few years, that really is down to BAU. We're pretty much done with that. If it was going to be $0.5 billion, I'd be surprised, but it will be just a continuous kind of rhythm of cleaning out under-returning relationships and replacing them with new relationships.

And then the change in real estate, we're going to continue to trim the real estate exposures, but we're beginning to turn on the origination engine, and that's both Private Bank and commercial bank, and we will be replacing some of the BSO that's happening with some attractive opportunities as we see them in the marketplace. So what was a pure drag in the past will be a little bit less of a drag in the future, although we'll continue to kind of trend that down, but BSO will become less of a drag on the overall loan growth.

Brendan Coughlin
President & Vice Chair

On my side, maybe 3 points here. One, similar to Don, the headwind on non-core is reducing. So just to give you some numbers around it, 6, 7 quarters ago, we were dealing with $1 billion, $1.1 billion in quarter-on-quarter rundown of non-core. That exited Q4 at $0.5 billion, and that's going to continue to minimize as we look forward into 2026. So that's a real positive to see that wrap through the cycle.

We've seen really strong growth in private banking, point number two, and it's been really balanced across private equity, residential lending and multifamily granular high-quality commercial real estate where we have access to full relationships with Wealth Management. One of the dynamics we were facing early in 2025 is with rates high, there was a lot of cash out in the system with this client base, and they were hesitant to go in and finance things with debt with rates as high as they were. That is starting to change. And as the rates ease a bit, we expect loan growth demand to pick up in the Private Bank and our run rate to improve further. So we've got confidence there that the pace of growth in the Private Bank will continue to accelerate as we look into 2026.

And then in consumer, as Bruce mentioned, we're getting $700 million to $800 million in quarter-on-quarter growth in HELOC. We're #1 in net balance sheet growth in the United States, #1 in originations in the United States in HELOC and a very high credit quality book with 95% plus of the customers coming with DDA and deep relationship-based banking. We expect that to continue. And candidly, with rates pulling back, but not so far to cater through a 5% mortgage rate, at least in the forward outlook, it's really a perfect time period for HELOC, where there's not going to be a ton of mortgage refinancing activity, but huge amounts of equity built up with consumers.

So we're very, very well positioned to continue to monetize the HELOC capability we've put in place. And of course, in the second half of last year, we launched a credit card portfolio, which we expect will start to pay some dividends as we get into 2026 first half and second half with higher yielding, higher quality balances. So for all those reasons, I feel really good about continued pickup in net loan growth.

The other thing I would just mention wrapping up here is it's important to look at the net loan growth number. But under the covers, there's a quality story that you need to pay attention to of the balance sheet remixing to deep relationship-based customer lending, higher yielding, higher profitability, both on the balance sheet, but also the net customers we're bringing in, moving away from single service to a really, really deep relationship-based bank. So I think we've got confidence on winning on both dimensions, quantity plus quality.

Our next question comes from Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley.

Manan Gosalia
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I wanted to start on the fee side. Can you expand a little bit on the underlying assumptions of the fees? I mean it feels like the Private Bank is doing well. Capital Markets are doing well. Pipelines are strong. You had a survey out recently talking about M&A expanding on the middle market side. There's also been some push out from the fourth quarter into 2026. Just given all of that, it feels like the fee guide is a little conservative. So can you help us with some of the underlying assumptions there?

Bruce Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. So I'll start and others can chime in. But we had a very strong fee year in 2025. So we'll start with that. We were up 11%. And then to guide up next year, 6% to 8% is still kind of good growth on top of very strong growth that we had in '25. I'd say the outlook for '26 is led by the capital markets, where not only do we have strong pipelines, we have several things going for us. One is the carryover. So we have about $20 million of fees that carries over that will close in the first quarter.

And then in the first half of 2025, we had kind of soft comparisons, I would say, because of the uncertainty in Liberation Day tariffs. There's a lot of pent-up demand to do deals that started to flow again in the second half of the year. So again, I think Capital Markets should have a strong relative year. And again, who knows about the uncertainty in the tariffs. And it seems like Groundhog Day, we might be in that same movie replaying. But I think that's one of the reasons why, overall, it's good to have a little bit of caution in that guide of 6% to 8%. You just don't know. But at this point, Capital Markets look like it will have an extremely strong year.

Wealth has been having record quarter after record quarter. And that's a twofold benefit. It's not only kind of getting the teams in place of recruiting these lift-outs and then connecting them to the Private Bank relationships and the corporate bank relationships, which creates its own growth dynamic. But then also in the branch-based system, we've got great leadership there, great product set. We're really hitting our stride. So I think Wealth would be other shining star.

Across the rest of the patch, we don't see significant growth in many of the other areas like service charges on deposit accounts, mortgage. Our other income was flattered. We had like the moon and the stars align for a couple of quarters that might not repeat in 2026. So I think just having a level of conservatism there seems like the way to play it.

Manan Gosalia
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Very helpful. And then maybe pivoting over to the capital side. It looks like your buyback guide is a little more front-end loaded. And then you spoke about the fact that you're hopeful that the SCB will come down this year. I guess the question is how important is the stress test in terms of your comfort level in bringing the CET1 ratio closer to your medium-term targets of like 10% to 10.5%? How quickly can you do that? And where would getting into that range put you in terms of buybacks as you get into the back half of the year?

Bruce Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Sure. Again, I'll take this one. I've been living it on this SCB frustration for years. But we are reasonably optimistic that there's some changes afoot down in Washington with the Fed. And so based on what we know, we think we'll get a better outcome. And it remains to be seen the timing of that implementation. But to me, it's less of an impact directly on where we set our capital targets. It's just been -- it's almost a scarlet letter that we have this outsized SCB when our business model is the same as most of our peers, and it just has been mismodeled, and I won't get into all of it, but we've made those points clear to the new folks that are going to be in charge of the stress test.

So in any case, just falling back into the pack is good for us reputationally even if it doesn't affect exactly how we're going to manage the capital. I would say the reason that we're still on the high end of that 10% to 10.5% range is just still the amount of uncertainty that's in the environment. We have an upsurge in our profitability projected, but making sure that we get there and that we get the CRE worked out when we feel the environment is in a better place, and we've accomplished some of those aspects, then I think we could be in a position to start to migrate down within that range. But anyway, that's how we think about it.

Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.

Girard Sweeney

This is Girard Sweeney on for John. Just want to revisit the Private Bank build-out specifically. In that $11 billion to $13 billion in Private Bank-related loans in 2026, can you break down what loan categories within the Private Bank you're seeing growth? Any puts and takes there? And then longer term, how should we think about the loan-to-deposit ratio trending in the Private Bank?

Brendan Coughlin
President & Vice Chair

Yes, it's Brendan. I can take that. It's pretty balanced growth. So about 1/3 of it, I would say, is coming from C&I private equity-based lending. We have about half of the balance sheet is, I'd say, residential and real estate, so mortgage and granular multifamily commercial real estate, as I mentioned before, tied into deep wealth management-based clients. And then there's a smaller portion in sort of other consumer.

So our HELOC capabilities are making their way over to these clients, some small credit cards, some specialty unsecured lending loans in the private banking portfolio, the PLP partner loans that we're leveraging to convert our private equity community into personal private banking relationships. So it's pretty broad-based, but the largest categories are C&I, granular multifamily, CRE and residential lending mortgage. We expect that to continue [ as rates to ] pull back. The traditional personal private banking should pick up. That would -- again, going to -- the portfolio will benefit from HELOC and continued residential lending. And as our card portfolio picks up, we have optimism that, that can be a more meaningful player in the Private Bank over time.

Bruce Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. I would just add to that, that we've been in business now for a couple of years. We haven't had one -- I'm going to touch wood here when I say this, we haven't had $1 of credit losses, and that historically was the track record of these bankers when they operated on the First Republic platform. So very strong credit discipline, very deep relationships, lending to people that we know well and getting good credit results.

Brendan Coughlin
President & Vice Chair

You asked about the LDR, too. Sorry, I didn't answer that. Our 25% ROE is certainly benefiting from a little bit wider loan-to-deposit ratio than we probably would expect in a steady state. And so -- but you can also see in our guide, we don't expect dramatic meaningful changes in the short term. We're going to expect pretty balanced growth across deposits and lending. So we expect a self-funding mechanism here where not only is the LDR led with deposits, but the lendable deposits also fully self-fund the loan growth that we're getting.

Having said that, over the medium-term outlook, I would expect that LDR to tighten maybe from in the 60s where we are today into the 80% range potentially. But that's if rates pull back. Right now, we still think it's -- it will be in this range of 60% to 70% for the next year to 6 quarters.

Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.

Matthew O'Connor
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

A bit of a follow-up to some comments you just made. I wanted to ask about the deposit growth assumption. I found the interest there. I think that's what's driving the higher net NII outlook, but your earning asset growth is obviously a bit above the loan growth on Slide 23. So just trying to get a sense of deposit growth assumptions. And obviously, you give us the Private Bank, which is the one piece, but just the overall assumptions there and the confidence in that level.

Bruce Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. Well, we don't have a deposit guide here, but I think the expectation, Matt, is that the LDR will stay relatively stable over the course of the year. So we brought it down. You may recall we were operating back in '23 kind of in the high 80s. We brought it down in '24 into the low 80s. We now have it down into the high 70s, which is a place that I think we can sustain that and feel good about kind of the liquidity position there. And -- so that's kind of the overall forecast. I don't know, Aunoy, if you want to add anything to that.

Aunoy Banerjee
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think, the only other thing to add would be probably our noninterest-bearing deposit growth has been very steady as well, both coming from the Private Bank and as well as the consumer bank. We expect that 22% to be in the zone as we go through.

Brendan Coughlin
President & Vice Chair

The 2 points I'd add on the noninterest-bearing would be, [ it was what ] we've gone through a period post-COVID, 3 years of consistent headwinds on spending out the excess surplus. 2025 was a year of that kind of running its course and flattening out. We started to see some very modest DDA growth in most benchmarks in the consumer bank. We were #1 in our peer set on relative DDA performance versus peer banks. We expect that relative position to continue and move from a flattening to starting to see some very modest DDA growth.

And in the Private Bank, you can see our DDA percentage in the high 30s, but it's important to also look at checking with interest, the entirety of the personal banking deposits in the Private Bank are in checking with interest, which is de minimis interest. When you add that in, our actual low-cost mix is in the mid-40s, and we expect that range to continue the combination of DDA plus checking with interest. So healthy, healthy growth in the Private Bank in noninterest-bearing or low interest-bearing and continued #1 performance or top quartile performance in the consumer bank on relative DDA.

Matthew O'Connor
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And then just on the interest-earning asset growth, it's kind of 1% to 2% both loan growth and maybe deposit growth. Anything else driving that? I think we've seen more banks point to kind of less earning asset growth on loan growth and yours is the opposite. So I was just wondering if there's something else kind of driving that. I think you've expanded your swap business for customers. So I don't know if there's something with trading assets or a rethinking of how you hedge the balance sheet.

Bruce Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

I would say the spot loans is 3% to 5% and earning assets kind of 4% to 5%. So there may be a little build in liquidity, we may be adding to the securities book. Part of that is looking at the lendable deposits and the kind of what we see as growth in the Private Bank deposits, which have a little lower lendability than the consumer deposits do. And so it's really probably just a little mix in where we're building a bit of our liquidity to go match what we're doing in terms of the deposit composition growth.

Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.

Ebrahim Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

I guess just a couple of quick follow-ups. As we think about the 16% to 18% return ROTCE exiting '27, it implies the margin probably being somewhere between around that 3.40% to 3.50%. Am I thinking about that correctly?

Aunoy Banerjee
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I would say think of that, Ebrahim, in that zone, yes.

Ebrahim Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

And then beyond that, as we think about the new growth that's coming on the balance sheet, on Slide 19 for Private Bank, you call out the 4.1% spread on that growth. I'm just wondering if you had to have a similar number for the entire balance sheet in terms of growth, where would you say that new growth is coming? Is it close to 4%, close to 3%? I would love any color there.

Bruce Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. That's an interesting question. I guess I would say the spread in the Private Bank and the consumer bank are relatively higher. The spread in commercial is relatively lower. Commercial, you're extending credit to build relationships and do the cross-sell to your fee-based complex. So that's a little bit of the dynamics there.

Ebrahim Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. And just one more, Bruce, on the Private Bank, 7 offices, 4 more to go. Why is that number not larger? Like is it -- is there only so much that you can do from a management bandwidth standpoint? Or do you think once you have these 10 to 15 private bank offices, you've saturated the opportunity?

Bruce Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Well, I'll start and flip it to Brendan. But I'd say from a bandwidth standpoint, you want to make sure that these offices are really premium locations and premium fit-out and premium high-quality people staffing them. And so we've done a lot, and we have another big agenda for this year, but we're certainly not done when you get to exhaust the list that we have in front of us for '27. We have a couple more in the pipeline that are straddling between '26 and '27. And then we have densification of some of our East Coast locations in Florida still in front of us when we look out into '27.

So I think ultimately, you could see this number get up to something like 25 or 30 when we've kind of reached maturity with the private banking locations that we have before we would think about potentially other geographic expansion. But Brendan, I'll flip it to you.

Brendan Coughlin
President & Vice Chair

Yes. Our confidence is clearly increasing every quarter that gets behind us on our ability to drive sustainable growth and high quality. But if you kind of rewind the clock back to 4 quarters ago, we were very committed to make sure we deliver the profitability profile that we shared with you all before we got too far over our skis. So we've been very thoughtful in terms of where to put these locations. It's a very connected business model. I call it first floor, second floor, first floor being kind of retail banking for private banking customers, second floor being senior RMs and wealth teams that are not necessarily working the retail branch, but they're bringing in clients. We've got to grow that in a connected way.

So -- and we're keeping a very, very high bar on quality. We don't want to grow so fast that we compromise on having a best-in-market team. So we've got aspirations for more sites. We'll continue to add them as we get the right teams, as we get the right locations. We're starting to think about geographic expansion. We also have to think about filling in the rest of our Citizens footprint. You've got plenty of markets that we have high net worth individuals in today where we don't yet offer the full private banking package.

And so in addition to adding more sites, you may see a handful of very targeted either conversions or dual branded sites with retail and private banking coming online where we can offer the full service of the bank, the full One Citizens in the same market. So -- with commercial partnering as well. So a lot to do. We expect a steady [ guide ] of continued openings and opportunistically when we find talent in good locations, we'll upsize our ambition.

Our next question comes from David Chiaverini with Jefferies.

David Chiaverini
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

So I wanted to ask about the efficiency ratio outlook. It looks very strong, mid-50s medium term versus the 62% in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about what could drive the high end versus the low end of the mid-50s outlook?

Bruce Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. Well, there's a couple of dynamics here that right off the bat, if you overlay the kind of termination of these swaps and look at some of the built-in kind of active swaps and fixed asset repricing that we think is pretty assured, you can get from 62% into the high 50s. And if you overlay the RTB, that can further take you down into the mid-50s. And then all along, we're trying to run with positive operating leverage, even if you strip out the benefit of the NIM expansion. So those are really the 3 things that are kind of driving you back down to something in the mid-50s. So I think it's a very realistic target.

David Chiaverini
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

And my follow-up is on AI. You've been front-footed on AI versus some of your peers. Can you talk about your AI spend and some of the use cases you're seeing?

Brendan Coughlin
President & Vice Chair

Yes. Our AI spend has, I would call it, backwards looking in 2025 has been a combination of very small targeted pilots and learnings and building the right control infrastructure to get ourselves ready for this, including moving completely to the cloud in 2025 and big investments in data. So to actually take the AI capabilities and commercialize it, a lot of foundational things need to be true. So some of this happened in 2025. Candidly, some of this started back in 2020, 2021, where we're really getting some bigger investments in broadening our data capabilities, modernizing the tech stack to put us in a position for this.

So enabling investments has been high, very specific kind of last mile AI investments, I think, have been very relatively modest. But as we turn the page to 2026, the dial turns a little bit. So a couple of the use cases, of course, we highlight them on Page, I guess, it's 21 in the deck, and you can look at that, but I'll maybe highlight 2 or 3 of them.

The call center, as an example, we think that the combination of modernizing the tech stack for the call center front to back, plus introducing voice AI and other mechanisms, we can get in the range, over the medium-term outlook, 50% of our call center calls out of a human answering them. That is something we're very excited about. It's not hopes and dreams. We've seen this in development and in action in smaller firms, banks and otherwise. So we're leaning in heavily there.

Technology development, accelerating productivity of an engineer is a use case that we also have high confidence in that through leveraging AI, we can have a 5 to 10x of productivity with our engineers that the AI is taking the first crack at writing the code where developers are now QA/QC-ing the code, adding the last mile and then ultimately having the AI also work on the first round of testing and quality assurement of the code.

And then maybe lastly, on just analytics, fraud, credit risk, these are tried and true AI use cases that with -- particularly in the consumer bank relative to fraud and credit analytics where you're underwriting and decisioning on a cohort basis, leveraging AI to reengineer front to back, how we think about credit analytics, portfolio monitoring, fraud detection, model enhancement. These are all very real use cases that are practical in our sites, and we've got reasonable confidence that we can go at them.

So you'll start to see -- in the Reimagine the Bank effort, there's an overlay of tech spend in addition to our run rate tech spend we're spending on the franchise that will be principally pointed at AI deployment for Reimagine the Bank. So we're carving out a meaningful chunk of overlay for tech spend that will wind up in our depreciation line over time, which is incorporated in our guide relative to the net benefits of Reimagine the Bank.

Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.

Gerard Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Bruce, since going public, you've done a very good job of delivering on growing this organization that you head up. And clearly, you've done it in this Wealth Management area, most recently in the Private Bank. Can you guys share with us the growth that you're planning for this year, the $16 billion to $20 billion of client assets, how much is that coming from existing customers of their portfolios versus just new customers coming in with -- you're going to maybe hire more teams? And then I don't know if you can parse how much of a benefit has this 3-year bull market been on this business?

Bruce Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. I'm going to flip this to Brendan quickly. But what I would say is that what you're seeing on that Private Bank slide is simply the growth of $6 billion to $10 billion in kind of this -- kind of lift-out venue that's serving their Private Bank partners. And some of that comes from the continued acquisition of new teams, but the majority is going to come from just the kind of people that are on the platform kind of getting their full book converted in and then growing as they start to serve the Private Bank and Private Wealth. So that's part of the story.

Beyond that, not shown on this page, we have our branch-based business that is going exceptionally well. And then we have Clarfeld, which was a legacy RIA that we acquired, which is working closely with the Private Bank at this point. But when you add that all together, the kind of AUM, kind of assets that we have in -- what we refer to as client assets, which includes transactional balances is about $60 billion and the kind of core AUM of that is about half of that.

And so that now is a number that's growing very nicely across kind of all those 3 sectors. So we have the Private Bank growing. We're finding an ability to rejuvenate Clarfeld growth and then the branch business is running very, very nicely and achieving strong growth. So we're excited that, that Wealth fee line can continue to hit new records kind of quarter after quarter as it did in 2025.

Brendan, you can provide more color.

Brendan Coughlin
President & Vice Chair

Yes, sounds good. On the private -- I'll unpack both of them very quickly. On the private banking side, just one strategic point to make. It's hard to totally separate the adding of new talent from the referrals coming from the banking teams that we hired because you need them both in place for either of them to happen. And once you get the new talent in, it is true that 80% to 90% of their previous book will follow them over, and we have seen that, and we've actually seen better performance than that on most of our teams that we've lifted out. But they also have new productivity. They're bringing in their own clients on the Wealth side, but then they're referring them back to the bank. So this is a bidirectional referral model.

On the banking side, we have seen an acceleration of referrals as we've got high-quality Wealth teams on through 2025. We expect that to continue into 2026 at a healthy clip. So as the business gets more granular, as we convert some of the business banking clients into personal banking, have the right Wealth teams, we expect a continued acceleration of new business flow coming from that into these new Wealth teams. And we expect -- we've been doing 1 to 2 teams a quarter of new lift-outs. I would expect us to be in that range over the course of 2026 as well. So a supplement of accelerating referrals, adding new teams, new teams bringing their back books plus new teams bringing new business and hitting the market hard.

On the mass affluent front, about 55% of our fee income or our AUM, I should say, is actually in the branch-based business and about 60% of our fee income is from the mass affluent business. So that business grew in 2025 by 15% on the AUM side and 25% on the fee income side. And the effective rate of revenue on the mass affluent business is roughly twice of that of the private bank. So you're getting significant profitability [ jaws ] by growing that business as well. We had record referrals coming from our retail bank. We've had an overhaul of talent in our advisers that sit in the branches. We've grown that adviser base by [ about ] 50 advisers in 2025. We expect that to continue.

So we're seeing sort of all boats rise with a rising tide, the Wealth brand that we're building and the capabilities that we're building are coming through in all the client segments. We're getting a real strong uptick from Don's business as the commercial team has more confidence in the teams that we bring on.

Your comment about the bull market, it is true. Bull market helps. Market betas help. About 1/3 of our private banking revenue uplift was driven by market betas. But you can't capture that market beta unless you acquire the customers to begin with.

So there's a bit of a virtuous circle here that's happening here as we're getting outsized new customer growth, outsized talent growth and catching the market beta as it moves from whatever firm they exited over to Citizens. So we feel really pleased with where we're at, and we expect continued positive momentum across all segments.

Bruce Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Do you have another question, Gerard?

Gerard Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Yes. As a follow-up, taking a step back, Bruce, for a second. Obviously, you've grown the company and you've painted a very strong organic growth picture for this year, but you've grown it successfully through timely acquisitions, whether it was Investors in 2022 or the HSBC branches as well as JMP. When you kind of -- with the regulatory environment being very supportive of consolidation, can you give us your big picture view of how you think shaping up and opportunities for Citizens over the next couple of years?

Bruce Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. I'd say -- and I said this in my opening prepared remarks that right now, we have such great organic growth opportunities that, that's our focus. And so we're not going to run out and knee-jerk. The window is open, it might close. We should try to hunt around and find a deal to do. I think the better course of action here is make sure that the Private Bank stays on its trajectory, and we really make that a sustainable, great business. That, in effect, was our acquisition, when you look at the accretion that's coming from it. We took a risk and took -- spent some start-up capital, and it's working out spectacularly well.

And then Reimagine the Bank is another big effort that is involving many of our top talent across the bank to make that work. And so just from a pure bandwidth standpoint, we want to make sure that these things are hardening and maturing and on their way to success before we kind of step back and think about anything that would be inorganic. There might still be opportunities to do kind of some of the little kind of business line adds that we've done in the past such as an M&A boutique. We have these lift-outs that we're doing, but that's pretty much where our focus will be this year.

Our next question comes from Chris McGratty with KBW.

Christopher McGratty
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

The 16% to 18% back half of next year ROE guide, looking at our numbers and consensus, we're, call it, a little bit closer to 15%. I hear you on the SCB that maybe gets you to 50 basis points. And the combination of revenues, credit expenses probably gets you to the low end. Interested in kind of a gut check on our math. And also to get firmly into the range, is it about the expense growth rate from Reimagine the Bank moderating? Or is it something else?

Bruce Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

No, I'd say, again, we think we can hit -- get into that low end of that range kind of by the end of the year. It's not a full year forecast for '27, just to be clear. And then when we look out to the next year in '28, that's when we can fully deliver that. So we're on the journey. We think we made some strides this year. I think the acceleration, again -- do the math on what the EPS growth is and it's very significant based on this guide. That will make another big step forward in '26 in that ROTCE performance. And then we tend to peak in the fourth quarter of every year, it tends to be a very seasonally high year.

So our -- like just like this year, we were above the year average with a 12.2% exit rate. In '26, we'll end up -- the fourth quarter will be a higher number than our year average and then '27 kind of the same thing. So we see a path to getting there. And I think it's really just driving these initiatives, having the NIM continue to expand, everything that we put in our guide.

Christopher McGratty
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Great. And then just a quick follow-up on reserves. I hear you on the moderating credit costs. If we compare the reserves adjusted for the balance sheet optimization, I guess, where are we relative to CECL day 1?

Bruce Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. There's a number of things. We had the non-core rundown. We had some loan sales within student. And then we did the Investors acquisition. So like there's a whole series and then a lot of BSO. But I think, Aunoy, correct me if I'm wrong, I think it's about 110-ish would be the CECL day 1. So it actually was mid-40s, 45 or so, the original CECL day 1.

But the things that we talk about is really having a very disciplined risk appetite and continuing to improve the overall credit risk profile. We brought that 145 back down to about 110. And so to have -- to be in the low 150s at this point still shows a fair amount of conservatism and a very healthy level of reserves.

Our last question comes from Ken Usdin with Autonomous Research.

Kenneth Usdin
Bernstein Autonomous LLP

I apologize for just one quick one. Just bringing everything together on the Private Bank, you guys continue to point out Slide 24, the impact of the Private Bank on overall expense growth. So 1.8% of the 4.5-ish this year. To your points about where growth is and where growth comes from, do we get through this year and get to kind of a lower natural growth incremental rate from the Private Bank? Or do you just kind of see what the opportunity set is as you look further out and potentially then move that to other potential investments?

Bruce Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

I think there's still more build for the Private Bank. And the other thing I would say, Ken, is not only do we have a very robust total revenue growth outlook for '26, we have a similarly robust output -- outlook for '27. So when you think about -- if you're growing your top line around 10% and you grow your expenses at 4.5%, you're delivering massive positive operating leverage. And the good news there is these are very prudent targeted investments in terms of building a great private banking franchise, continuing to strengthen and invest in the commercial bank in these expansion markets and how we're covering private capital.

And so that seems appropriate to us that we can kind of have our cake and eat it too, as long as this really strong revenue outlook continues, and you can deliver big positive operating leverage, big growth in EPS every year, big improvement in ROTCE and you're not shorting the pot and playing small ball. You're actually continuing to think about ways to grow your business and grow your franchises so that you have a medium term that continues to have a very positive outlook. So that's how we think about it.

Okay. All right. I think that's all the questions that we have in the queue. So thanks for dialing in today. We really appreciate your interest and your support. Go out and have a great day. Thank you.
