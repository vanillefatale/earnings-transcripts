[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler.

Michael Lavery
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

You touched on some of the cost expectations and how the T&M initiatives would be continuing and some of the other administrative savings. But could you maybe just unpack guidance a little bit further and give us some of the key puts and takes to keep in mind and just how to think about peeling that onion a little bit further?

Jeffrey Ettinger
Interim CEO & Director

Sure, Michael. Thank you very much. This is Jeff Ettinger answering. So we'll start on the top line, where we said we expect organic net sales growth of 1% to 4%. We already have substantial momentum on top line and with all 4 quarters last year generating top line growth and driven by all 3 segments and expect that kind of momentum to continue.

As John described, we think our protein-centric portfolio, coupled with our presence in both Retail and Foodservice puts us in an advantaged strategic position. In terms of other specifics that will help the top line in fiscal 2026, we'll be benefiting from the pricing actions that have already been taken place, but some of which kind of roll in, in Q1 or at the very beginning of Q2. And then we also will have enhanced marketing support, and we've been on air already supporting many of our key brands.

When it comes to the bottom line, we've guided to adjusted operating income growth of 4% to 10% with a midpoint of a 7% growth in fiscal 2026. We have taken several steps to help our bottom line performance catch up with our top line momentum. So first of all, there is that pricing flow through, which will better match up with costs as the year goes on. Secondly, we expect to drive mix improvement, and the marketing focus will help us to do that. Third, we do expect continued benefits from the T&M program. Fourth, we have the savings from the restructuring work, and I'm sure we'll be able to provide more details about that in further questions on the call here this morning. And then lastly, we do expect some relief from pork costs in -- particularly in the second half of the year, although we're still facing some headwinds in beef and nut costs.

So overall, I mean -- I guess our theme is we believe our guidance is realistic and achievable and demonstrates the value of our balanced protein-centric portfolio.

Michael Lavery
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

That's helpful. Great color. And can I just add a follow-up on portfolio reshaping you touched on in the prepared remarks and gave a couple of examples. It sounds like is that more of a starting point and that you would be doing a bit more review there? Or how would you sort of assess maybe some of what you've just announced versus what may still be to come?

John Ghingo
President & Director

Michael, this is John. I'll take that question. So thank you. Yes, portfolio reshaping certainly is an ongoing effort for us, and it's a strategic one. We continue to look at strategic categories and brands and making sure we're building our portfolio around our growth ambitions. And also importantly, looking at how do we simplify our operations. Really, all of it is about positioning Hormel for sustainable long-term growth. So if you think about simplifying operations, that includes exiting nonstrategic businesses and ensuring we have the best owner for our brands and product lines.

The example I mentioned earlier around Justin's, Justin's is a wonderful brand, but a better fit in the hands of the strategic partnership that we've created. Given its overall size, the opportunity it has for growth in confections, which is a nonstrategic category for us, was an opportunity that we saw. So I would say, overall, our actions reflect a deliberate strategy around portfolio shaping, all intended to streamline and position our company for sustainable profitable growth and allowing us to really focus on that premise I mentioned, which is nourishing protein solutions.

Your next question comes from the line of Tom Palmer from JPMorgan.

Thomas Palmer
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Jeff, in the prepared remarks, you said you expect stronger turkey markets in your guidance. I just wanted to clarify around that since there are several turkey products you sell including ground turkey, where there was some pricing midyear and then deli meat. What are you assuming in the outlook for whole bird pricing? Spot price is obviously up quite a bit. But I think you still have contracting to finalize over the coming quarters. So I think at times, you guys have indicated it might be too early to embed much change in guidance until you start to capture it in contracts.

John Ghingo
President & Director

Okay. So this is John. Tom, I'll jump in on that one and just talk turkey a little bit. I'll kind of pull back overall on turkey in general for us and kind of come down to some of the areas you're touching on.

So first, Turkey continues to be a very important business for us, very important for the consumer. And in particular, our focus around value-added turkey, ground turkey continues to be a winning formula for us. From a consumer demand standpoint, ground turkey, in particular, is a great option for consumers, very versatile, plugs in very well to everyday life, different food experiences, different meal experiences. So in terms of creating value in a strained consumer environment, we love our ground turkey business.

Second, I'll comment that there certainly has been some volatility in the markets and the industry. You'll recall that in 2025, we saw a run-up in costs in the first half of the year around turkey. In our supply chain, we said we needed to take price. We did that. We implemented pricing actions in the back half based on that inflation that we saw. We actually weathered that pricing well on our ground turkey business, driving both top line growth, market share improvements and profit recovery. So we're managing the volatility well, I would say, coming from a position of strength with Jennie-O as we support the brand well, serve our customers well is absolutely critical. That being said, the markets have continued to fluctuate, certainly, that does impact our pricing.

And coming to your point around whole birds in particular, I would say, our guidance, our expectations for the year include somewhat elevated whole bird prices throughout the year. Although I will point out to your question, it's early and very little is settled at this point in terms of the market. We still need to see sell-through from this holiday season as one factor in that. So that's the position of where we're at now. And again, from an overall standpoint, we love the turkey business. Consumers looking for lean protein, our ground turkey business continues to be a winning business for us that we're going to drive.

Thomas Palmer
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. And then maybe this question will catch you off guard. But I wonder if you might share a bit of the expected savings from your restructuring work.

Jeffrey Ettinger
Interim CEO & Director

This is Jeff. I didn't answer your last question. So I owe you this one, right? So as we talked about, we made the difficult but responsible decision to reduce expenses, ultimately resulting in a 250 position workforce reduction, which is about 9% of our corporate and sales group.

Significantly, the other aspect of this what -- that we focused on was really making sure we had the right organizational structure going forward. We were able to reduce layers in many areas, and we also targeted expenses, including certain benefit programs. This work has resulted in meaningful savings and will free up capacity for growth objectives and our company initiatives.

We designed the program to deliver gross savings in the range of 2 to 3x our expected cost to implement, and we expect that the payback timing will be quick within the first 12 months, although in terms of quarterly cadence, it doesn't really kick until the beginning of the calendar year. So the first 2 periods of Q1 really don't have this benefit. I also want to point out that you won't see all of this flow through as a direct reduction in SG&A because some of these gross savings are being reinvested in people and brands and technology. Some of the benefit actually gets reflected in cost of goods instead of SG&A and some will cover incentive resets.

Let me also pass over to Paul to give you a little more specific for modeling purposes.

Paul Kuehneman
Interim Chief Financial Officer & Controller

Yes. Great. Thanks, Jeff. All in, the work we've done for SG&A has allowed us to anticipate adjusted SG&A as a percent of net sales comparable to the prior year, inclusive of meaningful step-up in marketing and advertising investments. Maintaining prior year rates of spending while reallocating resources to what will drive our brands and company forward in the best way is an important lever to our growth story for fiscal '26 and beyond.

Your next question comes from the line of Ben Theurer from Barclays.

Benjamin Theurer
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

A lot to digest literally, but I wanted to go back into some of the comments and the outlook, more particular as it relates to Planters. So obviously, you've taken some decisions within the nut business on the private label side. But I just wanted to understand where you are in terms of the journey of recovering on Planters of what you've lost, in terms of where are you in shelf space? Where are you on the profit side? Just to understand how we should think about the cadence into fiscal '26 of further delivering from the Planters business. That would be my first question.

John Ghingo
President & Director

Great, Ben. I'll take it. It's John. Yes, Planters continues to be a very important brand for us in our portfolio, and we are very bullish overall on Planters going forward. Last quarter, I mentioned that we had started growing Planters again. And now I'm very pleased to say that we are fully back in growth mode behind Planters. And I mean that both in the near term as well as in the potential we see for Planters in the longer term.

So when I talk about the near term, we are clearly delivering the gains we expected to see in the marketplace. I'm pleased to report that in the latest 13 weeks of consumption data, we've seen Planters plus 12% in dollar consumption and plus 6% in volume consumption versus prior year. This is largely, to your point, driven by distribution gains. Distribution is up 13% versus prior year in the latest 13 weeks and base sales are up over 10%. So the specific question around distribution, our distribution recovery is just about complete at this point. We are nearly all the way back to where we were prior to the supply disruption, and we are gaining share in the growing snack nut category.

I also mentioned last quarter that our top line momentum is good, our consumer recovery is on track, but our profit recovery has been somewhat hampered. That continues primarily driven by mix shifts related to consumers trading out of cashews. You may recall that last year, cashews saw significant price increases that were precipitated by commodity inflation. We love the fact that we have a brand and an equity with the Planters franchise that's big enough to keep all those consumers in the franchise as they trade among nut types, but that does drive some mix implications for us from a profitability standpoint.

So as we go forward, we'll continue to build on that top line momentum. We are going to begin lapping that cashew pricing in the second quarter of 2026. And we are adjusting our go-to-market plans to take advantage of our broad portfolio, to drive more favorable mix. And we continue to focus on our 3-part plan that we've talked about before, attracting consumers to the brand, stepped-up communications and advertising, strong in-store promotions, increased focus on our exciting innovation that's proven to be highly incremental to the brand and the category. And we just continue to love Planters as a snacking platform. As consumers are migrating to snacks with substance, snacks with protein, we love the fact that we have this leading brand in that space.

Benjamin Theurer
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Perfect. And then second, I mean, obviously, you've done a lot. We had some impairment charges within your International business, which you've highlighted was Indonesia related. But within International, you called out the dynamics in Brazil, the challenges down there. So we know it was a venture. It was a relatively small business. But given some of the initiatives you're doing in terms of portfolio review, we've seen the Justin's thing. I mean there's a lot just going on.

So how should we think about that venture in Brazil. Is that still part of you want to be there? Or is that something you would be open to put up for sale to literally have an even cleaner story maybe on the International business with more of a focus in Southeast Asia, Asia and not so much with the venture as well in Brazil that has been causing, I guess, more headache than smiles? So just your takes on Brazil, that would be appreciated.

John Ghingo
President & Director

Yes. Sure, Ben. It's John. I'll take that one, too. Look, I would say just a couple of general comments about our International business. Number one, our China business does continue to perform very well for us. That is a strategic priority. It's a focus. Two, we have seen good success on our branded export business headlined by global SPAM. That continues to do very well for us.

To the question around what's held us back, certainly, there are parts of the export business in terms of more commodity-type products that have been more of a struggle recently. And then Brazil, for sure, has been a drag in terms of our overall performance. To come to your question around portfolio, certainly, my earlier comments where everything is under review, we do continue to look at our portfolio in total for what makes sense, what doesn't. And we'll continue that process as we go through 2026.

Your next question comes from the line of Heather Jones from Heather Jones Research.

Heather Jones
Heather Jones Research LLC

I guess I wanted to start with the assumptions on raw material input costs, specifically pork. So it seems like the recovery and productivity for the industry from disease is trending above expectations, and we're set up for decent supply growth in '26. So I was just trying to get a sense of you said above the 5-year average, but below '25. But I was just wondering if you could give us a little more detail as far as like how you're thinking about the year-on-year decline in raw materials, particularly given how much bellies and trim have already retrenched from the summer highs.

Paul Kuehneman
Interim Chief Financial Officer & Controller

Yes. Thanks, Heather. This is Paul. The first quarter has begun, pork trim and beef remain at a headwind year-over-year like you mentioned. We have started to see some year-over-year relief in bellies. We have announced also targeting pricing actions to address the markets. In Foodservice, there's no changes to our pricing. We do have beef and nut headwinds as we look at the full year of fiscal '26 in our guidance. And then to your point, improving pork benefits in half 2 is kind of what we've modeled internally.

Jeffrey Ettinger
Interim CEO & Director

If I could add, Heather, this is Jeff. Just kind of further response to your question. There's modeling for the whole year that obviously we need to do. But one of the things I think we've realized over the last 3 to 4 months is we really need to be more real-time responsive to changes in the market. So in response to this heightened market volatility, we're refining some of our processes to drive greater agility and forecasting and managing commodity risk.

One example would be we're going to couple our external forecasting sources with some of our real-time internal knowledge about factors affecting the commodity markets. So we can predict what we think will happen in H2 and how much recovery there is, but we need to be better than reacting to what really goes on.

Heather Jones
Heather Jones Research LLC

That's helpful. My second question is just you have a number of tailwinds going into '26, whether it be potentially lower raw material cost in pork, the turkey markets, the lapping of nonrecurring things. And you mentioned the headwinds of beef and nuts, and you're going to raise your advertising spend.

But just wondering, as you were putting together your guidance and all, just if you could give us a sense of how much the consumer environment factored into your outlook? Like are you assuming a still tough consumer all the way through '26? Or just how are you thinking about Foodservice traffic? And just -- I know it's a really big question but just trying to get a better sense on how you're thinking about demand.

Jeffrey Ettinger
Interim CEO & Director

It's so big, Heather. It's going to take 2 of us to answer. So I'll start, it's Jeff, and then John will talk about the consumer.

I do want to give a little more color to all of you on the call today about cadence. So we do expect Q1 earnings to be pressured still compared to last year, and we're actually looking at probably $0.02 to $0.04 below a year ago as a realistic range because we still have spillover effects on the bottom line in terms of the pricing actions, they are not all fully implemented in Q1. In terms of the commodity input costs, as you correctly point out, they started to come down, but they do remain elevated. We have some turkey supply issues still from the turkey illness issues.

As I mentioned a minute ago, we have the timing of the SG&A benefit, which will help us through the year, but not particularly in Q1. So although we expect Q1 earnings to be pressured compared to last year, we then are confident in our growth guide for the remainder of the year. But it does pull down the full year in terms of how that factors in.

On the consumer side, John?

John Ghingo
President & Director

Yes. So -- thanks, Heather. I'll talk a little bit. I mean, I think the consumer environment, I would still say the consumer is quite strained, feeling the cumulative effects of inflation, feeling some of the uncertainty in the macro environment, consumer sentiment remains quite low. So as we look out to 2026, I mean, we are factoring that into our guidance, meaning we expect the consumer to continue to exhibit value-seeking behavior throughout the year. We believe our portfolio is well positioned to provide value in a number of different ways.

From a Foodservice perspective, aligned with external forecasts, we expect flat to little growth in the foodservice industry in total. But again, we love our solutions-based portfolio. We love our Foodservice model in terms of the channel diversification we have across small and large, across different types of channels, across commercial and noncommercial. So we love our channel resilience. We love our direct sales force. We love the types of solutions we provide to operators who value our partnership even in difficult times when traffic is down. So we feel like we have a good set of answers to the challenging environment, but we are modeled and forecasting a continued difficult environment from a consumer standpoint throughout 2026.

Your next question comes from the line of Pooran Sharma from Stephens.

Pooran Sharma
Stephens Inc., Research Division

I was just wondering if maybe you could give us a sense of kind of how much you're planning to invest back in the business. I know in terms of T&M, and I know you're walking away from giving T&M targets going forward. But what you had given in the past was $75 million in FY '24 and then $100 million to $150 million in FY '25. I was just wondering if you were able to give us a sense of how much of that you were planning to -- you had invested back into the business or just give us a sense of how much reinvestment you're planning to drive back into the business?

Jeffrey Ettinger
Interim CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks for the question, Pooran. I think, again, I'll -- this is Jeff, and I'll start and John will conclude on your question.

So I do want to point out on T&M. So this is the final year of our current program. It doesn't mean we've made any permanent decisions about where we go from here. And it really has played a critical role and delivered significant value to the company. We have continued efforts scheduled for this year, a number of specific projects. But we have found that breaking out the financial benefits separately seems like it hasn't been particularly helpful and, in some cases, has caused confusion. So we're not providing that breakout, but we do expect to see financial benefits in 2026. And they'll kind of be spread between the marketing enhancement that you're asking about. We're also going to use some to offset continued inflationary pressure and then hopefully to allow us to expand margins.

I'll hand it over to John then.

John Ghingo
President & Director

Yes. So in terms of how we're thinking about that reinvestment behind our brands, we're spending largely in a concentrated way behind our focus brands. There's a couple of points to that. One is, think about our brands like Planters, SPAM, Jennie-O as well as critical innovation that we know is important in the market to deliver that value for consumers right now. Driving our investments behind those brands is one of the levers we have to drive positive mix into 2026 and create some of that margin momentum. Second, I will say on those businesses, we do have a very good handle and analytics around return on investment behind those marketing investments.

And most importantly, at this moment is it's absolutely critical that we support our brands through the pricing. We know that the consumer is strained. We know that we've taken multiple waves of pricing that we've talked about. It's inflation-justified pricing, it's needed, but the consumer is strained. And so our ability to support our brands well through those pricing actions is actually for us proven to be the recipe for success to successfully implement those pricing actions and to be able to continue the category and brand momentum we want to see. So that's how we're thinking about our stepped-up investment into 2026.

Pooran Sharma
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Great. Great. Appreciate the color there. On the follow-up, I was maybe just hoping to dive into cadence, just a tad bit further. I appreciate the color you just gave on 1Q. And just thinking about 2 through 4Q and the recovery in FY '26. Is it more of like a gradual recovery where you're going to see a sequential recovery quarter-to-quarter from 2Q to 4Q? Or is it more of kind of like a step-up in the back half and just a little bit of recovery in 2Q? If you're able to just provide any color around that would be helpful.

Jeffrey Ettinger
Interim CEO & Director

Sure. Thanks, Pooran. This is Jeff again. Yes, we do expect after the first quarter challenges to see an acceleration of benefit. Realistically, as you get to Q4, you're now against a quarter that, as we talked about, had $0.03 of onetime incidents. And so that clearly should be a more beneficial quarter. So the middle ones will be more modest increases and then Q4 should be more substantial.

Your next question comes from the line of Leah Jordan from Goldman Sachs.

Leah Jordan
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I just wanted to go back and dig in a little bit more on Heather's second question. Given the fact that you're planning for revenue growth in each of your segments next year, just see if you could talk more about the drivers between price and volume for each segment. I mean we've got some pricing in Retail, but there's maybe some lower cost that will come through in the back half. And we've got the quicker pass-through on Foodservice. So just how should we think about those elements in the mix of a more challenged consumer environment?

Paul Kuehneman
Interim Chief Financial Officer & Controller

This is Paul. So on the segment detailed guide, all in for fiscal '26, we expect Retail to have modest declines in volume with low single-digit increases in net sales. Foodservice will have low single-digit increases in volume with net sales in the mid-single digits. And then International also expecting low single-digit increases in volume with high single-digit increases in net sales. And as Jeff has stated, segment profit growth by all 3 segments for the course of the year.

Leah Jordan
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. And then maybe just some comments around the competitive overall across your categories in Retail. I mean what are you seeing from peers as you start to put through some targeted pricing in some areas? And then -- but you're also kind of planning for incremental brand investments as well. So just the competitive environment overall.

John Ghingo
President & Director

Yes, sure. I can take that. This is John. From a Retail perspective, we do feel very good about the top line momentum we're seeing across the Retail business despite what is a choppy and competitive environment and that strained consumer backdrop. When you look at the drivers underneath that consumption performance, you can see in the scanner data, our flagship and rising brands continue to perform well. In the latest 13 weeks, they were up 3.7% versus last year. That carried our total Hormel portfolio to over 1% consumption growth in the latest 13 weeks.

Some of the standout performers, Jennie-O ground turkey, where we're up double digits, we're certainly pacing ahead of the competition. Planters back to double-digit growth, also pacing ahead of the competition. We're seeing good strong growth in our rising Mexican brands, Wholly Guacamole and Herdez grew 7% and 5%, respectively. Applegate continues to grow. So we like our portfolio. We like the momentum we have on Retail.

We have taken, as we've talked about, multiple waves of pricing action. We -- in the last quarter call, we talked about that we had announced a wave of pricing, that we were going to monitor if we needed additional pricing. As we got deeper into the quarter and saw the markets continue to rise, we did, in fact, announce another wave of pricing, which largely will benefit us in the second quarter.

To your point around how do we maintain that momentum, how do we feel competitively? We're going to continue to invest in our brands. We're going to continue to invest behind our core brands as well as our innovation to weather that competitively. And all in all, we certainly see competitive activity in some of the categories that is aggressive, but we feel like we have good, differentiated positions. We know where our growth is needed to come from, and we're going to continue to invest in those spots.

Your next question comes from the line of Max Gumport from BNP Paribas.

Max Andrew Gumport
BNP Paribas, Research Division

I was hoping for an update on tariffs, particularly if there are any expenses, particularly such as those associated with cashews that you incurred in FY '25 that might not repeat in FY '26 due to recent exemptions? And then if so, if you could quantify that impact for us?

Paul Kuehneman
Interim Chief Financial Officer & Controller

Yes, Max, this is Paul. Thanks for the question. Overall, a message on tariffs. Really, we feel that we're fairly insulated. Obviously, the global environment remains dynamic and it's ever changing. For '26, the range that we think that we'll have on tariffs is $25 million to $35 million, and it's mainly related to supplies in steel and aluminum.

Obviously, we were watching cashews until the recent announcements of the removal of reciprocal tariffs. We haven't really quantified that exact amount that we had in '25 to give you a range on the '26 question.

Max Andrew Gumport
BNP Paribas, Research Division

Okay. I think that $25 million to $35 million, is that roughly in line with the total tariffs that you saw on your P&L in '25 then? I think you had quantified a $0.01 to $0.02 impact, I believe, in the second half of '25.

Paul Kuehneman
Interim Chief Financial Officer & Controller

Yes. So on a full year basis, that is correct.

Max Andrew Gumport
BNP Paribas, Research Division

Okay. Great. Then that takes me to my second question, which would be -- I mean I still think there's plenty of discrete items you have in fiscal year '26, that will be a help to your profit growth. So you've mentioned admin savings. I think you said it was 2 to 3x the cost to implement, which I think is $20 million to $25 million the cost to implement, but correct me if that's wrong. But if that's right, that would be, maybe at the midpoint, roughly $60 million in savings, not all of that is going to flow to the bottom line. Some of it gets invested, but let's assume half flows to the bottom line, that's $30 million in profit growth. You've got the chicken recalls that you're lapping, the fire at the Little Rock facility that you're lapping. So that's another $20 million or so in profit growth. So now we're at $50 million of profit growth. Your guidance is for $40 million to $100 million. And we've also got a benefit coming from T&M, again, some of which gets reinvested, but some of which flows to the bottom line and then whole bird turkey pricing.

So I was hoping just to get a bit more color on sort of what's -- what am I missing? What's dragging you down? Is it other forms of inflation like on beef and nuts? Just one -- just given these discrete factors, I'm trying to get a better sense for what might be holding you back and sort of keeping the low end of the range at 4% EBIT growth.

Jeffrey Ettinger
Interim CEO & Director

All right. I'll start, Max, this is Jeff. I mean -- you're correct that the $20 million to $25 million number in terms of the onetime cost is what we've reported. And so your math of the 2 to 3x works in that regard. And you correctly pointed out that, that ends up being the total available savings, but then we are going to be reinvesting parts of it in certain areas.

I think a couple of other factors that we probably could point out to you that might mitigate your math a little bit. One, I'll remind you again about Q1. So we start out the year in somewhat of a hole. So the implied rest of the year is quite a bit higher than 7% then. And so that does factor in some of the advantages that you're citing.

Secondly, I mean, I think the other thing that maybe models miss that we've talked about in the past is in the pricing area that while we're in a reasonably good position to be current to the cost on the Foodservice side with some lag. In Retail, it's a more complex decision, and there are cases where, okay, if we're -- yes, the costs are up this much, but if we price to that same equivalent amount, it's going to really harm the long-term future of the brand. There are times where we've chosen not to do that. And so some of the math factoring into how we think '26 plays out has that factored in as well.

Your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer.

Erica Eiler
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

This is Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. So I wanted to dive a little bit deeper into gross margin. So obviously, under pressure here in Q4 because of some of those discrete items. But maybe you could just walk us through some of the high-level puts and takes, how you're thinking about gross margins for the year? Maybe -- and in terms of cadence, how we should think about the recovery there?

Paul Kuehneman
Interim Chief Financial Officer & Controller

So when you think about the gross margins for the year, I think obviously, we've got -- in '25, like you mentioned, we obviously had impacted by the commodity inflation with 500 bps year-over-year in Q4 alone. The chicken product recall and the Little Rock fire obviously drove that as well. Planters top line is performing well. But as we said last quarter, we're balancing the mix dynamics on profitability. So those are really the margin dynamics in '25.

As we look in '26, we obviously got gross margin expansion with mix improvements. A lot of pricing flow through over the course of the year in different waves that John has already described on the call here. And then we've got T&M savings going forward as well in the final year of the Transform and Modernize project.

Erica Eiler
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then just on inventory. So I think inventory was up about 11% in the quarter. Just curious how you're feeling about the health of your inventory from here?

Paul Kuehneman
Interim Chief Financial Officer & Controller

Yes. A great question, Erica. Overall, we feel very comfortable with our inventory levels. And as you note, they are up year-over-year, but they actually went down in the fourth quarter. The biggest driver of that increase in inventory is the commodity markets that are boosting the balances. And then we made strategic decisions on pounds to increase for the center store business for the colder months and weather events. And then lapping last year, we also had the Planters issue in the Suffolk plant, and so we've got a replenishment there. But overall, we feel very comfortable with where our inventory levels are today.

Your last question comes from the line of Yasmine Deswandhy from Bank of America.

Yasmine Deswandhy
BofA Securities, Research Division

Can I just ask on turkey specifically. So we know that turkey was a $0.25 headwind to fiscal '23 and then roughly a $0.15 headwind to fiscal '24. So could you just help us bridge the '25 impact? So what was the full year turkey headwind or tailwind to earnings in '25?

John Ghingo
President & Director

Just to give you a little bit of color on turkey. So I mean, in general, we saw a lot of, I'll say, increased costs in turkey in 2025. We were able to land on our ground turkey business, the pricing we needed to, to cover that in terms of how that played out for the year. Those first half pressures really hit us quite hard, and we were able to balance that back in the second half and offset those first half headwinds with the improved results in the back half.

In terms of whole birds, they did come in somewhat better than expected compared to our original outlook from fiscal 2025. But it was obviously a very, I'll call it, volatile year on turkey. And we weathered it quite well from a competitive standpoint and the recovery in the back half of the year. All in, it was a benefit in 2025.

Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then on raw materials inflation, you had said last earnings that, I think, 3Q was roughly 400 bps. How much was it in 4Q? And how should we think about it in '26 on a quarterly basis, given there's typically some seasonality there?

Paul Kuehneman
Interim Chief Financial Officer & Controller

Yes. Thanks, Yasmine, for your question. In quarter 4 was a 500 basis points of raw material cost inflation during the fourth quarter. For the second part of the question, I direct you to Jess and having more internal discussions there.

There are no further questions at this time -- we have no further questions at this time. So I'll turn the call back to Jeff Ettinger for closing comments. Sir, please go ahead.
