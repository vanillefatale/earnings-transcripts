[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs.

Gabriela Borges
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Congratulations on a -- really exciting 2026 preliminary forecast. Paddy and Matt, I want to ask you about the multiple 8-figure committed contracts that you're talking about. Tell us a little bit about this cohort of customers. To what extent does it overlap with some of the AI revenue that you're talking about? I know you've been working with the private equity community as well.

You've talked about migration. So maybe just a little bit about the type of customer that's signing the 8-figure contract and the extent to which I know in the past, the AI cohort has been much more flaky in its ability to ramp up and down. And so I'm trying to understand the intersection between those 2 cohorts.

Padmanabhan Srinivasan
CEO & Director

Yes. Thank you, Gabriela. Great questions. So the 8-figure commitment contracts that we just talked about come in different forms. Primarily, these are AI native companies that are looking to take advantage of our infrastructure as well as the other customer that I was just talking about for our AI platform, looking to build a series of agentic experiences for software engineering, taking advantage of our Gradient AI platform layer.

So it's a combination of all of these. And as I was explaining in my prepared remarks, it is increasingly getting difficult to just separate out where AI starts and stops and where core cloud begins because most of the customers that are starting their experience with DigitalOcean from the AI side are increasingly using our various storage artifacts like network file system or the VPC capabilities or a number of the networking capabilities and things like that.

So the crossover is becoming more and more between the AI side of our platform and cloud. So that's why we are now starting to see a more unified cloud platform from us, which we are calling as the agentic cloud. So a lot of these commitments and contracts that we are starting to take on now typically start with AI, but also spill over to our AI cloud side as well.

So what is exciting for us is that some of these customers start their journey with DO using a fairly small proof-of-concept type of footprint, and now they're starting to scale. And this is also one of the many reasons why we are expanding our data center footprint so that we can keep scaling with these customers. And the other attribute I want to call out here is that these AI workloads are predominantly inferencing, if not all, on the inferencing side.

So it is durable, it is predictable. And we also have a great opportunity to keep scaling with these customers as they find real-world traction and scale globally. So that's why it is really important for us to start looking at our capacity as we place bets on some of these real marquee AI native companies that are finding traction with real end customers, both on the consumer side as well as on the enterprise side.

Your next question comes from the line of Radi Sultan with UBS.

Radi Sultan
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Good to see the platform traction coming in ahead of schedule. I guess for me, just AWS and Azure both had some pretty high-profile outages recently. I'm just curious, like is that having any near-term impact or catalyzing more migrations from the hyperscalers that driving more traction for Partner Network Connect or some of your other multi-cloud offerings? And then just curious how many of those 8-figure deals are migrations from the hyperscalers?

Padmanabhan Srinivasan
CEO & Director

Yes. Thank you, Radi, for the question. So we've been seeing a steady increase in migration workloads since we made it into an explicit go-to-market motion. And as you know, migrations of sophisticated workloads is always a combination of factors, right? It tell them, oh, we see a disruption from a cloud provider, and they're just going to move a fairly sophisticated global workload -- but it is a combination of factors. Some are driven by dissatisfaction with an incumbent.

But mostly, it is driven by something they find attractive in a new cloud provider like DigitalOcean. So as we have started building out our cloud capabilities, especially the ones that I described in Slide 12 of our deck, like more advanced networking, various flavors of our droplet configurations, our storage, like cold storage is a really, really important capability that many of our large customers with sophisticated workloads have been asking us for.

The auto-scaling of our DBaaS. I mean these are all very fundamentally building block type of capabilities for attracting more migration workloads, not to mention some of the stuff we did in the last couple of quarters like virtual private cloud and Direct Connect and things like that. So even though a single incident doesn't necessarily precipitate major shifts in workloads, these are all paper cuts and us having these other digital native enterprise-ready capabilities just makes us all the more attractive to incoming migration.

And the AI native workloads typically are new workloads that are starting on our platform, but many of the workloads that we are seeing that I talked about during my prepared remarks on the cloud are migrations coming from various other hyperscaler clouds.

Your next question comes from the line of Josh Breyer with Morgan Stanley.

Josh Baer
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Congrats on the acceleration. I wanted to follow up on the 8-figure contracts signed after quarter close. I guess I'm wondering, do you have capacity to serve some of those in the coming weeks? Or is that all really what the 30 megawatts of new data center capacity is geared toward? And then hoping to get a little sense of like the ramp in that capacity. Basically, any context for the go-live times for these big contracts and like how to think about the shape of 2026?

Padmanabhan Srinivasan
CEO & Director

Yes. So I'll get started, Matt, and then you can chime in. So from the ramp-up perspective, some of these customers are already doing business with us. And as we think about the capacity, there's some capacity we are bringing online in our existing data centers. And then, of course, a lot of the visibility that we now have with these customers and their inference scale-up is the reason why we have taken up expanded data center capacity.

And these data centers will come online progressively through 2026, right? So we do have a build schedule from these providers, and we work very, very closely with them to make sure that we get the warm shell and then we move in and we start racking our servers, and there's a lot of moving parts in terms of bringing this capacity online, but we don't have to wait for this new capacity to start lighting up these workloads.

As I said, we do have some capacity in our existing data centers. So it is a combination of these things. And you're absolutely right that this visibility into the inference adoption of our AI native customers is the reason why we are expanding our data center footprint.

Matt Steinfort
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And I'll just add that most of the capacity is going to come online in, call it, the first half of next year. In fact, you'll see in our fourth quarter financials, and this is included in the guidance for the adjusted free cash flow we have for 2025 that we're going to be paying some of the NRCs for some of these build-outs in the fourth quarter.

And so we expect that the capacity will become online in the months and quarters following that. So it will be an early ramp of the data center capacity, but then clearly, you have incremental time to deploy the GPUs and for the customers to ramp. So we expect the revenue ramp to be relatively smooth over the course of the year, but we'll be bringing on a fair bit of capacity in the first half.

Your next question comes from the line of Kingsley Crane with Canaccord Genuity.

William Kingsley Crane
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

I want to echo my congrats. I'm sure it's gratifying for the team. Look, a larger peer, Neocloud peer has acquired a handful of PaaS capabilities over the past 6 months, including more recently a Python notebook, I think reinforcement learning for agents. What's your take on that? Does it just give credence to your strategy? And how do you see competition evolving as you continue to cater towards customers upmarket?

Padmanabhan Srinivasan
CEO & Director

Yes, Kingsley, thank you for the question. So we -- our approach when we laid out our strategy in April, we start our strategy with a deep understanding of who our customers are and what it would take for us to serve them well.

And of course, that understanding has deepened over the last 6 months as we have started working very, very closely with these customers. In terms of the Python notebook, this has been a capability that we have had for a couple of years now. And some of the storage enhancements that we are seeing in the market is also something that has been long as part of our very rich and deep software stack.

So if you take a step back and think about our strategy, our strategy is now from an AI perspective, targeting AI-native companies that are building real businesses and running models in an inferencing mode. And these are real-world applications that require not just GPU and inferencing capabilities, but they need agentic workflow capabilities. They need storage, databases, authentication, authorization. They need orchestration from a Kubernetes perspective. So essentially, they need a unified agentic cloud stack, which is what we provide. So we have been executing on our strategy.

And if you look at Slide 7, you'll see the richness of the stack that we have built all the way from infrastructure on both cloud and AI to middleware with Platform as a Service or the agentic development life cycle. And Slide 12 shows how much we have enhanced that since just the last earnings call. So we have been super busy and every orange box you see on Slide 12 has been a result of feedback that we are getting from customers real time.

Some of these features have been lit up in just a matter of days. And that is the power of really co-inventing some of these pieces working hand-in-hand with our customers. And I feel building on our strength, which is software differentiation and leveraging the strength of our 12-year-old full-stack general-purpose cloud really puts us in a very favorable position when it comes to being attractive to these scaling AI native companies.

Is hardware a part of it? Absolutely. But we think as companies become more and more sophisticated and they start serving real-world enterprise needs, the center of gravity is going to shift from hardware and networking and move more and more towards the software stack as we have seen in every wave that we have encountered over the last 2 or 3 decades.

So we feel really good about where we are, and we'll be aggressive in adding new functionality into our platform as we start seeing opportunities for those from our customers and in the market.

Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Walravens with Citizens.

Unknown Analyst

Congrats on the quarter. This is Nick on for Pat. Paddy, one for you. You kind of answered this already, but -- are there any other factors that you guys take into account when deciding what to build next? Like you mentioned that it's primarily customer-driven, but are there like competitive positioning? Or how do you balance the idea of what a customer wants with competitive positioning and long-term revenue opportunity, especially in something that could be seen as more experimental?

Padmanabhan Srinivasan
CEO & Director

Yes. Nick, thank you for the question. So just for the avoidance of doubt, we are competitor aware but customer obsessed. So we -- and that strategy has really worked for us, especially in the fast-evolving AI landscape, where we have been very, very disciplined in not chasing the bright shiny training workloads and trying to be somebody that we are not.

But we've been patient, and now we see an opportunity to decisively move to take a full position in the world of inferencing and offer a software platform that combines the raw power of having the best-of-breed flexible AI infrastructure and combine it with where the puck is going, which is there's a whole generation like 20 years of app developed applications that have been developed over the last 20 years will need to be replaced and modernized with agents and agentic workflows.

So managing that whole life cycle is starting to already create a tremendous amount of problems for companies to build, operate and manage. So we think there's a phenomenal opportunity for us to be one of the first movers into the world of agent development life cycle, and that is exactly what we are focused on.

So while it is important to be aware of what our competition is doing, especially the Neoclouds, I feel very confident that we have unmatched software expertise and depth of our platform, as you can see from Slide 7 and 12. So if we keep doing what we are doing, our strategy is resonating with the AI natives, and these are customers that are doubling and tripling their footprint on a month-by-month basis. So if we can keep pace with them and keep shipping at their speed, I think everything else is going to take care of itself.

Your next question comes from the line of James Fish with Piper Sandler.

James Fish
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Nice quarter. Just on the 2026 starting point, kudos on bringing that forward, understanding what's driving the confidence and visibility at this point. But how should we think about the parts underneath between core managed service and AI? And do we still expect that AI business to continue to double given you've done it for 5 straight quarters now?

Matt Steinfort
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Fish. We think that if you look at the success that we're having, it's coming from a combination of things. It's coming from our success with our largest customers, regardless of whether they're AI or core cloud, growing very, very rapidly with the $1 million-plus customers growing 72%.

We think that continues. And a lot of the migration workloads that we've been working on and some of these longer-term committed contracts are also on the core cloud side. So growth of our biggest customers is kind of the lever #1. Lever number two, as you said, is AI growth. It has been doubling every quarter since we launched it, and we're expecting that to continue.

So we're going to get a big chunk of growth from AI. That will become a more material part of our business. It will get into the mid-teens, maybe even high teens as a percent of revenue. And then we're still generating very good incremental revenue from our product-led growth engine. our customers in M1 to M12 are still at very high levels relative to historical. And it's really those 3 levers that give us confidence. And as you said, we have better visibility now than we've ever had.

If you said how many 8-figure committed contracts have we ever had in the company, it's -- I don't know how many, it's not that many. It's maybe 1 or 2. And now we've got multiple that we've signed just in the last month or so. So we're very confident in the 18% to 20% revenue for 2026 and are excited to be able to pull that in a whole year.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos with Needham & Company.

Matthew Calitri
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

This is Matt Calitri on for Mike Cikos over at Needham. Great to see the strength of large deals. I know AI is not included in net dollar retention. But are you thinking about starting to include it as it becomes a larger part of the business and more predictable? And what other puts and takes are you considering as you look to drive NDR back over 100%?

Matt Steinfort
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, it's a great question. We are looking very hard at how to incorporate the resilient growth of inferencing into our metrics. NDR is one metric, and it captures -- it's used a lot in a SaaS environment. It captures the ongoing growth of a customer. To date, we haven't included it in NDR because a lot of the early traction that we were getting and I think a lot of folks were getting in the industry was more project-based and more experimental.

As we're seeing customers like some of the ones that Paddy mentioned like Fal and others, they're bringing scaled workloads to us where they have more predictability in their demand and growth. We believe it's appropriate to start to figure out how to include that. We'll likely revisit this once we get into the beginning of next year, and we have a better sense for the '26 outlook. I mean we're providing more specific guidance.

But what I'd say the key takeaway is the AI revenue that we're seeing now, that we're getting committed contracts for is behaving more like the traditional cloud where customers come in with scaled production workloads and then they have more visibility into the growth of that workload over time, hence, a metric like NDR becomes more relevant. And we're confident that in doing that, that would be additive to our communications of the resilience of the growth that we're seeing.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Zhang with Citigroup.

Mark Zhang
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Maybe just on NDRs, obviously still at the 99%, but we're seeing good expansion momentum and portfolio momentum. So can you maybe just walk through some of the key puts and takes there? And traditionally, I think expansion activity has been in that metric. So can you maybe speak to some of the behaviors there? And any discernible changes in customer behavior versus last quarter or 12 months ago, whether it's on pace of expansion or how they're expanding?

Matt Steinfort
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Mark. It's a great question. The expansion is definitely the driver of the growth. If you look at the big customers, the customers that spend $100,000 or more in ARR and as we showed, it gets better even as you get bigger spenders. They're driving a lot of our growth. And as you would expect, the NDR is better.

The thing that people lose sight of, I think, when they think about the DigitalOcean business is they forget that we have 640,000 plus customers and 450 or so or more 1,000 of those are effectively a paid premium. They're small customers, they spend $10, $15 a month, and many of them stay on for long periods of time. The average age of that cohort is something like 4.5 years.

But you also have a lot of customers come and go. They experiment. I mean so the NDR of that paid premium segment of our customers is below 100. And so that weighs down the overall NDR of the company and it masks the fact that with our largest customers, we're actually seeing very, very strong growth driven by increased expansion.

And that's another follow-up to the question prior to this, that's another metric that we're thinking about is because we're blending this -- where the real growth engine is for the company, we're blending that NDR with the NDR of a giant cohort, which is fantastic for us because it gives us access to a lot of developers. But it's just by its nature, it's going to have like slightly below 100 NDR. We think that's masking a lot of the underlying performance that we're seeing.

Your next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.

Wamsi Mohan
BofA Securities, Research Division

Nice results here. Just given the strong growth trajectory and the confidence, can you just talk about where you think the net of both sort of explicit CapEx plus your equipment leasing, what the sum total of that could be as you look over the next couple of years in dollar terms? And how large could you see that delta growing between adjusted free cash flow and your adjusted unlevered free cash flow margins over the next few years?

Matt Steinfort
Chief Financial Officer

Wamsi, it's a great question. I think, as we said, we're trying to give preliminary guidance for '26 to give the directional kind of growth rates. And we feel very confident that we can deliver that 18% to 20% revenue growth while still delivering the kind of the mid-to-high teens in adjusted free cash flow.

And when I say that number, that's the levered number that I'm referring to. And I think at this point, the market is evolving so fast that it's hard to say what the CapEx would be or what the impact on adjusted free cash flow margin would be even in the second half of next year, much less '27 or beyond. What I can tell you is we -- and you've seen us in terms of our behavior, we didn't chase the training opportunity.

We didn't pursue what we viewed as revenue that we weren't sure how durable that was going to be for us, and we didn't know if we had a competitive differentiation there. But what we said is where we see opportunities to deliver durable revenue growth with a differentiated product that has good returns, that we'll make investments to pursue that.

And you've seen that with our willingness to take down additional data center capacity and secure new GPUs. So I'd say what you can expect is continued disciplined behavior where we're trying to drive durable revenue growth while maintaining an attractive free cash flow margin.

Operator

Your final question comes from the line of Robert Galvin with Stifel.

Robert Galvin
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I wanted to ask about the transition to leveraging leasing and how the gross margins of data centers and equipment you own and operate compare to gross margins from leased capacity.

Matt Steinfort
Chief Financial Officer

Great. So just to clarify there, we don't -- we lease all of our data centers. We're a colocation tenant in each of our data centers. We don't own any. So the taking down of additional data center capacity that we've just referred to will behave the same way that it did when we took down the Atlanta data center earlier this year and when we took down the Sydney data center several years ago.

And what that does is our costs, if you think about our cost of goods, are variable with revenue over the long term. But in the very short term, they're somewhat lumpy. You take down an incremental data center, you have -- not only do you have incremental upfront costs and NRC that happens before you're generating revenue.

But the day you turn on the data center, you start paying for the space and some of the power, then you build it out and kit it out with gear and you fill it up, and it takes some period of time to generate the fully utilized revenue in that facility. So there's always a lump of higher expenses in the beginning when you turn on data center capacity and you grow into it.

And you grow into it over a series of even just a couple of quarters and your gross margin gets back to what's more of a steady-state gross margin. So we expect that to happen in the beginning of next year of 2026. But we've factored that in and incorporated that into our guidance for the year in terms of the free cash flow margins that we expect to generate. So it's just normal course for us. It's nothing different than what we had done previously with respect to the data.
