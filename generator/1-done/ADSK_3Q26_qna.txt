Our first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays.

Saket Kalia
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great to see the better results. Well done. Andrew, maybe to start with you. I'd love to pick up on the theme from Analyst Day a little bit and see if you could just weigh in on sort of the seats versus consumption AI monetization debate for Autodesk. But maybe also as part of that, touch on your broader ecosystem of partners and customers. Does that make sense?

Andrew Anagnost
President, CEO & Director

Yes, that does make sense. And thanks for that question. It's very proposed. So look, there's 3 things we want to pay attention to here. The first one is there's still a fundamental capacity challenge in all the industries we serve, AEC and manufacturing. There isn't enough current capacity to meet all the demand for what needs to be built or the supply chain needs that need to be throughput inside of both manufacturing and AEC. So we have a capacity challenge. The second -- so there's a lot of work that just needed to go to kind of create more capacity.

So the second thing, I think it's really important is, in the future, there's still going to be projects that require intensive human engagement in order to successfully execute. They're going to be more complex. But there's also going to be projects in the future where there's less requirements for human engagement, machines are going to execute more on these things. And there's going to be a balance between these 2. And the last thing is something I've been saying over and over again. Our goal is to decrease the number of people that are working on a particular project, but increase the number of projects that our customers in our ecosystem are executing.

And if you do that, what you're going to see is we're going to be capturing incremental consumption value through the things that we do by monetizing machine-based execution, providing outcomes and all things associated with that, while also still supporting the people-based work that's going to go on the ecosystem. This is equally true of our customers.

Our customers are going to be seeing their balance shift from sometimes, in some cases, billable hours to also consumptive execution through machine-based execution based on their intellectual property and their IP and their unique knowledge set. So we're all in the same journey together, but it's going to play out over time. And you're going to see us actually capturing more value and creating more capacity for the industry we need because the industry desperately needs it.

Saket Kalia
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

That makes a ton of sense and super helpful. Janesh, maybe for my follow-up for you. I appreciate the detailed guide for this year. I was wondering if you were able to just give us any color on fiscal '27 high level as we think about our models.

Janesh Moorjani
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Saket, I'm happy to do that. So let me elaborate a little bit on what I said in the prepared remarks. First off, just by way of context, the business is clearly performing very well this year. That said, we've got a lot of business to close, particularly in January. The second thing I'd point out is our sales and marketing optimization plan has gone very well so far, but we are not complete with that. We touched on this a little bit at Investor Day. So I think there's still some risk of disruption next year.

And then finally, while the macroeconomic indicators have been broadly stable, uncertainty does remain elevated in the environment. So just -- we just think it's best to maintain a prudent posture on our underlying growth for fiscal '27. We are performing very well this year, and we're looking forward to the rest of the year.

Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel.

Adam Borg
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Just on the Autodesk Construction Cloud, it's great to hear the continued traction and even the customer coming over, migrating 700 active projects. When you think about your existing Autodesk Construction Cloud installed base, for those existing customers, how penetrated are you in terms of the projects that are already brought over to Autodesk? Any color around that and the ability to continue selling broader parts of your growing ACC portfolio, be it payments or preconstruction, et cetera, would be really helpful. And then I have a follow-up.

Andrew Anagnost
President, CEO & Director

I really like that question. Okay. So first off, let me just start at the fundamental level, right? The reason why Construction Cloud is doing so well is that we've got this design to preconstruction through construction execution solution. It's completely unique in the industry, and it's built on a modern platform, this is not an aging platform that's going to kind of age out of what people need in the future.

It's a highly connected, AI-ready, SaaS-based platform. That's really a huge selling point for us. And what you just mentioned there, Adam, is completely true as we're acquiring new customers and penetrating new accounts and displacing competitors in lots of accounts, what we're doing is we're starting off with a set of projects. So we're not even fully penetrated in all the projects that we've executed with our customers to date.

I mean, in the accounts where we are with our customers today. So there is actually not only increased penetration that will happen over time within the accounts we have as new projects come and light up and old project sunset, but there's also additional expansion just driven by the power of our value prop.

Adam Borg
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

That's really helpful. And maybe just building on the theme of converges in design and manufacturing. We talked about this a little bit at the Investor Day, but as you think about convergence and the opportunities with Fusion over time, how do you think about the PLM market more broadly for Autodesk.

Andrew Anagnost
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So another great question, right? And I really appreciate it. So first off, remember, we're targeted the mid-market, and that's where there's a lot of growth in supply chain activity. These customers need convergence because they need this end-to-end digital productivity. And I just want to make it super clear to everybody. Most of those customers have nothing with regards to PLM. They don't have anything, all right? They may have a data management solution, they may not. Most of their work is actually done through spreadsheets and ad hoc connectivity with some of their ERP systems.

They don't have any kind of strong data management or life cycle solution. We're building a solution for those customers. And we're going to go in there and say, you can get what the big boys have and you can get the kind of control and the cloud visibility and the cloud data flow that was reserved only to a few, and they need a modern platform. They need a SaaS-based platform. They need what we're bringing with Fusion.

So that's how I look at the market. We built these capabilities in the Fusion. We're going to continue to enhance them. And we're already starting to see success with small accounts of 2 to 3 users expanding to larger accounts because we have these tools that are really hard for a lot of people in the mid-market to get and deploy.

Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities.

Jay Vleeschhouwer
Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division

Andrew, my first question for you is a corollary to the question I asked you a quarter ago about the pace of new technology adoption. And the question has to do with something interesting you said at AU, I think it might have been a main stage, where you said as far as your customer base is concerned, that "no one gets left behind" which is an important general commitment, but what are the practicalities of that in terms of customer migration, packaging, promotions, all those sorts of things that you've done or will need to do with regard to migrating your customers in a way that you implied.

Andrew Anagnost
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So look, we're attacking this from multiple vectors, okay? So first off, packaging is the first one, right? As you know, if you're a collections customer or Revit customer, you get the form of design application shipped with your bundle. So you're already getting something that is you're paying for the future and the present, right? So you're capturing the value right there and you're part of the ecosystem.

The other thing that we're doing is, we're also making sure that we have the CDE available to as many customers as possible. That's form of data management, and we'll talk more about that in the future, which is a really important piece of the puzzle as well. The other thing that's really important, and it needed to get airtime because you're going to see something similar evolve in the Fusion world as well as we talked about Revit is rolling out as the first Forma Connected client next year.

And what that means is what we're doing is we're tightly connecting the workflows between the feature-deep desktop product that customers use today and the evolving emerging product they'll be using tomorrow so that they can seamlessly move between these 2 products in such a way that they can get the benefit of one, while also harnessing simply and easily the benefit of the other.

And that's a really important part of the strategy as we move forward. Because the adoption does take time. It takes time for people to change these things. And we're also hyper focused, especially in the AI side on rolling out features that may not look sexy at the headline level, but are real productivity enhancers for our customers that get real adoption.

What you're seeing with AutoConstrain and Fusion is a great example of that. It's a highly adopted feature. Now explaining it to everybody exactly what it does usually requires a video, but to a customer, they get it, and they love it. They accept these things, like 60% acceptance rates. Some of the these sketches are 90% constrained. It's the kind of stuff that you're going to see us continue to roll out that really makes a difference in how our customers work.

Jay Vleeschhouwer
Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division

Janesh, for you, given the revenue upside across each of the segments, could you comment on any new or incremental trends you're seeing in usage telemetry, either by vertical or geo or a stand-alone product versus collections, anything of that time in terms of the usage component that helped drive some of that growth in AEC, manufacturing and so forth.

Janesh Moorjani
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Jay, thanks. What I'd say is the momentum in Q3 continued from the first half and the trends we saw in Q3 were similar to what we saw in Q2 as well. And you see that strength reflected in the different product lines and the different areas of the business. I touched on some of the areas within AECO, for example, around data centers, infrastructure and industrial that were all bright spots again. And you see that reflected in products as well. Similarly, when you look at the Autodesk Store and some of our emerging geographies that did well, you'll see the trends reflected in those -- the products that get sold in those -- through those routes as well. So overall, I'd say it was very consistent with what we had seen in Q2. Nothing new that I would highlight as an emerging trend.

Our next question comes from the line of Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Jason Celino
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I wanted to ask about the normalized growth you saw this quarter, the 12%, again, similar to last quarter, a slight acceleration. But was there -- like what was the inorganic contribution to that normalized number? I'm just trying to understand if there was some modest acceleration than if there was, what do you think drove that?

Janesh Moorjani
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I'm happy to touch on that. There was nothing unusual with respect to M&A activity in Q3 that affected those underlying growth rates and say, what we saw there was just the continuing momentum that we've seen in the business, as I mentioned just a moment ago, the sources of where that outperformance came from in terms of the upfront revenue, the Autodesk store and stronger billings linearity during the quarter, I think all of those played a role in helping us get to the ultimate outcome that we delivered over here. So overall, it was a strong quarter across the board. The team executed really well, and I think that's what you're seeing reflected in the numbers.

Jason Celino
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. No, that's helpful. And then when we think about the commentary around the EBA cohorts that you have for Q4, I'm just curious what type of behavior you've seen so far from like a renewal standpoint, or if customers are willing to engage earlier. Just curious if you have any tidbits that will be helpful there.

Janesh Moorjani
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Jason, in terms of what we saw in Q3 was very strong engagement from many of those customers. We closed all the business that we were expecting to close. And if I think about some of the typical metrics that we have around attach rates and so forth, those all played out as we expected they would. Q4 is our largest quarter for EBA renewals and we also have a very large product subscriptions renewal cohort to close here in this quarter. Q4 is heavily weighted towards January. So there's still a lot that we need to get done. But again, the team did well here in Q3 and that momentum has continued nicely.

Our next question comes from the line of Taylor McGinnis of UBS.

Taylor McGinnis
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Andrew, first one for you. Just on you mentioned earlier about still some elevated uncertainty out there, but it sounds like you guys are seeing some strength in areas like data centers, industrials and whatnot. When you speak with customers regarding their spending plans across AEC, manufacturing and M&E for calendar 2026 or fiscal year 2027, I guess any early insights that you could share with the group in terms of what you guys are expecting to see?

Andrew Anagnost
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Customers aren't flagging any differences in their spending pattern, all right? I think one of the things that's really, really important to note is, one, the current momentum is going to continue a little bit. And also what the customers are looking for is they're preparing for future productivity enhancements. So everyone is investing in their digital infrastructure [indiscernible] for any changes in the demand patterns, what sector might be more important as we move forward. So most of our customers are flagging a continuation of their investment. Some areas are flagging a little bit more investment because they've been kind of maybe slow on the investment in the past. But we don't see anything changing in terms of the consistency level right there.

Taylor McGinnis
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Perfect. And then, Janesh, maybe just one for you. On billings growth, you made several comments in the prepared remarks just about how growth has been elevated this year because of the new transaction model and also because of the larger base of multiyear billings customers, and we're going to start to lap that going into next year and see some moderation in growth.

So can you just help us unpack the mechanics there a little bit more. So as we look into 2027, could we start to see if we adjust for FX in the new transaction model revenue growth and billings growth start to align with one another? Or is it possible that we could actually see some tougher comps and maybe there's a divergence between the 2? Any additional color you can give there, I think, would be helpful.

Janesh Moorjani
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Taylor, I'll break that into 2 parts. One is around the underlying business performance that you mentioned and the second is just the mechanical aspects of modeling the growth for fiscal '27. So first, in terms of just the underlying growth that we see in the business, we feel very good about this year. And if you look back at the last couple of years, we've demonstrated consistent growth, and that trend has continued in this year. We've also talked before about the diversification of our business across industries, across geographies and customer sizes. That's a strength for us.

And again, we saw that play out here in Q3 as well. If I look ahead, we're excited by the growth potential of businesses like construction, in Fusion, infrastructure and some of the others that we outlined at Investor Day. So overall, I think we're executing really well, including on the AI strategy and road map, and we feel very well positioned in that regard.

So if I think about the growth for the future, I think all of those things give me confidence, but also when I guide for next year, we will consider, as I mentioned, the go-to-market optimization and the macro risks that I touched on at the start of this call. And then in terms of some of the underlying mechanics, thank you for the question. I think it's actually helpful to spell out what we expect to see next year.

So to break that apart, if I think about the billings and free cash flow growth rates this year have been inflated because of the transition to annual billings for most multiyear contracts. That's a business model transition that we expect to complete during Q1 of next year. And so we expect that reported billings and free cash flow growth will start to normalize during next year.

Billings and revenue growth rates have also been inflated this year from the new transaction model for which we provide the details separately on an underlying basis. And on that transition, we expect a smaller impact from that in '27 than we had in '26. We'll also have incremental headwinds to reported operating margins from the new transaction model next year. But ultimately, as you know these are just near-term accounting effects, and the underlying business has been performing consistently well. Our goal is to try and get to as reported numbers as soon as we can. So that will be our focus in the future.

Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter of Morgan Stanley.

Elizabeth Elliott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I wanted to follow up regarding some of the new AI capabilities like AutoConstrain, which appear to have the high acceptance rates and measurable productivity gains. The question is, are these product improvements translating into observable changes in retention, multiproduct adoption or expansion activity. And just as the platform overall delivers more value with AI, how are you thinking about the pricing power. Any sort of larger, more periodic price increases or a steadier cadence tied to just incremental AI-driven capabilities? Is that an opportunity that you look forward to?

Andrew Anagnost
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So thank you for the question, Elizabeth. So first off, let's be very clear, this is a multiyear journey here that we're on, right? And I want to be clear that there's -- we're going to be kind of moving along with our customers here and focusing on key areas of adoption and finding levers of productivity that make a real impact on them.

We're starting with tasks, AutoConstrain is a classy example of a task within the modeling. We're going to do a lot of that. That task automation is highly protective of our existing business. And what the customers love is they see large incremental productivity increases that are not classically easy to replicate in a traditional kind of development model and feature creation model. So task automation is highly protected with the existing business, is highly retentive and we see some of that with some of the satisfaction ratings we get with some of this technology we move forward.

We're going to be moving more and more into workflow automation, as you see us move next year. We talked about some of this at AU, we showed some pretty compelling workflows between various products and across various products from design to preconstruction planning and things like that. Those workflow automations are going to ultimately offer additional monetization opportunities because some of it will be included with the subscription, but some of it will not, will be charged for incrementally.

And as the customers adopt those and as we find the right workflow levers, you're going to see us start to capture some of that value. Now as we move down the curve into systems-level optimization, those are going to capture the most value. They're further down in the pipeline, but they're also the kind of things that have huge impacts on our customers and huge value delivery, and we're going to capture some of that value.

We're going to share some of it with our customers, but we're going to capture that value. So [indiscernible] automations are highly retentive. They have retentive effects. You can see that with the way the customers are satisfied with the product and what they see in the product. The workflow automations are going to be also highly retentive, but they're also going to offer incremental monetization opportunities and system-level optimizations will offer more monetization opportunities. But this is going to take time.

Elizabeth Elliott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. And then just as a follow-up, I wanted to ask on the margins where it was really impressive to see the underlying margin expansion kind of move up in the full year guide. So the question is, where are you seeing the most outsized success that's driving up the full year view? And what are the levers that are having more of an impact in the near term versus what can be more of a driver next year for the underlying margin trajectory?

Janesh Moorjani
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Elizabeth, maybe I'll take that one. I think the underlying levers are the same near term as well as longer term. The biggest lever in terms of achieving our margin targets over the long term will be our go-to-market optimization. And on that, we've already made great progress so far, and that will ultimately further reduce our sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue.

We also have inherent operating leverage, which is something that we've demonstrated for a few quarters now. And so that shows up in the near-term numbers, and that will also be a driver for us longer term. And embedded in that operating leverage, there are a few puts and takes. To start with, on the gross margin front, we expect that cloud and AI workloads will ultimately be accretive to gross profit dollars, but they will pose a headwind to gross margin as they scale.

We think that's actually a sign of success if that happens in terms of our strategy for adoption working quite nicely. On the R&D side, as we've shared before, we will continue to prioritize investments in innovation and AI-driven initiatives, but at the same time, drive efficiency through common components in the platform. And on the G&A side, we will just scale efficiently as we continue to grow the business.

So those are some of the things that I see. And in terms of the rate of progress of getting to the 41% margin target that we outlined, as I had mentioned earlier, the path to getting there will be nonlinear, just given the additional margin headwinds we expect from the new transaction model this year. But overall, we feel we're well on our way to achieving the target, and we've already raised the current year outlook here by 50 basis points. So we feel pretty good about that.

Our next question comes from the line of Josh Tilton of Wolfe Research.

Joshua Tilton
Wolfe Research, LLC

Thanks for sneaking me in, and congrats on another great quarter. Two for me. One more near term, one maybe long term. Just in the near term, I think if I look back, this is probably one of the biggest increases of the billings growth guide going into Q4 that we've seen maybe ever.

And I'm just trying to understand or maybe you could help me unpack what exactly is driving that near-term performance? And then my follow-up to that is just more longer term, the agency transition seems to be going well. I wouldn't say well underway, but I feel like it's hit maybe critical mass to some extent. Can you maybe talk to some of the levers that you have to incentivize this newly formed channel to drive better new business growth for you guys going forward?

Janesh Moorjani
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Josh, maybe I'll start. In terms of the outperformance that we had here in the third quarter, there's a couple of sources. One is, as I mentioned, just consistent strong execution from the team, which is something that we are all very proud about. But the second is also just in terms of the guidance philosophy that we had and the approach that we took entering the quarter where, as you know, against the low end of our billings guidance, we had assumed a pretty severe macroeconomic scenario, which we had been quite transparent about and that didn't play out.

The broader macroeconomic environment was relatively stable. So I think you saw some of the benefits of that here as well. And if I think about the Q4 view on that and the extent of risk that we've got baked in, there is a little bit of risk baked in at the lower end of the guidance range, particularly on billings. But given that we've got basically just a little over 2 months here left to go in the year, we didn't feel like we needed to take as dimmer view of the macro for Q4, as we had previously taken.

Andrew Anagnost
President, CEO & Director

And to the second part, Jason, I mean, Josh, sorry, I'll weigh in on that a little bit, okay? So there's a couple of things that we're enabling with the new transaction. One, we have better customer intelligence which is going to allow us to be more efficient with our partner engagements. The other one is, is we're working really hard to automate more of the things that are associated with renewals.

So if you look at the way we want to move forward, you're going to see us incenting the channel more on new business than on renewals, which is going to align the channel with kind of our long-term objectives. It's easier to make renewals now, so we should be paying less on renewals, and we should be paying more on new business so that the channel can build the right kind of capacity for the new business and hunt a bit more and renew in a more automated way. So look for us to continue to push that as we head into next year, tighter intelligence going into channel, more efficiency, more automation, more self-service tied to renewals and a stronger emphasis on new business generation.

Our next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink of Baird.

Joseph Vruwink
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I wanted to go back to the FY '27 outlook. And I guess what I really want to ask is, do you need the same level of prudence when you frame the forward outlook like you have been using. And I just sit here and appreciate that this year, you started 8 to 9. It looks like it will end closer to 11. There's something to be said about prudence, but also nothing wrong with communicating strength when it's evident. And I think you're not only seeing strength, but it would seem like next year, definitely end of stages and some transitional elements, early stages on things like consumption or cloud adoption that can contribute more. I'm just wondering if some of that factors into a different approach to the outlook.

Janesh Moorjani
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Joe, so look, on fiscal '27, it will make sense to talk about the specifics when we are actually guiding to fiscal '27 in February. What I wanted to do today is share our overall enthusiasm for how we're executing here in Q3. I talked about some of the momentum that we are seeing and some of the factors that continue to excite me about the business in the long run and just be transparent about some of the factors I'll consider when I set guidance in terms of the specific levels of those, we'll talk about those on the next call.

Joseph Vruwink
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. No, that's fair enough. There are some good sessions from your large customers on how they've set up kind of centralized Autodesk development teams and you have different regional teams that are now building around platform services in a coordinated way. A lot more talk about how agents are factoring into what these teams are now starting to do.

I guess there's this idea still percolating out there that AI is going to make it easier for your large E&C customers, these same entities maybe just do more internally? And I guess I wanted to ask what you're seeing on this topic. And really when we see a large E&C account, talk about data sciences on staff and what they're doing, should we really think, well, Autodesk is ultimately having a role here?

Andrew Anagnost
President, CEO & Director

Yes, you should absolutely think that, Joe, okay? Our goal is to make it easier for them to apply their IP with their data scientists to the workflows that make the most impact on their business, but our platform is going to be everywhere in this.

And the services and agents we build associated with our platform are going to be core to how they create that value from their IP, incrementally above some of the models that we build ourselves and that we deploy into their environments. We want to coordinate and work with agents they may build internally with the agents that we have and one should be augmenting the others. So look for our platform to be everywhere that these customers actually execute and incrementally build capabilities on?

Next question comes from the line of Bhavin Shah of Deutsche Bank.

Bhavin Shah
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Great. Congrats on the strong results. Janesh, I know you spoke about this briefly in your prepared remarks. But in terms of channel productivity, excuse me, how much time is still spent on operational elements? And when do you think the channel gets back to full productivity? And is there any kind of impact also with all the M&A activity happening with your resellers?

Janesh Moorjani
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. We continue to address some of the operational friction that our partners faced on the new transaction model. Andrew referenced that as well. I think we've made very good progress, and I think much of that is behind us at this point in time. There's a bit more to be done, but we are well on our way. We saw the EMEA partners get their first renewals here in September on the new transaction model and that generally went as we expected it would.

And I think at this point, we've tapped -- we've lapped all of the first annual renewals. So in terms of the future, we continue to focus on how we and our partners can deliver more valuable and data-driven and connected products and services to our customers. We have seen the strategy working quite nicely, particularly at the low end where many of the customers that previously used to buy from the noncontracted partners or the silver partners are now buying from us directly on the store.

And some of our larger partners are focused on continuing to build out value-added services that allows them to build more connectivity and offer better solutions to customers, which then works quite nicely for us in the long term as well.

Bhavin Shah
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

That's helpful there. And as a follow-up for Andrew, maybe just for you, there's been some recent headlines about agents turning 2D sketches into 3D models via CAD software. As innovation continues to evolve here, what role can Autodesk play? And how are you thinking about evolving the product capabilities as agentic and copilots that turn sketches into the models continue to evolve?

Andrew Anagnost
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think you should assume that the level of data that Autodesk has in this particular area and the level of focus will certainly excel above anything else you see out there. We just focus where the biggest returns are right now.

Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke of Citi.

Tyler Radke
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

So the direct revenue has grown significantly. I think it was up 85% this quarter. You called out strength in the online store, the Autodesk store. Just wondering, is this strength? Is this coming in well above your expectations? And how should we just think about the mechanics of taking more business direct and potentially that being a tailwind to the reported revenue that we're seeing.

Janesh Moorjani
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Tyler, I'd say in Q3, things worked as we expected they would. We were expecting to see an increase in the mix of direct revenue as the new transaction model continues to scale. So that generally played out the way we expected it would. And in terms of the impact of that on the model, it does affect the as-reported numbers, as you know, which was why we also provide the views on an underlying basis.

I'd say the store strength has continued for some time. A portion of that might be channel shift, but a lot of it is also just general strength we've seen particularly in a number of the countries around the world that we've talked -- where we haven't rolled out the new transaction model, we've been seeing strength in those countries as well. So I think it is a bit broader based on that.

Tyler Radke
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Great. Helpful. And then, Janesh, just on the underlying growth, I know you got some questions on this, specifically as we think about FY '27 guidance. But you started off the year in sort of the high single-digit ballpark. And I think if we look at the Q4 guide, normalized growth is closer to kind of the low teens. Is that a fair characteristic of where the underlying growth of the business is today? Maybe there's some onetime revenue in that Q4 number as it relates to EBAs. Just help us understand like where is that underlying growth of the business in your view now? And I assume that's maybe a few points higher than it was at the beginning of the year.

Janesh Moorjani
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Tyler, at the start of the year when we laid out our guidance, again, we had been prudent for a variety of reasons. It was also my first guidance for the full year as CFO, we had just done a restructuring. There were a number of other factors as well that played into that. But if I -- and at that point, I had mentioned that I viewed the business as being a consistent and resilient business. And I think that's played out quite nicely.

If you look at the growth we've seen over the last couple of years. And then if I look at this year, we've had very consistent growth across the 3 quarters of this year and that same consistency is implied in the guide for Q4 as well. So we feel very good about the way we've executed and all the irons we have in the fire to continue to sustain our momentum in the future. But again, we will consider our overall risks around go-to-market execution as well as the macro when we guide.

Our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong of Oppenheimer & Co.

Hoi-Fung Wong
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Andrew, I wanted to circle back on a comment that you made about the incentive structure to partners. I realize that you guys are taking it down on renewal to incentive some hunting. Any early feedback from partners and I realize it doesn't take effect usually until February, but any early behavioral changes that you guys are noticing from the channel?

Andrew Anagnost
President, CEO & Director

Yes, nothing pronounced, okay? No early changes. Obviously, partners always have lots of questions when we change their incentive structure. But generally speaking, they get what we're trying to do and they understand what's going on here. We're not trying to take money out of the channel ecosystem. We're trying to shift how it gets paid out. It makes total sense to them. We haven't seen any initial kind of changes in their behavior right now at all.

Hoi-Fung Wong
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Okay. Perfect. And then on the VBA side, Janesh, I realize you're not expecting any tailwinds on the free cash side. Are you guys seeing an early impact on the top line in terms of kind of customer spending behavior or any customer project activity?

Janesh Moorjani
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Nothing that I would directly attribute to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act yet.

Our next question comes from the line of Koji Ikeda of Bank of America.

Koji Ikeda
BofA Securities, Research Division

I wanted to follow up on a previous question on free cash flow. And Janesh, I think you mentioned there's about 2 more quarters left before free cash flow normalization. Did I hear that right? And then beyond that, what should quarterly free cash flow seasonality look like? Is there a fiscal year example from the past that we could look at that would be a good representation of what it would look like going forward?

Janesh Moorjani
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Koji, the comment earlier was around the growth rates that we would expect will come down. If I think about the absolute dollars of billings that we have at this point in time associated with the change in the multiyear to annual billing transition. I think that piece is done. But in terms of thinking about cash flow and providing maybe a general rule of thumb, I would say holding aside any significant discrete items we generally would expect free cash flow growth to be correlated with our underlying non-GAAP net income growth. And of course, we will call out any large discrete items when we provide guidance.

Koji Ikeda
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. And then maybe a follow-up here question for Andrew and thinking about the AI strategy and the data access strategy for AI through MCP and API calls. How have customer usage trends been around there? And any update on how we should be thinking about any timing of the monetization opportunity with the data access strategy?

Andrew Anagnost
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So there's actually a fairly robust use of some of our APIs by the customers. And also, [indiscernible] monetizing some of that access as well and a lot of customers are expecting that. Most customers won't be impacted by that, but those customers that are most heavily using machine-based kind of applications associated with our APIs, will probably see impacts in terms of billings associated with their usage, right? Again, the AI monetization will play out over time. The API monetization will play out over time. But MCPs and APIs are definitely another source of monetization that you'll see us pulling the lever for as we move forward.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo Securities.

Michael Turrin
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I'll give you a chance to summarize some of the prior comments. I think high level, the question is you're raising numbers across the board. For fiscal '26, it's not something we're seeing a whole lot of across software these days. So maybe just expand on your perspective around what's driving that and how much of that is beyond the scope of just macro and business model changes. And then on CAD, specifically, it's another quarter of standout growth 15%. So maybe touch on that segment and if there are any specific dynamics to be mindful of there as well.

Janesh Moorjani
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I'm happy to touch on both of those. If I had to summarize Q3, I would say it reflects the consistent momentum we've seen from sustained execution this year against the backdrop of a stable macro, while on the guide at the lower end, we had assumed that the macro would worsen. So I think it's both our execution as well as the more prudent guidance assumptions that didn't play out.

In terms of the growth of the AutoCAD business, there's a few factors there. That growth is partly affected by just the mechanical accounting on the new transaction model as well. So I think that's part of what you're seeing. But also, we talked about strength in the Autodesk store and strength in emerging countries like India and LatAm and the Middle East and some of the AutoCAD strengths that we've seen comes from those countries and from the Autodesk store as well.

Andrew Anagnost
President, CEO & Director

And Michael, I'll just add one more thing to this because I have to. We have been making some serious and important strategic decisions over the last 3 years about how our business is structured and how we move forward. You're seeing the results. All right? These are the results that we ultimately said we were going to deliver as a result of those investments and those changes. They were hard changes, difficult lifts. Now you're seeing the performance associated with those lifts.
