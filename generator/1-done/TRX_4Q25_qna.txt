Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Heiko Ihle with H.C. Wainwright.

Heiko Ihle
H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division

Looking forward to seeing some of you next week. You were talking about the drill rig that's coming this week. Can you give a bit of color on where you expect to focus this drilling? You hinted at it a little bit earlier. How many meters do you expect to see the time frame for drilling and maybe even a bit of background on costs and changes to costs since I assume they're substantially cheaper than hiring someone that owns the rig.

Stephen Mullowney
CEO & Director

Yes. Richard, I'll hand that question over to you.

Richard Boffey
Chief Operating Officer

I only caught a bit of it, but I think I caught quiet enough -- sorry, I was just jumped off there for a second. In terms of our drilling, we've got a reverse circulation drill that we intend to immediately start on the Eastern Porphyry pit for resource definition. We'll be drilling that at a cost of about $25 a meter. Normal contracting rates in Tanzania are about $50. Our diamond drill of -- what do we expect to get out of that?

I think it was one of the questions of the order of 4,000 meters a month or close to 50,000 meters a year. So there's lots to do. We'll also use that RC to assist us with the diamond by doing pre-collars, which will bring the cost of the deeper exploration down as well.

The diamond itself should be starting in the third quarter. And we're expecting -- well, we've got a lot of drilling to do. We've got a 35,000-meter drill program to upgrade the first 500 meters of the underground mine -- design mine to indicated, and then we'll have the results of the exploration program.

So it could well be that we get a second rig to assist in all of that. But we'll be looking to drill about 2,000 to 2,500 meters a month at a cost of about $50 a meter. And again, that's about half the cost of contractor mining -- contractor drilling.

Heiko Ihle
H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division

When you say there might be a second rig, how long does it take to get something like that? Is that easy to do? Is there like importing it, is this tough? I have no idea.

Richard Boffey
Chief Operating Officer

Yes. Logistics is tough in Africa and especially in Tanzania. Look, it's a 4- to 5-month exercise to be perfectly honest. So yes, we've got one drill arriving today or it's morning now, so it should be arriving tomorrow, Tanzania time and the next one is on the water probably in a couple of weeks, and we'll probably be here in about, let's say, about 7 or 8 weeks. So yes, 4 or 5 months process to get another one. That's certainly available. There's no problem with availability.

Heiko Ihle
H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division

Right. And then just playing big picture here for a second. I mean, obviously, 2025 was quite transformational. It seems like this question. You talked a bit about the mine plan on this call. And just in general, do you want to maybe just sum up the three catalysts for the company that you're most excited about for the next 12 months that are maybe underappreciated by people like me and by the market as a whole?

Stephen Mullowney
CEO & Director

Yes. So I'll get that from my perspective. Look, I think we've been decently conservative. And look, over time, we've always been decently conservative. So I think there is upside potential on potentially maybe on some of the financial results. Gold price is certainly heading in the right direction. So I think that is there.

I'm quite also confident on the -- we will get, hopefully, a new agreement with the government that kind of is more easily explained and is more transparent and better for all parties, including the government. That's another one. I don't think there's been a lot of focus on that. Obviously, that can take time or can speed up. It's not all within our control.

The -- and then look, nobody has ever gone around looking for structures around this property. And when you look at the landscape in around this property, -- there's lots of gold all over the place. You see lots of activity on the artisanal side in and around this area, which means there is gold.

And I think the geophysics study as well as getting some drill bits initially into the ground in some of these areas could be a great, great surprise here. And there's a reason why that 1,000 ton per day plant is going to stay there, particularly if there's surface materials, they'll go through a really good recovery rate. So I think there's a potential for that to happen. And obviously, if all of that comes together, then you're going to update your study to get a higher NAV. So it can all be quite good.

Heiko Ihle
H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division

The metal pricing environment helps -- all I would say is the metal pricing environment obviously helps.

Stephen Mullowney
CEO & Director

Yes, it helps. Yes, exactly. But like I said, look, we are always going to be price takers as a gold miner. And you have to have your business plan, focus on your business plan, even considering lower potential prices, and you want to be successful even in that environment.

So I think we're set up very, very well along all gold prices. And I personally believe that they will go higher as well given what's going on in the world and potentially lowering of interest rates, particularly in the United States with the Fed uncertainty coming in 2026. So I think gold prices will go higher over time. That's just my own personal opinion.

Operator

I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Mullowney, who will take us through questions submitted in writing. Please go ahead.

Stephen Mullowney
CEO & Director

So I'm going to just go and turn my head a little bit, so you see more on the side of my head as I go at this on another screen and go through the questions here. We got 5 or 6 questions. So I'll go through them.

And the first question is, what is the company's hedging strategy in the event of declining gold prices next year? Congratulations on success. Thanks for your time.

So right now, we are unhedged on gold prices. And I think we're going to continue to be unhedged going into next year. I think -- there is ways to hedge if we decided to hedge. We get offered them every day. And in the past, when we're doing CapEx programs, we did do collars. But now the issue with collars is it limits the upside, but it does protect you on the downside.

Mike has a pretty good pulse and to talk to gold traders on a daily basis of where gold prices are going. But as I mentioned as well, we should be successful even if gold prices were to decline. Mike, anything to add to that?

Michael Leonard
Chief Financial Officer

No, I think you said it well, Stephen, earlier, where the landscape is set up well, I think, for gold prices to sustain, if not grow from here. So the expectation is to remain unhedged. But at the same time, we've been very, very conservative on our budgeting. So we've got lots of sensitivity on the downside if heaven forbid it was to pull back.

But at the same time, at these very lofty levels, -- the comment I was going to make to Heiko was we expect to generate perhaps more free cash flow than we included in our budget and perhaps can deploy it further into things like drilling beyond what Richard described. So lots and lots of sort of value-accretive activities that we can pour that free cash flow into next year at these prices. But in the meantime, expect to remain unhedged.

Stephen Mullowney
CEO & Director

The next question is, is there any plan on TRX doing a stock buyback?

Good question, and that goes into valuation, and there will be another question here in a second on liquidity in the market that has picked up. So with regards to that, I can't make any promises on buybacks, but it's certainly something that has started to enter into our mindset is what I would say, particularly if gold prices stay here and continue.

Obviously, that would mean taking cash from Tanzania into corporate and making sure that, that's okay. Obviously, we are negotiating with the government at the same time around the JV agreement. So there's all kinds of things to consider when that is being contemplated. But certainly, what I would say is it -- has entered the early stages of being in our mindset.

Michael Leonard
Chief Financial Officer

Well, I think, Stephen, I mean, you touched on it again at the start of the call. We look at capital allocation, of course, on a regular basis as part of our budgeting process. And I think your comment was there's only so much capital to go around. And what we've kind of lined up in terms of order of priority would be the plant expansion and optimization work that Richard touched on in line with the PEA, coupled with drilling.

But as and when you generate additional free cash flow where and how you deploy it, to your point, remains open, and we'll look at the most value-accretive activities in terms of how to do that if and when that free cash is available.

Stephen Mullowney
CEO & Director

So the next one is an interesting question. Wonderful job navigating the last several years making TRX stronger, better suited to enjoy the coming golden era. Can we count on leadership team to remain focused on bigger picture and less on being acquired?

I think the easiest way to answer that question is I don't think there was one instance in this presentation that we said anything about being acquired or people approaching us. So -- and I think as we went through this presentation, you get a sense that we are detail-oriented people and have our eye on increasing the asset value. So that's -- I think we've kind of answered it by doing the presentation. Yes, we are focused on increasing the value of the asset. We think there's a lot of value to go there yet.

Next question. What do you attribute to sustained increase in daily trading volume?

It has been 5x to 10x normal. Is this institutional? So we do keep an eye on 12x or 13x NOBO list and registered stock. We do this a couple of times a year to figure out how shares have traded over, who our shareholders are and things What I can say is we have a pretty good, sticky shareholder group, and we're thankful for that.

And I would say the stock trading from our analysis and particularly I do a lot of work on this, is more around the periphery than it is around the core of the shareholder group. And so I don't think there's a lot of people really influencing that share price. The sustained volumes, I suspect, is attributable to the better financial results of people coming in. We do see a little bit more institutional coming into the stock through filings and what our intel tells us.

I would also say that there's probably some trading going on around. We have 16 million warrants at $0.80 coming due in February -- early February. I would assume there's some trading going around, around that. We are starting to see a trickle in of warrants being assigned and things of that nature. So I would say all of that is leading into what's going on in the market.

It's very interesting what's going on in the market. It's a good question. I don't have 100% of the answer, but I think it all adds up over time to the volume that we're seeing. There's probably some shortcoming. I can tell you, one chart I did look at, you guys can get this free, if you just Google it. The stock price goes down when there's more failed trades.

It goes up when there's less failed trades. Just Google that. And what site did that come up on, Mike? Is it FINRA, I believe it is, dot org, and you'll see that detail there. You'll also see the cost to borrow shares available. All of that sort of stuff comes into play. And it's interesting, the chart was -- I would say the correlation, Mike, was 0.9 between failed trades and decline.

And then when there's less failed trades, it went up. So you can see that in those charts. And so I encourage anybody who's really a market guy to go and review that. That's all publicly available information.

And an individual asked that question, you want to get into a little bit more? More than happy, just give me a call. Send me a quick e-mail and give me a call.

So next question. we are getting more questions. Okay. So I'd answered that. The last one is, are there any near pit potential oxide resources with higher gold price?

Someone moving around the questions on me. So here it is. In-pit cut off with higher gold price, where are the other targets for oxide resources?

Well, that's part of the reason for doing the geophysics. There's certainly going to be some near surface material. One is Richard mentioned, Anfield should have some more near surface -- not the Anfield sorry, East of Porphyry as he redefines that with the drill bit. And there's other pockets around the property as well. And there will be -- once the plant is upgraded, put into the oxide plant or 1,000 tons there. Look, I think, Richard, as we go around, snoop around, there's going to be more and more material there for oxides?

Richard Boffey
Chief Operating Officer

Yes. And we've got a good team out there who have already identified some prospective areas I'd like to put a few drill holes in just a small oxide occurrences and things like that. So yes, certainly, these gold prices as well with getting a little in-ground inventory together.

Stephen Mullowney
CEO & Director

Yes. So I think that's that. And that's the end of the question. So do we have any other -- I see text here to.

Michael Leonard
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, Stephen, I think Rosita had a question there, that's sitting in the queue.

Stephen Mullowney
CEO & Director

Sitting in the queue here. Yes, excellent. This is another M&A question. You've seen a pickup of M&A activity in North America. What's your thoughts on the deal landscape in Africa? We've been approached? How would you assure that the interest of shareholders are protected?

So yes, M&A activity has picked up, particularly in North America and valuations for North American exploration and producers and development plays have run quicker and higher than elsewhere in the world. So I think valuations will start to pick up. It usually trickle on effect from large cap to small cap also from North America to elsewhere.

So I think we're starting to see that come into our stock and into other stocks as well as people look at gold properties. With regards to the African landscape, I do expect that to pick up as well. And certainly, that's what we are seeing and hearing. I can't comment on TRX or Buckreef, obviously.

The -- how do we protect ourselves?

We have a diversified shareholder base. And I'm in decent contact with that shareholder base. I don't think this is the price level that they would entertain. It would be difficult for someone to acquire a position in the company or a toehold given that diversified shareholder base.

As I mentioned earlier, the shareholder base is quite sticky. So -- and there's not a lot of really what I'll say, shares available on the market. And thus, if someone were to try to take a run at it, shareholders are going to benefit because it's going to be run up in price pretty quickly, I would think, given the dynamics of what I see. I hope that answers your question.

Michael Leonard
Chief Financial Officer

Stephen, I think Ron has added a question to the queue as well.

Stephen Mullowney
CEO & Director

Political unrest in Tanzania. Any comment impact on operation for ongoing stability of the country?

So look, there was planned protests yesterday. It went through very peaceful yesterday in Tanzania [indiscernible] there. Yes, there were protests with regards to the election that has all seemed to settle down.

Has it had an impact on our operations?

No. I think we lost 1 day by not having an electrician being able to get the site. And right now, it's operations as normal. The security situation is very calm and things are getting done. So I don't think there's going to be a lot of political unstability in Tanzania. It's been the same political situation for the last couple of decades. I don't expect that to change. Khalaf, anything else to add to that?

Khalaf Rashid
Senior Vice President of Tanzania

No, I think that's correct. It's been very safe and stable. Yesterday was our Independence Day, we expected some protest, but nothing happened -- everywhere in the country. So hopefully, that's something of the past now. Yes.

Stephen Mullowney
CEO & Director

I think that's it. Well, thanks, everyone, for the call and coming on board today. If anybody has any other further questions, the management team is more than happy to answer them. You reach out to us through our IR inbox. Mike and Amy have a constant pulse on that daily.

So look at that and respond, and we're more than happy to set up calls with our shareholder group. So again, thank you for your patience and support. We look forward to 2026, continuing to expand, continue to grow. And hopefully, we have a much better 2026 than even a good 2025. Thank you. And as I was say in Tanzania [Foreign Language]

Operator

This brings to a close today's meeting. You may now disconnect. Thank you for your participation, and have a pleasant day.
