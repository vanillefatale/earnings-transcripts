And our first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.

Dara Mohsenian
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So I just wanted to touch on EMEA revenue growth, strong reported results in the last couple of quarters. We're also seeing really robust retail takeaway in Nielsen and Western Europe in what's countries that are more developed with higher per capita consumption. So just want to get your perspective on what's driving the strong category growth in Western Europe, perhaps compare and contrast that with the U.S. category acceleration we've seen over the last year?

And the second part of that strength in EMEA is Monster's market share has accelerated in the last couple of quarters here. So I know Hilton touched on some of the factors in the prepared remarks, but perhaps just give us a bit more detail on what's also driving the Monster share acceleration in EMEA?

Hilton Schlosberg
CEO & Vice Chairman

Sure, Dara. That's a long question, but I'll do my best to answer it. Category acceleration in Europe, fundamentally driven by strong value proposition that we have with energy products compared to other NARTDs, combined with brand image, image is really important in our industry and category functionality, which all combine to make energy drinks all-day multi-occasion beverages with a wide appeal across age groups.

We've also had this ultra-wide viral social media growth through the Internet and following that a lot of endorsements. And for those of you who haven't followed that on social media, it's something really worth seeing. A large percentage of our category consumers, we've heard about 25%. We did some studies in Western Europe based on usage and attitude. And we basically have heard from these studies that 25% of consumers are actually new to the category in the last 12 months and come from a range of other categories, including water, juice, coffee and sparkling soft drinks. We have not done the study in the U.S., just in Europe to be precise.

The energy category has a wide range of product offerings, both sugar, non-sugar SKUs with an extensive range of flavors and material product innovations and innovations. Similar to the U.S., value proposition, brand image, functionality, consumers new to the category come from a range of other categories, water, coffee, coffee house, coffees are becoming really expensive and energy drinks are seen as a more affordable alternative. We've got zero and we've got full sugar variants and as you know, a wide variety of innovation.

And if we talk about share gains, that was another part of your question. Mark just sent me a note and said I didn't answer your question properly. I have to talk about share gains. So Monster outperformed the category, and you could see the share gains in the attachment to the release, which we're pretty excited about. The achievement in EMEA in market share was pretty phenomenal.

So again, we outperformed the category with growth driven both from innovation and from existing SKUs, which are consumer favorites. And that's really important about our business is that growth is driven by innovation as well as from existing SKUs, whereas if you look at the rest of the category, they are mainly dependent on innovation for growth.

Ultra, the Ultra brand platform has led the growth with Ultra White supported online, as I mentioned, and social media consumer endorsements together with really good Ultra innovation. Growth in the Monster SKUs has Monster Green. Juice Monster has added to the positioning in Europe and Lando Norris Zero Sugar, you add that all together, that combined to drive growth ahead of the category. Lando Norris was, as I mentioned in the script, one of the best launches we've ever had in EMEA. And we've had some good results in the U.S. as well in the limited markets where we have released Lando Norris Zero Sugar.

So sorry, I was a little bit long-winded, but I hope that answered your question. Mark seems to be happy. So...

Our next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS.

Peter Grom
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Hilton, I was hoping to just get your perspective on the top line trajectory from here, but more from a category standpoint. Obviously, this year has been solid, probably better than most of us would have expected if you asked us this time last year. So just -- as we look out to '26 and just given the various cross currents and tougher comps, how do you see category growth evolving as we look ahead? Would you expect some moderation? Or do you think the strong level of growth can continue? And then just quickly more of a housekeeping. The quarter-to-date number, sometimes there can be a shift in ordering patterns around pricing adjustments. So just curious if there was any sort of benefit from that in the October number?

Hilton Schlosberg
CEO & Vice Chairman

Okay. So we did not see a benefit in this quarter from the price increase that -- we will talk about if anyone asked a question that is effective November 1 and including October. So we do not see any impact in the quarter and in October either.

So just looking at the key drivers of growth, and then we can talk about your question for 2026. But again, we don't give guidance. But as I talk through what I believe are the key drivers for the category and for growth, we can get a feel -- or you can get a feel of what could happen in 2026. Number one, we spoke about the value proposition relative to other beverages, relative to coffee house coffees. So that's something that I believe is really important in the growth that we are seeing.

We're seeing increasing household penetration. We're seeing new entrants into the category. Monster has always stood for image. Image is really important and image is really important in the energy drink category. We've spoken about innovation, the need state for energy. There's a huge -- everyone wants energy. They need energy, and we offer that. The fact that we are an affordable luxury, which we've spoken in the past and also this whole sort of move behind the Ultra brand family.

And energy drinks are becoming more acceptable in society. At one time, they were kind of looked at and people were concerned about them. But now understanding the levels of caffeine, which are not exorbitant and less than half of equivalent size of a coffee house coffee, energy drinks are becoming more acceptable.

And then when we look at 2026, we can make our own conclusions, but we are having a price increase that we'll talk about maybe. And innovation, we've got a lot of innovation planned for the remainder of this year that's happening. It's all in market, and we've got great innovation for 2026 as well. And we're excited about all the innovation, including these LTOs for America's 250th year anniversary.

Our next question comes from Matthew Smith from Stifel.

Matthew Smith
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Since you mentioned pricing, I'll swap my question in here. You have pricing effective November 1. It sounds like you're taking a strategic approach versus a broad line increase. In the U.S., what level of pricing do you expect from the increases in promo reductions? And do you expect price realization to be significantly different by channel?

Hilton Schlosberg
CEO & Vice Chairman

Okay. So let me start off by saying we've completed our discussions with our bottlers and our customers. And we will have revised pricing implemented effective November 1, which is already happening. As I also said on the call, we anticipate minimal impact on volumes, reflecting the energy drink category's favorable value proposition and relatively modest pace of price increases compared to other NARTD categories. And now I'm just going to hand this question over to Rob Gehring, who has been our Chief Growth Officer, as most of you will know, who's been intimately involved in implementing the price increasing and the -- it's better you hear it from him rather than from me. So Rob, please go ahead.

Rob Gehring

You bet. Matt, thanks for the question. I appreciate that. As you're aware, we believe RGM is a balance of art and science rooted in consumer insights where we sequentially strive to grow top line faster than units. And as Hilton mentioned, we remain focused on unit growth, and we're constantly evaluating elasticities because we believe that's a critical strategic consumption metric. So as we engage with our bottlers and our retailers, we strive to optimize the ideal balance of rate, trade spend, package mix and channel mix. And what we have implemented effective November 1, you will start to see in the coming weeks in scanner data, but our goal is to consistently achieve and deliver those objectives.

Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs.

Bonnie Herzog
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

All right. Actually, if I could, Rob, maybe just ask a quick follow-up question on pricing about the net price realization you're hoping to achieve with the actions you just talked about. How do we think about it versus, I guess, the 5% rate or price increase you took last year?

Rob Gehring

I think, Bonnie, thanks for the question, and thanks for the follow-up. We're going to go into a lot more detail about our strategy in December. But at this point, the complexity across channels and package mix and across our brand families, it's a little early to state an exact precise number as we watch this materialize. You're starting to see it in stores now. You'll see in scanner data in coming weeks. But again, our goal is always to manage that balance between delivering that top line ahead of unit growth. So you can see how effective it was for us in 2025, and our goal is to consistently deliver that moving forward.

Bonnie Herzog
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then if I could, Hilton, I'd love to ask you a question about your gross margins in the quarter, which were really strong. And I think they came in better than you expected since I believe you suggested to us last quarter that they would decline sequentially. So just would love to hear from your perspective, like, I guess, what came in better than you thought? I mean, was it stronger volume, you got more leverage, et cetera?

Hilton Schlosberg
CEO & Vice Chairman

So what we said in the release, and I think that's quite important to look at that. So we had pricing actions, which were positive. Our supply chain optimization was again positive, and we had product sales mix. And that's -- as we move from more sugar beverages to lower -- to zero sugar alternatives, that benefits our margin. And then in the quarter, we also had higher promotional allowances, increased aluminum can costs, which we've discussed and geographical sales mix. So you put it all together, pricing was good, increase in pricing, supply chain optimization and product sales mix, and they were the major contributors to gross margin.

Now gross margin was the same as last quarter, which was really pleasing to see. And we're really happy with where we are now. We spoke a little bit about tariffs in the script and that we will see an impact in tariffs. Tariffs, we spoke about another -- a modest impact in this quarter. We saw -- we spoke about a modest impact of tariffs in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2026. And then as we -- if things stay very much the same, we'll then be benefiting from what happened in 2025 because that's when the Midwest premium and the LME started moving on. And then, of course, we'll have the benefit of pricing, which Rob has just spoken about and which has been implemented effective November 1.

And our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Jefferies.

Kaumil Gajrawala
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Well done this quarter. A question on the contribution of affordable energy around the world and its sort of impact on margins. The long history has been margins of international have been lower than the U.S. Now with the launch of affordable energy and given the margin profile, is that the sort of gap that -- is that the sort of product that can maybe narrow that gap in margins of international versus the U.S.? Or is it perhaps just not big enough at this stage to help bridge that?

Hilton Schlosberg
CEO & Vice Chairman

Yes. One of the problems internationally, as I've spoken on many occasions is that the pricing internationally is not the same pricing that we're able to achieve in the U.S. and that we look at some of our competitors, and we have to -- as we compete in a market, we have to price ourselves competitively. And we found that if we stray more than a certain percentage from a large competitor, it does impact volumes. So we have to be very careful with pricing internationally. Plus in most countries, our costs are a lot higher because in the U.S., we have significant scale.

So now turning to affordable energy. I think affordable energy, because it's a concentrate will actually benefit overall margins internationally, but not to a significant degree, I would believe, but it will be a positive contribution because it's a concentrate model. And as you know, concentrated models really generate higher margins than finished good models, which we run on with our Monster brands.
