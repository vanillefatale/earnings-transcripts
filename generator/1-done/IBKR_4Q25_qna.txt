Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from BMO.

Brennan Hawken

I was curious about the call on the customer credit balances. It seems as though the decline in the amount paid– the yield didn't come down quite as much as we were looking for. Just some color around some of those dynamics and what might have caused the lower rates not to flow through and whether or not there might just be some more on the come here in the next quarter or two?

Paul Brody

Yeah, sure. So obviously, the net interest income and the major segments there, being segregated cash, and margin loans and the customer credit balances— it all operated a little bit differently. So for seg cash when the rates come down, even though we have a relatively short duration, there is a little bit of tail out there. And we retain somewhat higher rates while we pay lower rates on our credit balances during that period because they are based on the overnight rates. The rest of the balance of changes: so our very strong performance in the margin lending balances overcame— vastly overcame - the drop in the general benchmark rates.

Brennan Hawken

Okay. Got it. So we got basically a repricing lag on some of the asset side, that makes sense. And from a follow-up, I believe the comment period for your bank charter application ended today. Could you maybe update us on that process, what you've heard back from the regulators? And what kind of impact we should expect i.e., if the bank charter is approved and you go forward with the bank?

Milan Galik

So we have been in contact with the OCC for a while. The way this process works is you are in contact with them, you talk to them, you present the business plan. They point out what they do not like or what they would like to receive more information on. Once you get through this stage, they give you the go ahead to officially file the application, which we did, and they acknowledged that. Then there is a several-months-long time period that they have to actually approve your request. There are others applying for the National Trust Charter Bank; I do not know exactly where we are in the queue. But my expectation would be to be operational by the end of this year. Now exactly what that means for us is, as a broker dealer, the regulations do not permit us to custody assets of mutual funds and exchange traded funds. A trust charter bank will allow us to do that. So that is the rationale behind our application.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Moley from Piper Sandler.

Patrick Moley

I had one on prediction markets. There's been a lot of speculation recently about whether regulators or the US courts will allow prediction market platforms to continue offering sports contracts. So I was just hoping to get an update from you on how you maybe see this all playing out between the platforms and the sports books? And then with ForecastEx launching NFL contracts in the fourth quarter, just wondering what you would need to see from regulators or the courts that would make you comfortable offering contracts like that to IBKR customers? Or if this is an aspect of predictions markets that you just think will never make sense to commingle with your existing customer base?

Thomas Peterffy

So I don't know if you've heard that Massachusetts just came out with a ruling against Kalshi. So the judge ruled against Kashi and that probably means that Kalshi will no longer take customers from Massachusetts. But this is certainly not the final word. So your guess is as good as ours as to what will happen here. And so luckily, Interactive Brokers does not rely on sports. We do believe that these contracts will have enormous applicability to many, many things about the future and they will be very, very successful and it doesn't really have to depend on sports.

Patrick Moley

Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up. You're sitting on a healthy pile of excess cash. Any updated thoughts on the appetite for M&A and capital return priorities. And then on M&A specifically, I know in the past, you said that with traditional brokerage models, it's been difficult to make the deal math work with your pricing model. But in an emerging asset class like prediction markets, I'm just wondering if M&A could make sense here for you.

Thomas Peterffy

Anything is possible, but we're not going to buy a firm that is doing sports betting, and there is nothing else out there at the moment, right?

Milan Galik

It's not only that. We have our own platform— ForecastEx. It's growing nicely. Mid-December of last year, we have rolled out ForecastEx on a 24/7 trading schedule. We added liquidity providers. ForecastEx now lists over 10,000 different instruments, and the trading volumes have increased significantly. So, no reason for us to look for an acquisition in this space.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Yaro from Goldman Sachs.

James Yaro

So you touched a little bit on the OCC National Trust Bank charter. I was hoping you might be able to touch a little bit on the aspirations for a European banking license? And if so, where are you are in the process of looking to get one of those?

Milan Galik

We have not started the process. Having a bank license in Europe would come with some benefits. It is not urgent for us to have one. We will eventually have a license in Europe, the most likely place for us to acquire it would be in Ireland, where our broker operations are already regulated by a banking regulator with whom we have a very good relationship.

James Yaro

Okay. Excellent. I just wanted to ask a follow-up on prediction markets. I was hoping, Thomas, you might be able to just update us on the institutional adoption of prediction markets so far. How you plan to cater to this client set specifically on the retail side? And over what period in your view, institutional prediction markets fully develop?

Thomas Peterffy

So our most frequently traded contracts are temperature contracts. We are currently working on tying up these temperature contracts with the electricity contracts and the natural gas contracts.

And as you know, it is basically the utilities that have to every day make a judgment about the next day’s use of electricity. So we are working on approaching those. And I think that sometime in the course of the year, you will see them onboarding.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America.

Craig Siegenthaler

My first one is on your expanding crypto offering. How should we think about the appetite for adoption across your base? And I'm especially interested in individual investors, in the direct and the i-broker channel. Do they want crypto trading and do they want it from IBKR?

Milan Galik

Crypto revenues are, at the moment, small relative to the overall company's revenues. Most clients who actively trade cryptocurrencies were already doing so before we entered the space. So we are not yet a major brand in the cryptocurrency space.

You asked about the i-brokers. The answer is no, they have not been asking for access to crypto. I'm not sure why that is. Our pricing, as we explained over a number of earnings calls, is superior to our competitors in the United States and outside. We added crypto to our offering to round it out— to particularly target investment advisers and multi-asset clients, who wanted limited exposure to the asset. Our offering is competitive, and we continue to add capabilities, new geographies, namely Europe is currently the focus. I would expect us to go live with our offering this quarter. And then I am hopeful that asset transfers— once we support asset transfers - some crypto assets will migrate to our platform and take advantage of our superior pricing.

Craig Siegenthaler

Thanks, Milan. And just for my follow-up, it's one I've asked, I think, two quarters in a row now, but account growth, still very strong, north of 30%. Thomas, any specifics on how long you can keep this up?

Thomas Peterffy

As long as I shall live! That's my answer. I don't see any reason why our account growth would slow down. It will continue at this rate that we've been going.

Milan Galik

You see the benefit that we have is our platform is attractive to…

Thomas Peterffy

… many people around the world.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies.

Dan Fannon

So just another question on growth, but more just in terms of investment and spend. As you think about all of the initiatives you have entering this year, do you think the level of spend is growing? Is it consistent with the last couple of years? Or how should we think about overall expense growth?

Milan Galik

The overall expense growth, I think, has been consistent over the past many quarters over the last few years. We have been cautiously adding to our head count as we needed in this past year, it was around 6% growth. Our compensation went up by 10% or so. I would expect for us to see similar growth in the future. Of course, we have a number of AI initiatives in process, and those initiatives may affect the rate at which our expenses will grow in the future.

Dan Fannon

Understood. And then just another one on account growth. In terms of the account growth today and where it's been coming from here in the latter part of ‘25 versus maybe where you think there's growth going to change or other areas that could grow faster in next year? Just trying to get a sense of what's different in terms of where you're seeing more success? Or are markets more mature versus less?

Milan Galik

We have been universally doing well. We have been attracting large accounts, small accounts, very active accounts, less active accounts, retail, professional, institutional. They all come to us for the same reason. The technology works, pricing is fair, access is global. No need to rely on promotions or incentives.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Budish from Barclays.

Ben Budish

Maybe tying a couple of these previous questions together, I think Thomas, in the press, you made some comments about the US midterm elections later this year potentially juicing account growth. Can you maybe talk about the— and I think you've mentioned in the prepared remarks, the advertising spend is up a little bit, even though I think a lot of your growth comes from word of mouth— can you maybe talk about your plans to get, or drive, more engagement on prediction markets, either through the Interactive Brokers platform, onboarding more FCMs? How are you thinking about that opportunity coming up later this year to kind of boost account growth even more?

Thomas Peterffy

Advertising is certainly a key. We are getting better and better at advertising, and we are also increasing our spending, advertising spending, to some extent. So that's what it is. We will not let our account growth go lower.

Ben Budish

Love the confidence. Maybe just one more question on prediction markets, you talked earlier about institutional interest. I'm just curious, when we look at some of the institutional products offered at CME and ICE, we tend to see very, very large notional amounts and larger fees per contract but less relative to the size, to the notional amount of exposure. Just curious, onboarding insurance companies, electric utilities, these sorts of institutions— does that require any change to product design? Or do you think it's more a matter of education, making sure the liquidity is there and then you'll be able to onboard those kinds of customers?

Thomas Peterffy

It's not a product design question. It is a matter of selling it.

Operator
