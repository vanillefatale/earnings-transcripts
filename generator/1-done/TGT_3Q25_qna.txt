Question-and-Answer Session


Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.


Simeon Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Brian, best of luck. My question, Michael, for you. I think in 2016 or '17, there was a reset of margin during a prior investment phase that helped reposition Target for the next several years. At this stage, I guess, can we rule that out? How have you thought about taking maybe a deeper investment in, I guess, margin in order to reinvest? Or should we now assume that this is the plan it goes forward and there doesn't need to be one?


Michael Fiddelke
Executive VP & COO

Yes. Thanks for the question, Simeon. We've got a pretty big Q4 holiday season that we'll get through before we unpack the specifics for next year. But what I can tell you is we're committed to making the right investments to get the outcomes we want when it comes to leading with merchandising authority and elevating the experience. We also have a lot from which to draw on there. The team is doing a wonderful job of finding efficiency within the business and changing some of how we work to reinvest.

I mean an example of that is some of what we found in elevating the store experience. We've taken a lot from our fulfillment market test in Chicago. And as a reminder, that's about changing kind of how we organize stores against the work to be done. We've found that making some stores brown box shipping specialists because they've got the capacity, they've got the big backroom. They might be a little lower volume in general. let them ship that brown box product so that we can free up our busiest in stores -- our busiest in-store guest experiences to focus on serving that in-store guest.

And so changes like that, we've seen good results in. We're rolling out some of the learnings from that test to 35 more markets here before the year is out. And that's the type of change we believe can fuel the step-up in experience that we want. And so we're excited about doing the work to get better outcomes when it comes to leading with merchandising authority and elevating the guest experience, and we feel like we're on the right path.

The other thing I might add is you heard us describe our capital investments for next year. And that's putting capital to work in direct support to the priorities that we've laid out. And like we always have, we invest capital where we see strong return. And so we're excited to make the investments in technology, supply chain, but especially store experience next year. More remodels, a strong new store pipeline, more change to the broader store. And so I think that's an example of us seeing the opportunity to invest to get growth and leaning into it.


Simeon Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

A quick follow-up, and you partially addressed it. I wanted to ask about the gaps and capabilities. You mentioned the different focuses, merchandising experience. What are the most urgent gaps and capabilities? And then what are you most excited about, meaning things that can get addressed in the near term?


Michael Fiddelke
Executive VP & COO

And the things that I'm most excited about are some of the places where we're seeing momentum already. Take, for example, the work that we're doing in Fun 101. That's a perfect representation of us bringing real focused strategy to the categories that we used to call Hardlines to say, what categories are what we do -- are the things that we do uniquely well best positioned? How do we bring style and culture and design leadership to those categories. And so we've made more change in those categories, and we see response in those categories. It's good to see categories like toys running an almost 10% increase in Q3. It's good to see the places where we've applied focus moving in the right direction.

I think the same is true on experience. The work we're doing to create a consistently elevated experience, we like the trajectory there. That starts with the basics, being in stock is part of a great guest experience, and we're seeing real meaningful progress from the team's incredible work to move the needle in the right direction there. And while on that front, we're not yet satisfied. We're not yet where we want to be. We like the direction of travel a lot. And so we'll continue to do the work and apply the focus to get improvement in the direction that we want there.

Rick, I don't know if you want to add anything on the product side for some of the places where we've got change and where we're seeing a strong guest response.


Richard Gomez
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. I mean I can -- well, how about this? I'll talk a little bit about some of the capabilities that were -- the question addressed about which capabilities do we want to -- are a priority for us to evolve. And I want to highlight merchant roundtable evolution because it is so important to having those right products that are going to deliver the growth. And it is a cross-functional team that we've had in place. But if you think about the decisions that we made a couple of weeks ago to reduce the footprint in HQ, a big part of that was around simplifying the organization so we could make decisions faster.

The next step in that is to outline how we're going to work differently, clarify roles and responsibilities, clarify decision-making. That's the work the team is doing now. And then what I'm really excited about is in adding in the automation and the technology so the team can spend less time doing the analysis and spend more time being creative coming up with those new ideas that are going to meet consumer needs and fuel growth like what we're doing in Fun 101.


Michael Fiddelke
Executive VP & COO

To build on Rick's last point there, I think the role that technology -- the technology will play is going to be incredibly important across the enterprise, but a huge shout out specifically to the pace at which Prat and team are moving. I like the acceleration of the path forward in technology. I think you can see that in some of the AI examples that we shared today, but you can also see that in some of the core foundation basics that we know we have work to do to make sure our teams have all the tools at their fingertips to build the right assortment, segment that assortment, to use technology more powerfully to automate how product moves through our supply chain. And so that continues to be a key area of focus for us, but the urgency with which we're moving that work along gives me a lot of confidence.


Operator

Our next question comes from Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies.


Corey Tarlowe
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

And I wanted to ask on the level of investment that you're stepping up in the business in terms of the $5 billion for next year in CapEx. How do you think about the key levels or the key areas in which you will be investing? And then how do you think about whether or not that's the right level or if more may be needed to improve results to a greater magnitude across the business?


Michael Fiddelke
Executive VP & COO

Yes. Great question, Corey. And I think about it in 2 ways, and this is a conversation that Jim and I have regularly with input across the team, obviously. But it's 2 things. One is it starts with a focused strategy. Investments need to follow the path that we think drives the most growth for Target, and that starts with clarity on the strategy. And the second is we chase returns. And so the places where we're excited to step up investment are places where we expect really strong returns. That starts with investments in our stores, and those come in a couple of forms.

You've heard us talk about the strength of our new store pipeline. That pipeline continues to be as strong as ever. It's been just a delight to watch the new store openings this year, especially those bigger boxes that continue to outperform our expectations. And there's nothing more fun than walking a brand-newly opened store in a market that maybe didn't have a target or didn't have a target close to that neighborhood and to see the response in the community when we open a store. And that response is great on the faces and voices of those guests, and it's also great in terms of the incremental sales it provides and the high returns we see in those new stores.

The second place where you'll see us continue to lean in is in-store remodels and refreshing the existing fleet of stores. And while we've been talking about that for several years, we've been hard at work, as Brian even touched on in his opening remarks, of remodeling the chain. That work isn't yet finished. And we want to make sure that we're investing in some of the stores that when we bring our latest and greatest store experience, we see a reliable, strong response from guests. We continue to see strong sales lifts that justify the investment in those remodels.

And so for the stores that haven't yet seen a remodel, we think it's imperative that we bring our latest and greatest thinking. That's a direct investment in the store experience itself back to the strategy. and the merchandising authority because when we do a remodel, we reallocate the space up to our latest and greatest thinking by strategy, and that helps the merchandising drive some of that sales lift.

And then importantly, technology will continue to be an area of focus for investment. We know the power of technology to help the humans. And the humans that we focus on most there are obviously our guests and our team. And so wherever we can lean in and use technology, and again, it generates returns when we make things more delightful for our guests and the way technology can help with personalization on the app or help us get product to their doorstep faster.

And then for our team, where we can allow the process-focused work of the team to get a boost from technology that frees up our store team to better serve guests. And so there's a lot of examples within that CapEx investment. But at its core, does it directly support the areas of focus within the strategy. And do we like the returns. And when the answer to those 2 questions is yes, you're going to see us invest.


James Lee
Executive VP & CFO

Corey, if I can add just one more thing on top of that. When we add new stores, the added benefit for us is that we continue to build out our fulfillment footprint and capability and allows us to also expand our national digital reach as well. So there's an added benefit of new stores.


Corey Tarlowe
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. And then if I could just have a quick follow-up to Michael. On your comments on change, I just wanted to double-click on that word specifically and the quotient and the multitude of change that you're thinking about making as we head into 2026 and the benefits that you're seeing from lowering prices on key frequency categories and how you're thinking about the opportunity to cut further costs potentially because we did talk about investing in agility in terms of SG&A. So curious about how you think about the ability for the business to change today and how you're building for the future in that regard.


Michael Fiddelke
Executive VP & COO

Corey, if I zoom out, change is going to be incredibly important. I mean you've heard us say quite plainly, we're not satisfied with our performance over the last few years. While the third quarter came in as expected, you're not going to get a tone of satisfaction for us until that's accompanied by the growth that comes with a positive comp. And so we've got to do the work. There's no shortcuts. And that means driving change to get different outcomes.

We're starting all of that change with really clear priorities. We know how Target is best positioned to uniquely win. And when we lead with great product, when we're design-led and differentiated and we pair that with an excellent experience, that's what's driven Target's strength in the best of times before, and we think the modern version of that can get the growth outcomes that we want. And so that does mean doing the work. That means doing the work to make changes like we are in Fun 101 to get different outcomes on the merchandising side. That means making the right investments and driving the change so that, that experience can be great in every store, every day in stores and online.

But we're doing the work. And huge credit to the team that you can see the progress of that work in ways that get us excited about what's to come even within those third quarter results because we can see where we've focused and made change, we're getting some of the outcomes that we want. And so next year will be about expanding upon that to bring more of those wins across the business at greater scale.


Operator

Our next question comes from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.


Joseph Feldman
Telsey Advisory Group LLC

I wanted to drill in a little bit more there on some of the changes. When you're talking about the in-store changes for next year, are there any examples you can give us? I know you mentioned there are key pads within the store maybe. I'm assuming like the Fun 101, but broadening it out. Maybe you could share a few examples.


Richard Gomez
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

I'd be happy to share a few examples. Let me start with Fun 101 because we talk about it as a success story, and we are delivering growth, but it's just beginning. We still have more changes to make to Fun 101 to truly make that a family destination that's full of style, trend, design, pop culture. So you're going to see those changes come to life in '26. The other area that we're making some changes is in Home. Home has been a challenged business for us. We are making changes to the product to elevate the style of the product, but then we're also changing the store experience to facilitate more discovery, to facilitate more inspiration and really stands tall for what will be a revamped, a reinvented threshold brand.

So those are some of the -- we're making changes. Obviously, our contract with Ulta Beauty ends August '26. So teams are working really hard and coming up with some great ideas for how we will expand our assortment and then how we'll also elevate the experience. We'll be able to share more specifics on that at the financial community meeting. And we're making some changes in Baby. We think Baby strategically is a really important category for us. We have historically done very well there. It's an acquisition kind of category. We bring people into Target, and it starts kind of along several years of loyalty as their children grow up. But we have an opportunity to make that space a little bit more inviting, a little more inspiration and also bring more gifting into it.

So those are just some headlines of what we're looking at. We'll be in a much better position at financial community meeting to share more specifics on those plans. But I got to tell you, I am really excited about these changes. And I think as we said in the prepared remarks, this is the most change we have made to the store floor pad in 10 years. So we're -- it's a lot of work, but we're really excited about it.


Joseph Feldman
Telsey Advisory Group LLC

That's great. That was helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. With regard to the -- your Target Circle Card, can you talk maybe about some opportunities there? It feels like it's been declining, the penetration of Target Circle Card, I guess, has been declining a little bit. And I'm just curious as to if you have any reasons as to why that may be and what you can do to kind of recapture some of those customers, maybe where they've gone otherwise.


Richard Gomez
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Sure. I'd be happy to talk about Target Circle. What we love about Target Circle is it's huge size. It's one of the biggest loyalty programs in the country. And now with Target Circle 360, we have a membership component to it. And what's really exciting about that is it's really helping to fuel our same-day delivery. Target Circle fueled a 35% comp growth in same-day delivery this past quarter, which is really encouraging.

The conversations that we're having is now what, how do we continue to innovate and evolve on the platform? And things that we are looking at and trying our early access events with Target Circle 360. We did that this past October with Target Circle Week, and it was really well received. So we'll be doing a lot more of that this holiday season.

And the last point I would make is we're really excited to have the first-party data that we get through Target Circle and be able to leverage that for personalization, particularly through this holiday season. So that will be one of the tools in the toolbox that we'll be using.


James Lee
Executive VP & CFO

And Joe, if I can just build on the question also specifically on card. If you're referring to what you see in the results from profit sharing, we did see lower spend, a little bit lower penetration and overall lower balances in the card program. But what's important is what Rick just highlighted is we think about our whole loyalty program holistically across Circle, Circle 360 and the card program, and we're very pleased with the results we're seeing so far.


Michael Fiddelke
Executive VP & COO

Where we do have an opportunity, Joe, is to use where Rick started with that big base of Target Circle as a better on-ramp to folks for whom a Circle card makes a lot of sense. And so that's a place where we haven't yet achieved our potential. And so making sure that we -- because we can know a guest in circle so well, that means we should be positioned to know which of them at the right point in time would most like a circle card to. And we've got work to do on that front. We haven't tapped into that to the degree that we would have hoped. And so you'll see that be an area of focus going forward for us.


Operator

Our next question comes from Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. Mike, you might be muted.


Michael Baker
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Can you hear me now? Okay. So I think you said, correct me if I'm wrong, but October flat, yet you're guiding to down low single digits to the fourth quarter. Is that indicative of a little bit of a slowdown post Halloween? And I guess as a follow-up to that, a pretty wide range in terms of EPS for the fourth quarter. Can you talk about what you're expecting in terms of margins within that fourth quarter range and how you get to the low end versus the high end, et cetera?


Michael Fiddelke
Executive VP & COO

Yes. I'm happy to start, Mike, and Jim, feel free to add on. If you look at -- while the quarter came in where we expected it overall, we definitely did see volatility by month. You heard Jim describe that on a net sales basis, the quarter started with a relatively flat August. We saw a decline in September and then October was about flat. And so as we step back and think about the fourth quarter, we do it knowing that we saw more volatility by month in Q3 than we would have expected.

And so that factors into how we're thinking about our expectations, but we feel good that we've got the business positioned well heading into fourth quarter. We feel like our top line and bottom line guidance is prudent based on the volatility that we saw in Q3. And we start the quarter in a really good place, something we haven't unpacked as much yet, so I'll touch on it briefly, is that inventory is in a great place as we step into the fourth quarter.

On the balance sheet, it's down 2%. It's up in our frequency categories, which makes sense given the investments that we're making there and stronger inventory reliability and in-stocks and it's appropriately down, I think, in an appropriately cautious position in the discretionary categories. And so we start the quarter where we would want to be positioned from an inventory perspective, and we feel like it's the prudent place to be.

Jim, feel free to add as we're thinking about profit for the fourth quarter or how we've reflected Q3 trends into that view.


James Lee
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Mike. And if I build upon that, I mean, if you take a step back and look at Q3, obviously, we faced a pretty dynamic environment. And as our gross margins percentage-wise was broadly flat, we're pleased with the performance, and that's in line with expectations. And a big thank you to the team to manage and navigate and move quickly with agility to meet the needs of consumers and understand where things are heading. We expect that dynamic to continue in Q4. We do expect a continued volatile environment, which is why there's a little bit still, I guess, a wider range in place because we want to make sure we are -- we have the ability to react quickly to changes in the environment. that will represent the range that we're looking at.


Michael Fiddelke
Executive VP & COO

The only build I might have, and Rick, feel free to chime in here is we don't have a perfect crystal ball for exactly how it's going to play out by day or by week in Q4. But the thing we feel really good about is how we'll show up for the guests. We've touched a little bit in some of the questions on making sure that we meet the guests where they're at. And for us, that's always a couple of things because there's a couple of ingredients of how guests view value. It's the combination of great prices, and you've heard us invest in 3,000 price cuts across Food & Beverage and Essentials. We're really excited about a Thanksgiving meal for $4 under $20 as we step into Thanksgiving here right around the corner. And for Target, it's also pairing that great price with incredible product.

And so I'm just as excited about the 20,000 new items that we'll have this coming fourth quarter, twice as many as last year as I am about the right pricing guests will find on those items. And so it's that combination for us that matters so much. And on that front, we feel really good about what guests are going to find as they travel the site and the store in the holiday season.


Operator

Does that conclude your question. Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.


Katharine McShane
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

We wanted to drill down a little bit more on your commentary around inventory and in-stocks. Is there any way you can kind of talk to how you feel about the inventory position going into holiday, how it looks versus last year? And just how you see the cadence of in-stocks improving over time?


Michael Fiddelke
Executive VP & COO

Yes, Kate, as I think about inventory broadly, we touched on a little bit of that in Mike's question a second ago, but I do think it's important to spend a moment on in-stocks. And I would expect because being in-stock matters so much to our guests, that's a topic you see us come back to over and over and over again in all of these earnings calls to come because it matters so much. If you've trusted us with a trip to the store, we can't let you down by being out of stock. And we haven't been good enough over the last several years on that front. And so we're laser-focused on improving that.

And a huge credit to the team for the progress that we've seen so far. I can dimensionalize that just a little bit more here in a second. But I also want to emphasize that work is not done. The bar for the consumer, for our guests is higher than ever before on that front. And so you're going to see us continue to lean in to make progress over time. Where we've started is with a really acute focus on those most frequently purchased items, where if we're out of stock, it hurts more if you're a guest and we've let you down. And so -- you heard in my remarks, the focus on our top items. So think of those as the 5,000 most frequently purchased items. They account for about 30% of our unit sales.

And so a big piece of what guests are finding and buying every day at Target. And as the team has leaned in to make progress on that subset of items, it comes in a whole bunch of ways. It comes with embracing the use of technology to help us forecast better and being more in stock that way. It comes with us having a better view of how we're really performing. We've described before, we've changed some of the measures we use for in-stocks to give us a clearer mirror than ever before of where we're doing great and where we're falling down. And that's been really helpful because it's told us, okay, we might be okay on average in some places, but we're not good enough at the end of the day or we have a shortfall on weekends that we need to address.

And so teams have been hard at work in moving the needle there. And on the measures that we move, you heard me describe 150 basis point improvement in Q3. If you're not close to the work, it's maybe tough to appreciate how big that progress is. But what I like is that's better year-over-year improvement in Q3 performance versus last year than we saw in Q2, which was better than we saw in Q1. And that trajectory gets me really excited that we're doing the right work to get a different outcome. And if we can keep that progress up, and I have a ton of confidence that, that's exactly what we'll do, we'll be more and more in stock as we move through 2026 than we were in 2025.

Operator, I think we have time for one more question.


Operator

Our last question will come from Michael Lasser with UBS.


Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

You just outlined a lot of the progress that you're making on key operational metrics such as in-stocks and speed to market, yet we really haven't seen it translate to an overall improvement in the performance of the business. So the obvious question is, why not? And what as outsiders is a reasonable time frame for holding the team accountable for showing that progress?


Michael Fiddelke
Executive VP & COO

Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael. Here's what I'd say. We're not satisfied with the top line performance of the business, even as it's come in as we expected in Q3. And so we're doing the work with urgency. As a team, our focus is to get back to growth. And we know that won't happen overnight, but we know what the path is. We're focused on making progress. We see momentum where we're making that investment, a huge credit to the team to do the work that's going to get that outcome over time.

And so we'll unpack more what our expectations for next year look like when we get to the financial community meeting in March. But I feel really good that we've got a team focused on doing the work now that will lead to growth over time. And rest assured, we are tackling that work with urgency.


Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. My follow-up question is -- if I could just...


Michael Fiddelke
Executive VP & COO

One more Mike, go ahead.


Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And I will add my best wishes to Brian. You've already outlined the $1 billion of incremental CapEx for next year. Perhaps there might be some incremental operating investments that could take down the profitability a bit next year. How amongst those guardrails are you thinking about the commitment to the dividend and the importance of that to your certain shareholders moving forward?


Michael Fiddelke
Executive VP & COO

Well, and Jim, feel free to pile on to this one if you'd like. You've heard us describe our support and strong support over time of the dividend, Michael. You shouldn't expect anything to change there. We've been consistent in our capital priorities for as far back as I can remember in my 23 years here. And it starts with making the right investments in the business. The $5 billion we'll put to work next year, we're really excited. We'll generate the returns and the growth that warrant that level of investment.

The dividend is always the second priority, and I think our track record speaks for itself in terms of our support of the dividend. And share repurchase is the -- with what's left piece that we'll always adjust as appropriate, but the dividend sits second in that priority list for a reason.

Thanks, Michael. That brings us to the end of today's call. Thanks, everyone, for your questions and engagement.
