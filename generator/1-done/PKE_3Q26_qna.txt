Operator

[Operator Instructions] And it looks like we have no questions at this time. Therefore, I will turn it before back over to Mr. Brian Shore for closing remarks.

Brian Shore
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, operator. Thank you, everybody, for listening. We apologize for the presentation going on so long as we had a lot to cover. Please feel free to give us a call if you have any follow-up questions, some of the items, I think we kind of skimmed over a little bit quickly. So feel free to give us a call. We're happy to help you out with any follow-up questions. Have a good day and once again, happy new year all the best to you and your family in 2026. Goodbye.

Operator

Thank you. And this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.
