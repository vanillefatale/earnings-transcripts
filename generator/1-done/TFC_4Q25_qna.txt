[Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.

Ryan Nash
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Bill, can you maybe talk a little bit more about loan growth where you ended the year at up 8% year-over-year and you're guiding to 3% to 4%? And it seems like if you think about the exit run rate, you're already running at about 3% average growth, so it implies, as you said, low single-digit growth. So maybe just unpack the loan growth a little bit further between commercial and consumer and how are you thinking about growth across each of those areas?

William Rogers
Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Ryan. Great to hear from you. Yes, as you noted, we're entering with some good momentum and if you think about the mix, let me sort of talk about how I think this year will pan out. C&I is -- had its sort of strongest quarter. I mean, production was up really, really significantly and just high-quality business, I mean high-quality advice-driven business tied with treasury management, 62% plus had some type of treasury management products are really, really good momentum on the C&I side. I think overall we're going to really sort of focus on places where we have great client demand, clients still healthy, but we're going to rebalance a bit, focus on higher client value and optimizing our return and our mix.

And so I think the result of that is going to be a little more wholesale. The consumer businesses like Sheffield and LightStream and Service Finance continue to see great opportunities there probably in areas like indirect auto and some of those, probably a little less in terms of exposure, margins being a little bit tighter, a little bit lower client value. So I think -- think about it in 2 ways. One, continuing the momentum and things that have high client value, long-term return characteristics and optimizing that return and mix over time. All of that though contributing to 3% to 4% what I would consider sort of like really, really high-quality, consistent growth. And again, building on momentum that we already have.

Ryan Nash
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And if I can ask a follow-up, Mike, on the net interest margin, I think you noted it would exceed last year's 3.03%. Given that you're currently at 3.07%, can you maybe unpack what is included within the margin for deposit pricing? And do you expect the NIM to expand from current levels? And what is the cadence behind that?

Michael Maguire
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes, sure, Ryan. Yes, so it was nice to see the uptick, obviously, in the fourth quarter, which was largely driven by some of the seasonal deposit mix and some of the benefit of the cuts that will go the other way on seasonality in the first quarter. So while we sort of enter the year at 3.07%, we would expect to back up just a touch. But throughout the course of the rest of the year, we would expect to see margin expansion, especially in the second half where we see the benefit of the cuts. You asked around deposit pricing. Our expectation coming into the year is, we'll grind a touch higher on the betas in the first quarter, but we would expect to be in the kind of low 50s neighborhood by year-end.

So you've got the lower cost of deposits. You've also got the fixed asset -- the fixed rate asset repricing engine happening in the background as well. And I think those are factors that are going to really help us make really, I think significant progress on the margin relative. I know previously we've talked about sort of a 3 teens level in '27. We're going to make significant progress towards that level in '26 and frankly see ourselves exiting '26 in kind of that 3 teens area, which is I think a really nice setup for 2027.

The next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore.

John Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

On your 2027 ROTCE target of 15%, I appreciate your -- you reiterated your confidence in the attainability there. And could you possibly help kind of unpack the components that give you that confidence? You mentioned the 3 teens NIM and you might be able to hit that by the end of '26. Just curious on maybe your efficiency expectations underneath that balance sheet growth, how we could think about the pace there as you approach that in 2027? And then also, I think common equity Tier 1, you've alluded to the 10%, but how do you think about capital underneath that 15% ROTCE?

William Rogers
Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes. Sure, John. So think about it maybe in its simplest term is the concept of holding the denominator of capital and dollars steady and then improving momentum and return from the numerator. So sort of think about that as sort of the basic mantra that we're operating from. I'll also say that this is going to be -- we see this as more of a straight line. So in addition to 15%, we're locked in on 14% for this year. So we don't -- this isn't going to be an all at the end parabolic curve, this is going to be a straight line continued improvement. So again, think about that denominator and dollars holding steady. And then the part on the numerator that really is accretive and not necessarily in order, but I'll go down a few of these. Payments is really significant. So think about the growth in payments. We're seeing a 13% kind of growth. We expect that growth to continue in the double-digit kind of basis.

So that's really accretive to not only deposits but also to NIM and sort of the overall ROA. Our middle market expansion, we -- 2x the number of clients we're seeing in that business. So we see that as really, really positive to that growth. Premier and our wealth production, net asset flows in wealth really positive. Premier, I talked about the deposit production and loan production sort of those 20-plus percent kind of activity. And then think about all the things that are deepening client relationships in all of those categories. Those are things that are really most accretive because if you think about -- we've already committed talent. We've already committed capital to those businesses and what we're doing is increasing the return against that.

Mike mentioned fixed asset repricing is a component of it. There's all sorts of RWA maximization efforts to ensure that we're running our RWA engine really, really effectively. We talked about the improving operating leverage. So that's also a component of that as we'll run this revenue increase off a more efficient platform. And then your point on CET1, we're building this model on a 10% CET1. I think that's probably sort of the right ZIP code. And then looking this year to $4 billion in buybacks to accelerate all that. So again, my high degree of confidence is everything I mentioned in there has got momentum against it, initiatives against it. We're starting nothing flat-footed, everything on our toes, which is why I sort of say locked in for 15%.

John Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. All that's helpful, Bill. And then staying along the same lines, I mean, no good deed goes unpunished. So you set out that 14%, you gave us the 15% last quarter on 2027, getting a lot of interest now on where you could ultimately go longer term. Your peers are flagging the mid- to upper teens in terms of ROTCE over time. Can you possibly talk about that? Help us frame is Truist positioned to operate in that range? And is that a reasonable range? And how do you think about that timing?

William Rogers
Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes. John, our business model, we sort of look at our business model, look at our level of capital. And past 2027, I just -- I don't want to sort of speculate as to what all those things might be. We might be in a different capital position, the business model resulting from the momentum that we're generating, quite frankly, the economic environment that we might or might not be operating at that particular time. And if you think about it, like for now, the ascension to 15%. So think about we start at 13% going to 15% plus our dividend. I think that's a really attractive path to that level. And as we get to the 15% and as we evaluate all the things I just talked about, then we'll look and see where we are at that particular juncture. I think it's sort of premature to sort of lay something out there that isn't as "locked in" as we think we are on the 15%. We want to have confidence when we say a number. We don't want to sort of be -- throw caution to the wind. We want to really be focused just like we are today.

The next question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.

Robert Siefers
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Let's see, I think you've touched or at least alluded to this briefly a couple of times, but just on the capital markets, I think there's just plenty of optimism about the industry's potential this year. That's, of course, an area where you all have invested really, really heavily. Maybe you could just sort of expand on your thoughts about momentum and potential there for the coming year.

William Rogers
Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes. Scott, I think as you pointed out, I mean, this is a business we've been investing in for decades. And I think we're in a really good position. We have really good momentum coming out of the second half of the year and quite frankly, on a lot of cylinders. So debt, capital markets, leveraged finance, M&A, all of our FRM derivatives, FX, all of those things are hitting on really good cylinders. And we come into it with a good pipeline. So we come into it with a good pipeline and not only the pipeline from the investment banking, but really the pipeline that's generated from our middle market and commercial client base. I mean probably what I'm most excited about is this organic activity that we're building.

We put talent on the field that really understands how to leverage all of our industry specialties, understands how to leverage our product and capabilities and position those and great advice for our clients with the appropriate teamwork that goes on and the technology that we built to support all that. So part of the double revenue story for us is we think we continue with a low double-figure kind of compound growth in this business. I mean I have every reason to be confident. It's organically built. We've hired some really good talent. You'll continue to see that, some really good talent. We've developed talent over a long time. We've got some senior leaders who've been in our business for quite a while. So this is a business I feel really confident in. I think we have a full capability and long-term continued high-growth potential.

Robert Siefers
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Terrific. And then, Mike, so on capital management, really robust repurchase plans and capacity. I guess as I think about sort of calls on capital or uses of capital, the loan growth outlook seems very prudent. You've got some things accelerating while you sort of dial back others. So I would guess the overall repurchase plan is a very sturdy one. But just as you think about the coming year, any factors that would cause you to toggle down or up that pace of repurchase to get to the sort of net $4 billion?

Michael Maguire
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes. Scott, again, the way we're thinking about this is we believe that, that 10% operating target or level is appropriate. We've sort of laid out a trajectory that gets us there by the end of '27. And so there are going to be moving parts as we go. If loans or the balance sheet grows a little faster one quarter versus another or we make a little more, a little less money one quarter versus another, and of course just the overall, I guess, economic backdrop, you wouldn't want to dismiss. But in a stable operating environment, we're going to trend to that 10% over the next 8 quarters. So if you look at the math, that gets you to about $1 billion a quarter this year, frankly, perhaps maybe a touch higher. And so that's really how we're thinking about it. It's just kind of retrending to 10% during that period.

The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.

Ebrahim Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

Two questions. One, I think just on deposits, talk about, like do you expect both as you move towards this wholesale mix on the lending side, what does that mean for deposits and deposit growth as we look forward, both in terms of the mix? So when we think about DDA noninterest-bearing balances and just the pace of overall deposit growth, do you think that kind of shifts for growth and how strong could it be?

William Rogers
Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes. Ebrahim, you're not talking about this. If you think about where we were a year ago with loans, can we build the momentum and sort of the asset-generating part of our franchise, and you see us deliver on that and then we pull that into this year and we pull that in the momentum and we optimize that. I think we're at the exact same place on deposits. I mean we're sort of same place. We're building that momentum. We're building that consistency. It's part of core to what we do. And then I look at the leading indicators on deposits and sort of think about, okay, what should give us confidence that we have deposit growth? First, I think there's been -- for the industry, so a little bit of a natural tailwind with QE and lower rates. I'll just sort of put that on one side.

But then idiosyncratic and specific to us, think about the momentum. We saw wholesale deposits grow 400 basis points faster in the latter part of 2025 versus '24. I mentioned earlier, 62% of our new clients came with deposits and we've had two times the number of clients. So we have a lot more clients, a lot more clients with treasury management products. And some of those are still funding. So they're in the funding base. So deeper penetration in the middle market base. We still have some loan-only clients that we're penetrating in that base. So in addition to the new, we look at the back book. End-of-period client deposits, we're up almost $7.5 billion. The other leading indicator is that treasury management fees, up 13%. And then you go to the consumer side, and we look at sort of the leading indicators there. And the first is net new. So we're adding net new clients, and the quality of those clients has increased year-over-year. So the amount of deposits that they're bringing to us increases year-over-year.

The focus on Premier, I talked about the deposit production being up significantly in Premier. The amount of off us deposits from our Premier client base is actually quite significant. So their capacity to use great tools to approach those clients has been really significant. Technology, digital account opening of branches, branch expansion, more marketing related to deposit generation, deposit generation in expansion markets for us like Texas and Pennsylvania. So just my net summary is we have really good momentum in the deposit side. And Mike sort of outline the deposit and loan correlation for this year. So we feel good about deposit growth, we feel good about that opportunity headed into this year.

Ebrahim Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

That's good color, Bill. And I guess maybe just a separate question around the wholesale strategy. On paper, $0.5 trillion balance sheet, you've been in investment banking for a long time. Truist should be winning in terms of when we think about fee revenue growth, financing. Just give us a sense, one, does -- do some of the changes by the OCC around leverage lending, does that create a slightly better opportunity to compete in terms of risk-adjusted returns? And remind us where you think the sweet spot for Truist is on the wholesale/capital market side. Is it against the Wall Street banks? Is it against middle market investment banks? Would love some color there.

William Rogers
Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes. Let me try to unpack that question. So on the leverage lending specifically, remember, that's been a core competency for us for a long time. So I don't see the guidance significantly changing our approach. Maybe there's something around the edge or that not, but we've been good in that business for a long time. And as you know, it's a really strong driver of our investment banking business as well. So I think sort of steady as she goes, continue on that front. And then in terms of our competitive position, the answer is to both. It really relies on a couple of things. I mean, I think what we want to be is sort of a couple things. One is the Premier middle market investment bank.

So think about that as sort of like the high bar in terms of standard and then really focused on places where we have specialization and a really strong right to win. So think about those combinations. So core middle market, leveraging our franchise. I mentioned earlier I've been really excited about the teamwork, the team that we have on the field, the training we put in place, the partnerships we have, the new talent we have that really know how to leverage the tools and capabilities for our sort of core commercial and middle market clients. And then anywhere on a specialty business, we have the right to win against anybody along that spectrum. I hope that clarifies it.

The next question comes from Ken Usdin with Autonomous Research.

Kenneth Usdin
Bernstein Autonomous LLP

Mike, just coming back to a prior comment you made, Bill had mentioned getting to the 3 teens NIM by year-end '26. And you had mentioned kind of remixing average earning assets with loans growing and some of the other categories coming down as an offset. So I guess just wondering how you expect average earning assets to traject off of the [ mid-480s ] exit? And also, like where's your landing spot in terms of securities and cash as a percentage of total assets as you do that remixing?

Michael Maguire
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes. Sure, Ken. If you think back to '25, you'll remember throughout the course of the year we brought the securities portfolio down really in the second half of the year from, I think, maybe the $125-ish billion ballpark down to the $117 billion, $118 billion. And so we would actually, I think, expect that to be relatively consistent in '26 at that $117 billion, $118 billion level. And so if you just do that sort of math on the year-over-year average, you've got essentially the securities and a few of the other earning assets categories down that 5% to 6%. So you couple that with the loan growth in the 3% to 4% area, you get to maybe, I don't know, ballpark, half that growth rate for earning assets.

Now the good news is, at half the earning asset growth rate of loans coupled with net interest margin expansion, that's what sort of gets you to the 3% to 4% outlook on NII for the year. In terms of mix, we've -- I think, relatively stable again is kind of how we exit '25. So we think about sort of the securities and cash combined in the $140 billion to $150-ish billion area. And so I think you'll see us there. That helps us sort of more than satisfy our sort of Lab and ILST requirements and we think it's sort of the right sort of place on the efficient frontier from an earnings perspective as well.

Kenneth Usdin
Bernstein Autonomous LLP

Okay. Got it. And then on -- and just on that updated slide you gave us on the fixed rate repricing and the swaps book, you still obviously have a lot of forward starting swaps relative to the size of the portfolio. Can you just help us understand like how that layers in? And how much of a benefit will just the former drag be in terms of a year-over-year helper this year, from the swaps?

Michael Maguire
Senior EVP & CFO

Sure. In terms of the active receivers, Q3, Q4 was actually flat around $50 billion. And you see that sort of gradually phase in throughout the course of '26. So I think we go to like $57 billion, $58 billion in the first quarter, then to $80 billion and $100 billion. I think we end the fourth quarter a little over $100 billion. So you do have a much more significant proportion of the swaps effective. Now at the same time, at least based on forwards, you've got the policy rate lower at almost sort of similar rate.

So what -- you start the year with less notional active out of the money, you end the year with more notional active and even slightly in the money. So the answer to your question on like what's the impact year-over-year, is it's a helper? Top of my head, maybe it's $100 million. But obviously, that's just one component of the balance sheet. And so you're thinking about with the policy rate lower 50 basis points, at least as we see it, you've also got the floaters, the cash loans, et cetera, going the other way. So all that gets taken into consideration in our outlook and how we're positioned.

The next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.

Michael Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Lot of talk about NIMs and returns and I was more focused on growth, and I know you're not satisfied with the growth and that you expect growth to be 2x in 2026 than 2025. So directionally, I think you're moving where you want to be. But when you give your revenue guide of 4% to 5%, that seems kind of in line, maybe below a couple peers for 2026, yet the population growth in your footprint is, what, 2x? So I'm just wondering -- and you're talking about the momentum you have in a lot of businesses for that growth, but do you need to increase your investments even more than you're already doing just to keep up with the bigger banks that are increasing their investments? And the 100 new de novo branches, why now? Where are they going to be? It's just a contrast versus in the prior 5 years of the merger when you're closing a lot of branches.

William Rogers
Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes, Mike, I think your basic question is, are we investing enough? And are we investing in the right places for growth? Let's sort of start with the concept of, as you pointed out, we're doubling revenue. So we are building momentum, building capacity to move forward. So the investments that we've made are reflected in that doubling of revenue. So let's sort of start as that premise is we are making investments that are mattering. The things that are -- I would consider to be significant, accretive market share, accretive kind of growth. If you think about investment banking, treasury management sort of in these low double-digit kind of categories, I mean, I think those are reflective of the fact that we're growing disproportionately and taking advantage of the opportunity that we have with our client base and with our markets.

And then when we unpack the expenses and unpack sort of where we're investing, it's a netting process. So remember, we're also continuing to create efficiencies in the company. So when we look at our overall expense level, that's a net number. We're creating efficiencies that not only came out of the merger but really came out of the work that we did in the end of 2023 when we -- as you duly noted, by the way, when we needed to really bend the expense curve, we bent that significantly, but we're still harvesting some of those savings. And then we look at the risk infrastructure that we built at our company, that's been a really significant part of the expense growth base over the last several years. While that will continue to be high and appropriately so, the rate of increase will low -- will lower.

So again, creating efficiencies to redeploy in things that matter. And then you've seen the things that we're investing in, I mean, go down the list, investment banking, talent, corporate banking, all the investments we're making in wholesale payments. I mean we're rolling out literally new products and capabilities every month. You've seen the investments we're making in digital, the growth we've seen in digital, marketing, Premier Banking, deposit growth, tech investments to create efficiency and effectiveness. And then on the branch side, this is a long-term game. So this isn't a quarter-by-quarter game. So for the past 6 years, we've effectively not invested or added net new branches into our branch network. So as the population shifts in our markets, as our focus gets really clear on things like Premier, we're going to open these branches in places that have the highest return for our franchise long term. So think about expansion markets, think about Texas in terms of examples, think about market demographics that have changed in markets like South Florida and markets like Atlanta where we'll continue to invest.

And then overall, in all of our markets, refurbishing. So I'm very confident that we're investing in the things that are delivering results, and I think you see that in the momentum we're building. And then we're putting a stake in the ground for continued momentum, doubling that revenue and creating this 15% return which obviously has those characteristics attached to it. So I'm satisfied and excited about the opportunities. And then put on top of that AI, other efficiencies and other opportunities, we're going to open up the aperture to continue to invest even more and with lots of clarity. We know the next place to invest, the next dollar to save, the next dollar to invest with a lot of clarity.

Michael Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And then -- yes, sure. And just, you keep mentioning the 15%. Seems like you're really hyper focused on the 15% return. Is that for the year 2027? Or is that reaching 15% at some time in '27?

William Rogers
Executive Chairman & CEO

The year.

Michael Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

For the year 2027?

William Rogers
Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes.

Michael Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And is that -- I guess that's not a final destination. When you announced the merger 7 years ago, you were talking over 20%, so I imagine you'd want to go higher after that.

William Rogers
Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean, different business model, in fairness, right. When we announced the merger, we had different businesses that had different return characteristics. So I think that -- as I answered previously, I mean, 15% is not the final destination, but the path from here to 15% is actually quite attractive from a shareholder perspective. I think as we get closer to that 15%, as we understand, as I mentioned before, economic environment, business model, where we see momentum, where we see a chance to put our foot on the accelerator, what we're seeing, the return on the branch investment, just talking about that as an example, then we'll start to hone in a little bit better about where that next stage of the destination is. I think -- I'm careful in saying final destination. I mean I don't think there's a finish line. I mean I think we're sort of constantly want to be improving and moving forward. The 15% was just to declare from here to there and the slope is, I think, actually quite positive from a shareholder perspective.

The next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.

Betsy Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just continuing along those lines, the question I have is just trying to understand how the efficiency ratio trajects as you manage through this process of driving up ROTCE and specifically also looking to understand the impact of the severance that we had this quarter when that flows through into the P&L, from a head count perspective. And how do you see head count trajecting and the efficiency ratio trajecting as you move towards the 15%?

Michael Maguire
Senior EVP & CFO

Betsy, it's Mike. I'll get us started. So on the efficiency ratio, look, we do expect to see sort of incremental improvement over the course of the next couple of years. I think that kind of mid-50s area is probably a reasonable expectation that's lined up to improving. Bill sort of talked about the numerator and sort of more throughput, more sort of, I'll call it, capital-efficient revenue. That's going to drive our ROA higher with sort of a similar level of capital over time. So gets you to that kind of off that 1% ROA higher and more in line with what it's going to take to get to that 15% level.

In terms of severance, the charges we took in the fourth quarter would have been related to actions in the fourth quarter. FTEs, there's a little bit of noise in that, Betsy, because we've got contractor conversions happening, we've got head count coming in, coming out. So in fact, you might actually see head count higher throughout the course of a year as we move from contractor to full-time employees. Now cost per FTE would go down, assuming we do a good job executing that strategy. And we can maybe throughout the course of this year, maybe give you a little bit more detail around how that's playing out.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.

Matthew O'Connor
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Little bit of a follow-up on the last question here. Just as you think about the restructuring and severance costs for '26, do you think there'll be anything meaningful? I think there was about $150 million this year. And I appreciate the guidance on a reported basis. Just trying to adjust for some of these items and see what the underlying operating leverage is.

Michael Maguire
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes. Got it, Matt. Look, I mean, first of all, appreciate the comment on sort of going to GAAP. This is something that we've gotten some good feedback on from investors and think it's going to be a more simple way to present our results. At the end of the day, the restructuring charges and sort of thinking about the -- originally, you recall, sort of the MRCs, they've just become sort of less significant relative to our overall story. That doesn't mean they'll go away. Obviously, we'll continue to have severance expense. We'll continue to have facilities-related charges and the like. But I do think that there is an opportunity and an expectation that they'll be lower over time. Difficult to necessarily forecast just given their nature. We do have an expectation that they'll be lower in '26 modestly. And again, it'll be sort of up to us to do a great job trying to create more opportunity there and beyond. So hopefully, that helps.

The next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.

Gerard Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Can you share with us, Bill and Mike as well? I guess, obviously, the outlook for yourselves and your peers this year looks really strong based upon the outlook for the economy, the yield curve, loan demand's picking up across the board. And if you have to look around corners, aside from the big geopolitical risks we all see, what are you guys keeping your eye on that could kind of surprise us later in the year? Because, again, the outlooks across the board look pretty darn good.

William Rogers
Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes, Mike, we can each talk about what keeps us up at night. So in terms of looking around corners, I mean, Gerard, I think this is what we get paid for. We look around a lot of corners. We stress for a lot of things within the business environment. I think to your -- point of your question, if you sort of said, number one, would be a more macro concerns and issues, does the economy hold up? Are we able to deploy all our strategies and our initiatives against the backdrop of an expanding and growing economy? So I sort of start with that because on the micro side, I feel really confident about the things that we're doing. So in terms of looking around our own corners, again, we'll stress for everything. We'll stress for credit, we'll stress for idiosyncratic things, we'll stress for geographies, specialties, all that kind of stuff. So we're always going to be looking at it.

But given the diversity of our franchise, those aren't my #1 concerns. They really are on the macro. Do we have the overall capacity to grow our business? And right now, the client sentiment's pretty good. And I would say in the macro, if you break it down, my probably #1 focus is employment. If I look at a number every day is employment. The index of risk to financial services, I think we all learned in the financial crisis was related to employment. So that's what I say really focused on will businesses still be confident to continue to hire, if consumers are confident that they have a job or can get a job or have a job and a gig job, then that confidence will stay and elevate it. So most of mine are macro. Mike, you might have.

Michael Maguire
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes. I mean this might err a touch too tactical, but I mean one thing that's on our minds here is credit spreads are still at tights. And so that's, I think, sort of the longer that stays that way that, in some respects, is a risk that we're absorbing. We talked a little bit about just the competitive nature of things, right? It's a fierce marketplace. And so we should all be up at night worrying about that. But Bill, I think you covered it well.

The next question comes from Saul Martinez with HSBC.

Saul Martinez
HSBC Global Investment Research

I just have a real quick one follow-up to Matt's question. Just to clarify, Mike, the guidance implies 12 -- call it, $12.2 billion to $12.3 billion of expenses. That does have some level of restructuring expenses embedded in it that are maybe slightly lower than this year. Is that right? Because obviously if it doesn't, it would imply something like 3.5% to 4.5% growth versus the adjusted number based on how you have been doing it. So I just wanted to clarify that.

Michael Maguire
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes. No, that's right. The outlook, so the 1.25% to 2.25% off the GAAP base includes what previously would have been outlined as restructuring charges or severance. In ex legal, that would be closer to 2.3% and 3.3% year-over-year.

Saul Martinez
HSBC Global Investment Research

Okay. All right. So it does include a similar number than this year. Okay. All right. I just wanted to make sure.

Michael Maguire
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes. Lower, sorry, just to clarify. [indiscernible]

Saul Martinez
HSBC Global Investment Research

Yes. No. Understood. A little bit lower. Understood.

The last question today comes from Chris McGratty with KBW.

Christopher McGratty
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

If I look at Slide 6, it looks like you grew net new checking accounts about 72,000 during the year. I guess 2 parts. Do you have that number for 2024? And then more broadly, consumer and small business checking accounts were modestly negative year-on-year. I'm interested in kind of the impact of the branch openings in reversing this and when you might start to see a kind of a tangible progress in those trends.

William Rogers
Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes, Chris, the net new in 2024 was about 100, if I'm going to sort of go from memory, so like right in that zone. But as I mentioned earlier, the quality of the 70-plus this year is much higher. So higher average deposit in those. And what we're seeing also is our pull-through is really higher with that. So the quality is really, really strong. And the diversity of where it comes from, so it comes from the digital channels. I talked about the significant investment there and also the branch network. And that leads to the -- to your next question is sort of about, what are we going to see from the branch investment or employment?

Keep in mind, we're just getting started. So like that data will come, we'll talk more about that. But the capabilities that we have now in our branches, I think some of the models that we used to use, I think we can sort of bend some of those curves because our ability to open accounts digitally in branches do more in a branch than we could do before, I think allows us to have a little more confidence in the return characteristics of those investments. But that's too early to tell right now. So we're building the models. We're getting started, great site selection, great markets and we'll keep you updated on where we go there. But overall, net new is -- continues to be strong and the quality is improving.
