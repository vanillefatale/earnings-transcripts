[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.

Joshua Raskin
Nephron Research LLC

I appreciate all that detail this morning. I was wondering if you could just give us a more updated view or a more specific view on the sub businesses in Optum Health. I'm specifically looking to understand how much of the revenue base is coming from capitated premiums from health plans and within that, how much from your biggest customer, UHC. And then how much of the remainder is fee-for-service billings from your employed physicians and then maybe some of the moving parts, I heard a little bit of the membership details as you think about stepping into 2026, at least directionally.

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

Sure. Why don't we just start with Patrick and then finish with Krista?

Patrick Conway
Chief Executive Officer of Optum Rx

That's great. So thanks, Josh, for the question. High level, the breakdown on revenue is as we described last quarter, 65% VBC, 15% care delivery fee-for-service and 20% are payer, employer services. Within VBC, it's about 2/3 of our book of business is serving UnitedHealthcare, the rest is diverse array of payers. Within -- the growth potential, as we close out this year, as you heard, we plan to close 2025 just under that 3% margin with VBC margins under 1%. And then we're taking the actions this year to set us up for '26, and I'll let Krista cover that portion.

Krista Nelson
Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Community & State

Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. So I think as we are pacing into 2026, we remain anchored and committed to the long-term potential of this business, the 6% to 8% margin that we outlined in the second quarter, and within that, the 5% commitment to our value-based care agenda. We continue to work a robust set of actions and opportunities with clear line of sight and frankly, a lot of the ambition to the work ahead. And, again, just remain optimistic on our positioning for the long term. Thanks for the question.

And we'll take our next question from A.J. Rice with UBS.

Albert Rice
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Maybe just I'll stick on the Optum theme. I appreciate the comments on Optum Insight and the comment about need for investment. Can you just sort of comment a little more deeply on your view of where Optum Insight sits competitively at this point? Where are those investments need to go and the time frame for seeing a reacceleration of growth there?

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

Sure. I actually think that Optum's competitive position is actually pretty strong. We have a really nice base of business and continue to grow that. But I think the potential is much greater. So Sandeep, do you want to offer some views?

Sandeep Dadlani
Executive VP and Chief Digital & Technology Officer

Sure. Thanks, A.J. Look, 4 weeks into the role, I'm super impressed with the talent, the domain knowledge, the customer franchise and the mission. I'm particularly excited by the momentum of some of our AI first new products in the portfolio. I mean just last week, you must have seen we launched Optum Real, which was inspired by innovation at UnitedHealthcare. This is the first real-time platform for claims and reimbursements anywhere in the industry. And just our early pilots are showing dramatic results in streamlining what I think is one of the most complex pain points for payers and providers.

I'll give you another example. We recently launched Optum Integrity One. This is the most advanced AI auto coding tool in the market, and it's driving demand among health systems and hospitals looking to improve middle revenue cycle automation and performance. Just some metrics. For ambulatory outpatient claims coding, this showed 73% productivity over prevailing solutions. And for hospital inpatient coding, it showed 23% increase in productivity.

A third one is Crimson AI. This is an AI first clinical analytics platform that has created 6 wins in the last 90 days itself. This helps providers with their surgical costs and operating room optimization. Just the average return on investment for any provider system investing in Crimson AI has been 13:1. So look, in my first few interactions with our top clients, they've expressed tremendous excitement and anticipation for our new AI-based offerings. They've also provided feedback on where we can do better.

But it's clear that our traditional services in Optum Insight have to evolve to AI-first services, then to products and eventually to platforms. We are well on our way with this journey. We're beginning to build powerful AI products like the ones I mentioned. We are rationalizing and modernizing some of the existing legacy products that have great market presence. And then finally, we're investing in an AI-first workforce. Remember, I come from the tech role where we built 10,000 AI builders and we're building AI-first sales teams.

So we are investing, as earlier noted, in building, growing new products and offerings, and I'm incredibly excited about the possibilities. We want to simplify health care with AI and Optum Insight is the best company to do it. Thank you for the question.

Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

First, let me congratulate and welcome Wayne back to the sector. Good to have you back. My question here is for Tim. Wanted to confirm, you talked about getting your commercial margins back to the 7% to 9% target range for 2027. Just wanted to make sure I heard that right. And then in terms of the current baseline for '25, I'm kind of backing into a margin in the 3% to 5% range for commercial, Tim. Is that in the right ballpark?

Timothy Noel
Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Business

Yes. Thanks, Justin, for the question. So the commercial business, as we've talked about, for 2026 and as a result of our pricing actions, we'll make meaningful progress as you think about the work being done across the ACA and the other commercial products to chip away at a return to that 7.9% long-term margin. We view 2026 as a year where we're probably still 150 basis points below that low end of the margin. But again, given how the pricing is being received in the marketplace, some of the opportunities that we see around controlling our costs in the future, we still feel as though that longer-term margin range of 7% to 9% is attainable.

Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.

Stephen Baxter
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just wanted to ask for some additional color on the membership declines you're expecting in Medicare Advantage in 2026. Can you help us think about the breakout between individual duals and group? And then at the industry level, CMS is expecting enrollment growth to be pretty flat in 2025. I guess, first, does the company agree with that assessment? And second, how are you thinking about the type of industry growth you might see as we move into 2027 and beyond?

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

I think Bobby Hunter is best for this [indiscernible].

Bobby Hunter
CEO of Government Programs & Head of Medicare Insurance

Yes. Great. Thanks, Stephen. So I'll hit the membership item first. Tim mentioned in the prepared remarks, approximately 1 million membership contraction for 2026 across MA. That does include both group and individual. Obviously, we've been pretty clear about the fact that we're exiting products impacting about 600,000 members. So think about that as kind of your first core element of how you build to that 1 million. And then I would say the balance of the bridge to the full 1 million is pretty evenly split between pressure inside of our group MA business as a result of taking a really disciplined approach to pricing there and some dislocation that will exist in the group customers as a result of some other more aggressive competitor actions.

And then the other kind of 50% of that bridge from the 600,000 to the 1 million representing a pretty even split across our individual MA business. Obviously, really early in AEP at this point, but that's kind of the way I see it from this distance. When you think about growth overall, I would expect 2026 to be probably more in line with the general progression and growth that we're seeing in 2025. And that's largely a result of continued benefit cuts in the marketplace, continued plan closures and then some disruption in the broker community related to pretty broad commission changes. I absolutely believe in the long-term growth potential of MA, and I think we can grow above those levels as you step out further.

Ultimately, right now, though, medical trend pressure is increasing the cost of health care and the funding cuts of the program are degrading choice, access and value to the consumer. And that's a real impact on the 35 million Medicare eligibles who rely on MA right now to make health care affordable. So still absolutely believe in the differentiated value proposition of MA, but cannot underscore the importance of stability in the program as we look to the longer-term growth rate and opportunity for MA. Thanks for the question.

Next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.

Kevin Fischbeck
BofA Securities, Research Division

I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Optum Health. The pullback in retrenchment and the refocus on certain types of plans, if we went back a number of years, who would have thought that value-based care could potentially serve the majority of MA lives. I mean is there a TAM that you're thinking about? Like what -- if you look at the markets today and the markets you want to focus on, what percentage of MA really lends itself to a successful value-based care model? And how penetrated is that today?

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

I'll have Krista respond to this, but I think we remain very positive and actually think MA should move more to value-based care and those themes just picking up exactly what Bobby said. So Krista, maybe you want to talk a little bit about the future of value-based care.

Krista Nelson
Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Community & State

Yes, absolutely. Kevin, thanks so much for the question. As we mentioned in our opening remarks, we are deeply committed to value-based care and research continues to validate the impact that it can have. We know fee-for-service rewards volume. We know that value-based care aligns incentives. And when you look across Optum Health, we've got an incredible set of assets that really enable an integrated delivery system to create value in the markets that we are focused in.

And so I just think about the potential. It really is limitless. I think what you're seeing from us is a focus and operating discipline and really kind of getting back to some of our core so that we are able to expand and grow in the future. And we're really deepening our presence in the markets. We're focused on the appropriate network, on the appropriate providers, on the appropriate risk, footprint portfolio so that we are positioned for long-term success inside value-based care.

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

Which implies you have to have it aligned to the right products, you have to have it aligned to the right processes and disciplines, and that alignment is literally what we're returning to. So good question.

Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.

George Hill
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

We saw a pretty significant step up in what I would call discretionary expenses in the quarter compared to Q2. You talked a lot about the need for investment in a lot of the business lines. I guess as you think about those numbers, can you talk about -- can you quantify the step-up in investments that were incurred in Q3? And how much of those should we think of as run rate investments versus onetime investments where we'll see leverage going forward?

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

Sure. Wayne, just take it.

Wayne DeVeydt
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks, George. I would say of the $450 million plus that we discussed, about 1/3 of that is a commitment to our foundation, which had not been funded at the levels that it should have been in the past and clearly puts us on a runway for multiple years of activities around the foundation. So view it as not necessarily run rate into next year, but nonetheless, something that we believe is part of our encore and core, and we'll continue to do it in the outer years.

The delta of that then is all investments in our people. You heard Sandeep talk a bit about Optum Insight, and that cultivated with the number of resources we have there and aligning incentives around the execution that we expect. So I would view much of that as being recurring in nature, part of our core business and the investments we'll continue to make in the expansion that we see both in Optum Health and in AI specifically.

Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.

Lisa Gill
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I just had a question around utilization and how to think about it here in the back half of the year. Clearly, this quarter came in a little bit better than what we were expecting, but we're looking at what's happening with the exchanges, looking at the step-up in Part D. So can you maybe just talk about your expectation going into the fourth quarter? And specific to Part D, are you expecting a big step-up as we think about the fourth quarter?

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

Tim, do you want to take this?

Timothy Noel
Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Business

Yes. Thanks, Lisa, for the question. So as I think about utilization, really tracking in line with the expectations that we called out in last quarter's call, really across all of the product lines, the general commercial business, including the ACA, as well as Medicare and Medicaid. And also on the Part D portion of the business, also tracking in line with expectations. Clearly, there is quite a bit of seasonality that's always at play in the health insurance business. I think you can think of normal seasonality, first half to second half, as 60% in the first half in terms of earnings contribution, 40% in the second half.

This year, given some of the trends that we've seen, a little bit more of a bias towards earnings in the first half of the year versus the second half of the year, but really kind of trends tracking with how we expected them to track, consistent with what we guided in the second quarter and the seasonality really just kind of a byproduct of the business. And also some of the additional spend that we have on things like a seasonal ramp in AEP with respect to Medicare.

Our next question comes from Andrew Mok with Barclays.

Andrew Mok
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I wanted to follow up on the Medicare Part D drug benefit for next year. It looks like the benefit for Tier 3 branded drugs changed from a co-pay to co-insurance across most of your MAPD and stand-alone Part D plans. Can you elaborate on your experience with the co-pay structure in 2025? And what drove that decision to change the benefit structure in 2026?

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

Bobby?

Bobby Hunter
CEO of Government Programs & Head of Medicare Insurance

Andrew, thanks for the question. So I would say just kind of big picture, we take a multiyear metered approach to our benefit planning that includes, as you can appreciate, managing and balancing many different variables, and that's particularly important given the dynamics around V28 and the phased approach there. The other element, perhaps, just to kind of call out, as you think about how we decided the modifications to make the benefit design for Part D in particular, for 2026, with some uncertainty around the demo program and how that would continue to persist or not into 2026. So we took what we felt was an appropriately kind of cautious approach there, pulling all the levers available to us to ensure that we would be well positioned on the overall benefit design regardless of how the demo came into 2026.

So as I look now kind of where we sit from a benefit design standpoint with the co-insurance we have on Tier 3, the deductibles that we have kind of broadly across MAPD and PDP, I feel pretty aligned to industry there. And I would expect us to have continued good performance as we step then into 2026. And as it relates to '25, really on the MAPD side, no concerns around selection, mix or outlook given the prevalence of deductibles that we put on our MAPD offerings. And on PDP, really kind of no material contributor or risk to rest of your outlook on that one either. So overall, feel pretty good about how we're stepping into '26 on PDP.

Our next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities.

Ann Hynes
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

My question is focused on Medicaid. At the last call, I believe, you said margins should be in the negative 1% to negative 1.5% range. Is that still a good bogey? And just like looking, with the One Big Beautiful Bill, is there anything that would prevent like a path to Medicaid margin recovery in 2007 (sic) [ 2027 ] and 2028?

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

Mike, do you want to take that?

Mike Cotton

Yes. Ann, thanks for the question. As Tim indicated, our view for Medicaid has not changed from last quarter. We expect breakeven in 2026 -- in 2025. As we think about 2026, we expect some margin degradation due to the continued dislocation of premium funding and what we're seeing in terms of elevated medical cost trends. But we do see 2026 as the trough for that performance. Our elevated trends are driven, as the industry has, by specialty pharmacy, behavioral health and also as we look at home health services. We think, over time, the One Big Beautiful Bill, there will be some transformation and work as we collaborate with states. But we see, over time, about an 18- to 24-month period, we will be able to return to a rate of margins of around 2%. Thank you very much for the question.

Operator

Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.

Lance Wilkes
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Could you talk a little bit about the employer market? And specifically, what's the medical cost trends you're seeing this year and next? And given the pressures on employers, what are some of the strategies they're looking at for the '26 and looking out to '27 on the selling seasons? In particular, any interest in adoption of value-based care? Are they using more Surest, things like that?

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

Dan?

Daniel Schumacher
Chief Strategy & Growth Officer

Yes. Thanks, Lance, for the question. Trends for 2025 and our outlook for 2026 remain in line with what we shared in the guidance last quarter. Trends are approximately 11%, and that is how we have priced into 2026, and I'll just share that. With 50% of our January insured business resolved at this point, encouraged by both the yield on persistency and rate to deliver the margin expansion that Tim spoke about in light of that trend of approximately 11%.

You're right, health care affordability is top of mind for all employers and we hear that this selling and renewal season, as we always do, but even a little bit louder given the trends and the pricing associated with it. Employers are evaluating a host of considerations. You referenced Surest, and Surest continues to be a leading product for us, continuing to capture share. And that has continued to grow and has a robust pipeline already as we look toward the jumbo selling season of 2027.

I might highlight some additional things that employers are looking at as well. Integrated advanced advocacy solutions that we sell in our product portfolio continue to capture employer attention as they help us bring together more synergistic approaches to care.

That includes value-based care, as you referenced, tighter coordination between medical benefits and Rx benefits, which employers are continuing to do on an increasing basis, as we see more and more employers moving to combining medical and Rx benefits and satisfied very much so with how we're advancing in that way with Optum Rx. So those are a couple of highlights that I would offer that are on top of mind for employers, certainly, for 2026 and already as we look forward into 2027. Thanks for the question, Lance.

Next question comes from Scott Fidel with Goldman Sachs.

Scott Fidel
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I appreciate the update on the capital deployment timing returning to the normal plan. Can you also just update us on sort of the dividend and what your view is on the dividend and that looking forward? And then curious just around -- I know that there's going to need to be possibly some portfolio rationalizations occurring in Optum Health and other businesses as you pursue the new approach. Is there a way that you can sort of frame that for us in terms of, I don't know, whether it's sort of revenue or just more philosophically, how you're thinking about the asset base in OH and maybe more broadly around where -- and around potential rationalizations that could occur?

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

Sure. The dividend, we'll start with Wayne and then I'll start with Optum and give it to Krista and to Patrick. So Wayne?

Wayne DeVeydt
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Steve. Scott, there are no changes in our historical dividend practices nor do we expect those to change going forward. We will maintain the dividend as we've done. The next prioritization, as we're paying down debt, will then revert back to the buyback program and then our strategic acquisition. So view it as no changes and then hopefully back into our normal capital deployment activities back half of next year.

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

And then just broadly, related to Optum Health, helping people understand, we are very much committed to this. We are just reshaping it back to the way we had originally conceived it and believe that it has the most impact on value and we're really just taking the right steps to bring that back into form so that we can really move and grow and advance it in the construct of that disciplined model we had going forward. So Krista, do you want to talk a little bit about that?

Krista Nelson
Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Community & State

Yes, I can just add to that. Thanks for the question. So yes -- so Scott, as Steve mentioned, we are really kind of taking a look at the whole like integrated delivery system. We have a combination of value-based care assets, some assets that are focused more on fee-for-service, but truly enable that value-based care agenda. And it's really important to ensure that kind of integrated model can deliver the best outcomes. And so as we're thinking about the portfolio rationalization, we taking into account a combination of things like where we have the right clinical quality, where we have the best operating cost performance, where we have the right engagement and where that model can really be brought to life for both value-based and those kind of fee-for-service service lines as well.

And so I think those are the ways in which we're kind of looking at the model. So it's a market focus. We are looking at rooftops. We are again looking at the populations, the risk, the products, and I think through all of that, there will be an output of some actions that we'll take in the near term to position us for long-term success of that integrated model.

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

Likely withdraw from a few geographic markets, likely reshape the practices within certain markets where we remain, likely shape, let's say, the primary delivery system along line with the complementary services, things along those -- that nature. All very logical, all actually more constructive, but to be constructive, sometimes you have to take some things away.

Patrick Conway
Chief Executive Officer of Optum Rx

In the -- to add one point across Optum and connect a couple of questions. In the face of escalating cost trends, what we hear from our payer partners, from employers and from patients and providers is they want a value-based care system that delivers better quality, better experience and lower cost of care. And that's what Optum is delivering to our various customers.

Operator

Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.

Erin Wilson Wright
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So I have a follow-up on that front. Is there anything you can quantify or break down for us in terms of those steps to turn around Optum Health? Like how much is just walking away from risk? How much is fixing the fee-for-service business? And presumably, that could be addressed a little bit quicker, right? And how much is just integrating into a consolidated operating model? And then what sort of incremental investments that you can quantify at this point that needs to go into that business as well? Presumably, does this all get you to 6% to 8% margin in 2028 and that's just back end weighted? Is that the right way to think about it?

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

I think directionally, I don't think we can achieve the level of precision you might be looking for something like that just because this does blend together. But Krista, do you want to respond?

Krista Nelson
Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Community & State

Yes. Yes, thanks for the question, Erin. So let me just kind of start where you ended, which is likely more back half weighted, but you should expect progress throughout here. And while we might see faster progress in some fee-for-service improvement, Patrick highlighted whether that's kind of productivity or scheduling or improving access or collection rate, you will also start to see some progress on our value-based portfolio as well.

So think of things like medical management, the work we're doing with our payers, the work we're doing to curate our networks, also the work we're doing to manage operating cost discipline. So these things really all come together in this integrated model, but maybe some faster progress in certain areas while you'll still continue to see kind of progress against the holistic model.

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

For example, you kind of -- a little bit of further ahead in the Eastern region on this and seeing some impact on that, and that's a good example of how this will progress, right? So a pickup in terms of volume there, greater capture, greater reach.

Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies.

David Windley
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

My question is related somewhat. But I think earlier in the call, you quantified that half of your headwind, I think the V28 headwind for 2026, you plan to mitigate through recontracting. And I wanted to make sure I understood, is that across the portfolio of payers? Are you mostly harvesting that from the UHC portion? The non-UHC portion? And then is the -- did I hear correctly that VBC lives you expect to decline by 10%? Is that interwoven in that at all?

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

So Krista, do you want to respond?

Krista Nelson
Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Community & State

Yes, absolutely. So yes, so -- like Patrick mentioned, so we sought to overcome half of the V28 headwind through our payer contracting efforts, which would include all payers. And we have completed that, and we're about 90% complete with our contracting with line of sight to the rest by the end of the year. So I feel good about that. That encompasses rates as well as product and benefits. And we've talked a little bit about some market exits inside of that. So exiting more than 40% of our PPO footprint was also kind of part of that exercise, but again, across all of our payers.

And then you asked about membership as well with the approximately 10% reduction as we pace into next year. Again, we probably will see even some additional PPO exit as part of the work we continue to do with all of our payers and the work that we're going to do to finish that work. But then that would be just really a direct result of actions we're taking to optimize our portfolio. So again, products, market, footprint and the risk that is appropriate for this model.

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

Leaning into products that lend themselves to management.

Our next question comes from Jessica Tassan with Piper Sandler.

Jessica Tassan
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Can you describe just the tone of any recent conversations you may have had with CMS, their receptivity and posture towards MA? What do you think CMS is focused on from a STARS risk adjustment and MA rate perspective? And what is UHC lobbying for?

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

You guys can decide which -- want to respond to that. We're not lobbying for anything in particular. So, please?

Timothy Noel
Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Business

Yes. Thanks, Jess, for the question. As I think about CMS receptivity, we've been encouraged and continue to be very encouraged of the receptivity of this administration to have conversations with industry about ways to modernize and ways to improve this already very popular program. This is in direct contrast to what we experienced over the previous administration. And we always enjoy and appreciate the efforts to be able to have these fact-based conversations around how to modernize the program and feel like that's the best way to get to a constructive answer and a constructive way to move forward.

So encouraged, again, on just the level of activity and the level of conversation that we have with the administration, and we'll continue to do that and continue to bring to them ideas that we think are ideas that are the best path forward that provides some level of stability for beneficiaries and also modernize the program in the process.

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

Yes, absolutely. So we have time for one question remaining.

Our last question comes from Whit Mayo with Leerink Partners.

Benjamin Mayo
Leerink Partners LLC, Research Division

All right. Tim, I was just hoping that you could comment more on the provider coding stuff that you were talking about. We hear pushback on that from many health systems. And then maybe any observations that you could share on the independent dispute resolution process and actions you're taking there or the impact on trend.

Timothy Noel
Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Business

Yes. Thanks for the question, Whit. So when I think about some of what we're seeing in trend, there certainly is a meaningful portion of it that is related to more service intensity per encounter being billed by health systems and by providers. Some of the ways that's coming through are higher-cost sites of service where lower costs are available. Think lab, think ER and surgery. I'm also seeing more services being attached to ER visits and hospital visits, an increase in the number of specialists that are rounding per inpatient stays and then a bias towards some higher DRG weighting than we've seen in the past. And it is happening fairly consistently across the country, but then also have some fairly -- very significant outliers.

And one part of what we're doing is we are addressing these outliers, we have to. We have to keep medical costs and health care affordable for consumers, affordable for states, the federal government. So we will be taking some network actions where we need you to keep health care affordable. We're also using -- making more use of AI in our payment integrity programs, increasing some of our payment policy efforts as well as our clinical affordability programs to address some of what we're seeing.

As I think about the IDR process, it's not something that would spike out in terms of a material trend driver from this distance, but certainly something that we're keeping an eye on pretty carefully.

Stephen Hemsley
CEO & Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman

Great. So thanks, great conversation today. That's all we really have time for. I want to thank you all for joining us, and we look forward to talking with you again and engaging with you before we get to January. And in January, we will provide both our year-end results as well as guidance for 2026. So thank you all for joining us this morning.
