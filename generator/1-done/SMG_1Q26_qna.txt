[Operator Instructions] Our first question coming from the line of Peter Grom from UBS.

Peter Grom
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Maybe just going back to some of the original commentary around the work the team has been doing. And I know we're going to get a lot more details at the Investor Day this summer. But just the high degree of confidence that you can outperform the guidance this year. Could you maybe just talk about what's driving that or where you have increased confidence and visibility, sales, margin, both? You sounded quite optimistic. So just any color, I think, would be helpful.

Mark Scheiwer
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Sure. Good to talk to you, Peter. This is Mark Scheiwer. I'll start with some of the bottom line confidence, and then I'll let Jim and Nate speak to some of the top line as they see it as they work with the operators. You'll see in the gross margin line, obviously, we announced the Hawthorne divestiture. So that, as Jim alluded to, provided 40 basis points of benefit on a full year basis. In addition, given our track record and some of our planning as we've gotten further into the year, we feel comfortable as we navigate that, that we should be able to outperform 32% as a number. So I feel as we guide further in the year, we'll give our customary update after the second quarter, and we can provide a little more refined guidance around, call it, margin. You did also see some good performance on interest expense down below the line as folks are navigating and managing cash flow really well.

So I feel really good about how the team is navigating free cash flow on that side. And then just from my perspective, on the finance side, on the top line, as far as consensus and where we landed versus sales and what we've talked about on the last quarter call sales from retailers, it's a big load-in quarter for the quarter, and we saw really good positive momentum there as we navigated the quarter, maybe that exceeded some of our expectations initially at year-end.

Nate Baxter
President & COO

And I'll just add real quickly, Peter, between the innovation we're bringing to market and the focus that we have in partnership with our retailers on the branded products, there's a lot of bullishness about the season. So we're -- I think all those things together is what sort of gives us our confidence.

James Hagedorn
CEO & Chairman of the Board

And look, I would just throw in there from my point of view that -- when we put sort of the guidance together, and this is not unusual for us. It's really before our business plans are being finalized. And we're through the process of the work we do with our retailers. So I think that they were pretty conservative numbers. And I think that's what you guys would expect. I think everybody is saying underpromise, overdeliver.

But between the guidance we gave and Nate's operating numbers, it's quite a big difference. And so Nate, I think, is feeling confident that we are at least better than the plan that Scheiwer would put together, which is kind of a safety plan. And so I think so far, so good. And again, the part which is that at the consensus, and this goes to, I think, mostly confidence in the numbers, we built an incentive plan that was approved by the Board recently that is the guidance numbers would not pay out at 100%.

And I think that's important to just know where the management team is because the incentive does matter. And so I think there's a lot of confidence. I think if sales were -- who's here, but is not talking at the moment. But if they were talking, they would say we've got excellent programs in place for the year. And I think the operating part of the business is being very well managed.

And our next question coming from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.

Christopher Carey
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. So I guess I sense some positive early signs of retailer shipments, both in the quarter and perhaps even quarter-to-date. I believe the year is set up to be a bit more back half weighted from a growth standpoint. Can you just give us a sense of whether the early activity has evolved your view about the phasing through the year, the timing of inventory loads? Or are these just weeks too small to read too much into and you're kind of still thinking the same thing? Maybe just give us a sense of how your thought process on the cadence has evolved through the year. And I guess that's really about your ability to kind of ship to retailers or retailers' receptivity?

James Hagedorn
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Chris, I would just throw out that it's no joke that the direction that I'm leading is going to be less focused on the quarters and I think it's a really honestly shitty way to run the businesses. And I know -- I think everybody would probably say that who knows our business and knows just generally public companies would say, don't let the quarterly results drive you guys and make your nuts.

And part of what I'm trying to get the operating team is to say, look, let's go for our milestones. Let's -- and so I think the answer is -- Mark will answer it, but I think the answer is yes, it's evolving and back to a more traditional kind of pattern than we had. But you get snow and in the Northeast and a lot of parking lots in the Northeast are going to be full. It will probably delay deliveries. And I think the answer is, it doesn't mean anything.

And so I think the answer is yes if you're seeing evolution in it and maybe it's just back to kind of a more traditional -- Mark and I talked about this yesterday. It's like what are you seeing on these patterns? Because I think Mark had sort of said, I think it will get back to kind of 50-50. And I said, is that -- do you see that really happening? And he's like, "Well, kind of." But I think the thing is we're looking for the fiscal year and making the sort of milestones that we need to get to, to make -- like I'm going to say, our plan work. And so I think generally, the answer is yes. But what I don't want to do is get all freaked out over the fact that there's just no doubt that you'll see deviation and a lot of it depending on weather.

Mark Scheiwer
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Chris, just as a follow-up to what Jim said, I think going into the year, when we talked at year-end, we kind of had talked about effectively like a 2% shift in sales from, call it, second half to first half. And I'd say we don't have a ton more data. The first quarter is a small part of the quarter. But could I see it being a little bit less than that? Yes. I think it could be potentially like a 1% shift first -- second half to first half.

So it could be a little bit less than our expectation. Just again, we're trying to navigate a few years being out from COVID now and sales patterns, but the retailers are really supportive of us. We have strong shelf space and support. And so that is very much the case. And so, could it be less than what we had talked about at year-end? I think it could be, but I think there'll still be a little bit of a shift.

Nate Baxter
President & COO

Yes. Just we ended last fiscal year in a really good place with retailer inventories where we were down, call it, 5%. So I think this just signals a little bit of optimism from retailers, making sure they have the inventory they need as we get ready for spring, so...

James Hagedorn
CEO & Chairman of the Board

I mean you've talked to the retailers. l mean after -- like how they are feeling about this...

Nate Baxter
President & COO

Good. And I think even some of them commented, we loaded in a little more than we thought we would. And I think it's because of the healthy inventory level and the optimism with The One Big Beautiful Bill, we're expecting some tax refunds. And I think retailers are bullish on the season.

Operator

Our next question coming from the line of Andrew Carter with Stifel.

W. Andrew Carter
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

So if I understand it correctly, if you want to add $1 billion from 2025 to the business and you think about where '26 will land, which will be a good base of branded, I'm getting like kind of a 6.6 kind of CAGR from '27 through -- or '26 to '30, who knows my math is right. But if I am in right range and that would be kind of an acceleration or at least the performance at the high end of what you expect the branded business to do this year? And how reliant is that on M&A? How reliant is some of these initiatives to be successful such as do-it-for-me and -- as well as the e-commerce initiative?

Nate Baxter
President & COO

So I would look at it this way. So first of all, a lot of the initiatives we talked about really won't be accretive until '27 and beyond. So the M&A and some of the do-it-for-me and Pro. What we are leaning into now is the e-commerce. And we saw -- Mark talked about it in his prepared remarks, but we saw, call it, sort of flat to negative 1% growth overall. Most of that was brick-and-mortar, but we saw double-digit growth in e-com.

And from a market share perspective, while we were flat in brick-and-mortar, we saw almost 2 points of gain in e-com. So Jim said it, it's about 5%, and that's really the path we have to get to. And I think the -- my operating plan for '26, as Jim said, is more aggressive. We can talk more when we do the Investor Day later this year, but we definitely have a plan we're willing just to talk through with you guys.

Mark Scheiwer
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. Andrew, as a follow-up, Mark Scheiwer here. You are right. You're in the ballpark as far as growth rates go. And on the finance side, as I kind of look at the building blocks, as we set up this year for '26, pricing is a building block. Volume growth is a building block and then innovation or new product listings are a building block. So if I was to break down that, call it, 5%, 6% of incremental sales growth, those three would be big components of that. We are introducing the tuck-in M&A as well as part of that. So that would be a part of that growth.

I think some of the partnerships we're looking at, I think it's safe to assume they would add probably a point of sales growth in the future as we navigate those partnerships and really like those businesses in the future. So those are probably the four biggest blocks every -- depending on the year, you may see some of them outperform. And then underlying it all, obviously, would be the e-com growth that you're starting to -- that you've been seeing in the past, call it, 6 quarters of our financial results.

W. Andrew Carter
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Then second question, I know that getting back to share repurchase this year. You outlined 40 million shares, which would be down 30% from where you are right now. I want to make sure I understand that the commitment to that and if that's flexible, like if you -- if the right M&A target came that, that would be off the table. And I assume -- I'm not sure how that would be treated given the trust ownership, but would the trust participate in that? I mean it would -- it might hurt the dynamics here if the trust moved up to 37%. So how are you thinking about all those things?

James Hagedorn
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. I put $40 million in this -- so it is a long-term commitment. I frankly had a bigger percentage reduction in the share count in mind, but I thought this was a good sort of moderate to long-term target that I think people could get their head around, and it sounded good to me. I think the limited partnership, not a trust, but the limited partnership would probably ride somewhere in the middle with probably a little bit of liquidity selling into it, but majority accreting through that. So I think that's what you're likely to see.

And then I it's where I am in my career. I've got to look to my partner that's sitting to my right side, Nate, and say,"Dude, I do not want you getting amnesia on the ship. I don't want you deciding," like to me, this is a really good strategy for us. If you look at the investment we're making in the business, it's like 3:1 investment in the business relative to the repurchase, okay? So I think a lot of people have said, "Are you sure you're investing sufficiently behind the business?" And the answer is absolutely.

Nate is comfortable with that. He's got to drive these numbers. I think Mark is comfortable with it. I'm comfortable with it. But I got to say, I have been the sort of architect of a lot of the M&A activity. And I think while putting Scotts together and sort of consolidating the United States lawn and garden market has been a good one for us. I think a lot of the other stuff, which would have been billions of dollars, maybe would have been better spent doing this then. And I think for where we are right now, this is a super simple, easy to understand, not challenging. It's a big deal for me to tell, "Scheiwer, you got the keys on this. And if you become uncomfortable, you can delay or stop."

And I don't want people to sort of get -- I'm not going to use the word distracted, but to become convinced that some giant M&A deal is going to be the answer to it. I think that we like this company, and I think -- we think investing in this company. And if we have to do M&A, like big M&A, $1 billion-plus M&A, we'll do it in this company. And there's no integration risk. We can do it. We can maintain our leverage. So I'm not going to say never because I think in sort of Air Force multiple choice test, the answer was don't ever answer that one. That's definitely a trick. So I'm not sure the answer is never, but I did make Nate promise me like you're not going to forget this commitment and you agreed.

Nate Baxter
President & COO

Yes. No. And look, I think when Jim shared his thoughts on the strategy, I think my response was something the effect of, "Hell yes, I'm all in." I mean that's really why I came here. And we really believe in the business, and we think it's the best business around. So we'll just invest in ourselves. And I am not worried about reinvestment in the business. Like Jim said, 75% of that cash flow will be supporting growth in the business. So I'm really comfortable with the plan.

James Hagedorn
CEO & Chairman of the Board

And just -- by the way, like I called Nate at 5 in the morning at his home, and he lives in this Loft thing in Columbus. So it's like a big rum, and he was like in the dark. And I sort of said, here's what I'm thinking. And within 10 seconds, he said, I'm in. And so that really is kind of how this whole thing started is calling Nate, getting his view, and it was just that quick. I'm in. And then we developed it, we started expanding it with the team, brought the Board in, and people are pretty happy with this. So my view is, this is our plan and we're sticking with it.

Andrew, what do you think?

W. Andrew Carter
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Well, I mean, I think that it sounds like we've got a nice opportunity cost filter for M&A now with a $1 billion share repurchase commitment. That's my first flush.

Nate Baxter
President & COO

No, I think it forces us to be really careful. And I think I said it in my prepared remarks, consumer-friendly tuck-ins that fill gaps or allowed us to expand adjacent, and we will not allow them to be accretive in any way. So I think it's a really smart approach.

Our next question coming from the line of Joseph Altobello with Raymond James.

Joseph Altobello
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

A couple of questions on the e-com business. I think you mentioned it was up nicely double digits this quarter. And I think you said it was 14% of overall POS. How big can that business be? And I guess maybe more importantly, what's the margin delta between e-commerce and brick-and-mortar?

Nate Baxter
President & COO

Well, look, I think the business can be huge. The lifts have occurred across all of our retailers. I think that's an important point to make there really leaning into it. Very little of it comes from direct-to-consumer. So I think, Joe, from a cost -- I mean, look, the retailers obviously are highly competitive and trying to figure out how to continue to lower their costs. But we see less than 5 percentage point delta in some of the margins, and they're getting better every quarter.

So as the big guys and you know who they are sort of invest in their infrastructure, we're riding along. And I think we're just seeing explosive growth, and it's not in just exclusive e-com. It's also in our traditional brick-and-mortar partners. We see a lot of opportunity. It will be a big percentage of that $1 billion will come from e-com from various retail partners.

James Hagedorn
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Look, I think that the -- if you look at -- I was at a top to top with Nate and e-commerce came up and Nate said, "we're underpenetrated. We've got to get to a level of market share in e-com that we have in brick-and-mortar." And nobody argued the point. But if you just use that and say our share is the same in e-commerce that it is in -- and this is true across retailer sites everywhere. It is a gigantic opportunity.

Nate Baxter
President & COO

More than half of that number.

James Hagedorn
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes, yes. So I mean that's the part. Now what's the challenge to Nate and his operating team, a lot of those SKUs are different. Their packaging is different. And so it's a lot of work. I mean we've talked about -- I mean, part of this is our own fault to some extent, which is where we are -- we're underpenetrated, that means other kind of hobos are overpenetrated. And that's a little hard to take. And I think in a world where brick-and-mortar was growing fast enough that it just was not a brick -- listen, we're simpletons here, I think, in some ways.

If you look at grocery, you look at e-commerce, we were doing incredible work in brick-and-mortar, and we have fabulous partnerships with big retailers. And they are absolutely our best friends. And they're building out this stuff, too. But there's a lot of work for us to say we, let's just say, deserve to have market shares in e-commerce that we have in conventional retail. And that's going to require change in Nate's organization and a level of entrepreneurship that says we're going to get quite a bit more scrappy because otherwise, it's just like everything else we've talked about, whether it's grocery or e-com, like if you want to succeed there, you have to have products and market and talk to people who are shopping there.

Nate Baxter
President & COO

Yes.

Joseph Altobello
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Very helpful. Maybe if I could follow up on that. Obviously, we're here in late January, but how are your retail partners thinking about the lawn and garden category this spring given all the affordability issues and pressures on the consumer right now?

Nate Baxter
President & COO

Well, look, I spend a lot of time with our retail partners. I think everybody is feeling bullish. I mean it's the same story. It's a big part of bringing consumers back into the stores and online. And I think they absolutely see those investments as worth it. I don't know, Josh, do you want to make a comment on that?

Josh Meihls

Yes, Josh Meihls, here. I would say retail partners are very bullish on lawn and garden. To reiterate Nate's point, they see it as a traffic driver into the stores, a traffic driver to their e-commerce in financial times like this, relatively unburdened by small projects, paint, lawn and garden tend to overperform, and that's where our retailers are leaning in to drive that traffic and conversion for both in-store and online.

And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Matuszewski with Jefferies.

Jonathan Matuszewski
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

My first one was on supply chain. You've outlined a multifaceted plan here, everything from automation to more capacity and SKU rationalization. Any way to rank order some of these things as we think about kind of the biggest opportunity for cost savings and gross margin ahead? That's my first question.

Nate Baxter
President & COO

Thanks, Jonathan. Look, I think they're all important. I think if you look at the performance we delivered in last year, I think our team is pretty confident they can continue. As you recall, we overdelivered. I think we ended up with $100 million out of supply chain, including commodities last year. We've got $50 million to go in my original challenge. There'll probably be another challenge coming. It's a little bit of everything everywhere.

So remember, the way we approach, for example, efficiency in our plants, a lot of these plants are 50 years old and the equipment is nearly that old. The way Josh sort of manages that is when we have to replace a line, a bagging line, it's going to be a more modern, obviously, line that has probably at least a 20% to 30% improvement in throughput. So it's really the sum of a lot of small changes. Some of the bigger areas are automation in our distribution center. I think you know we've been on a journey. So we'll continue to deliver results there.

And then our tech transformation, I mean, we are in the process of completely reimagining all of our business processes. It's part of our ERP migration, but it's more than that. It's including how do we reduce the number of touches on any given project, whether it's a finance project or a marketing one. So I don't know if I can rank order them for you, but what I can say is I have a lot of confidence that these initiatives are going to continue to help drive the bottom line.

Mark Scheiwer
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

And Jonathan, this is Mark Scheiwer. The other components of improving gross margin at the COGS line are going to be -- continue to be fixed cost leverage. As we automate and get more efficient in our factories, we should be able to push more product through those, both distribution locations and factories. So we should get fixed cost leverage benefits going up and then innovation as we look to continue to do cost out in our products and continue to make them more stronger, better and all that. So I would say those two things also are part of that journey.

Jonathan Matuszewski
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up here. Pro penetration continues to rise at your key retail partners. Just curious, what are you doing different to collaborate with the big retail partners of yours to move Scotts to the consideration sets of more of their Pro customers versus DIY. Presumably, this would be something in addition to the DIFM efforts you're pursuing in those pilot markets you mentioned.

Nate Baxter
President & COO

Yes, Jonathan, I mean, I don't want to get into specifics, but clearly, our big retail partners have big Pro initiatives. And I would say the way we're addressing that is product development, looking at larger sizes, more value to bring to the Pro side of the market. But as you point out, it's a multipronged approach. We'll work with retail partners. We'll also work directly with small and medium-sized businesses.

But at the end of the day, again, we're agnostic of where they get our product. So we'd just want to make it available in channels that makes it easy for those pros and do-it-for-me businesses to thrive. And so it will be pretty broad. I think I'll leave it there. We'll probably have more to talk about this summer when we do our Investor Day in that space.

Operator

Our next question coming from the line of William Reuter with Bank of America.

William Reuter
BofA Securities, Research Division

I just have two. The first, Mark, when you were discussing M&A, you mentioned 1% growth. So is that to say that, that 5% annual growth target includes about 1% annually?

Mark Scheiwer
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

That's correct. Yes, that would be out into -- not this year, but it'd be focused on '27 and beyond.

William Reuter
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. And then when we've been discussing the incremental $50 million of cost savings in one of the most recent answers, we talked about the $50 million that we still have. It seems like some of those are investments that are in the CapEx line. Will CapEx remain elevated in future years? Or is the elevated CapEx really related to the $50 million of cost savings that we're targeting this year and then we'll move back towards maybe $100 million or lower?

Mark Scheiwer
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

We're still building out, I would say, like our 5-year road map as far as long-term plan, but I would expect our CapEx to remain elevated at, call it, $130 million in '27 and beyond and as we look to automate not only our factories, but also our back-office activities. But in the near term, as what I'm seeing in the business and what we're working on, I would say, for the next several years, that's correct.

Nate Baxter
President & COO

Plus there's the ERP component over the next, call it, 2 to 3 years that will be part of that CapEx as well.

Operator

Our last question will come from the line of Yaakov Musheyev from JPMorgan.

Carla Casella
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

This is actually Carla Casella from JPMorgan. Just your thoughts in terms of the longer-term capital structure, and you mentioned your leverage target, but you said how you're going to address the 2026 maturity?

Mark Scheiwer
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Sure. Carla, this is Mark Scheiwer. So the 2026 maturities, we plan to -- you saw on our balance sheet, they moved to current. Our expectation is, we would leverage our free cash flow generation that we generate over the summer that's built into our $275 million of free cash flow plan, along with access to our revolver to pay those off later this summer as they start to come due. So we'll do that in the summertime and leverage, again, free cash flow and then access to our revolving revolver.

Carla Casella
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then you mentioned you're going to post financials, excluding Hawthorne. But can you just give us a goalpost for what EBITDA was last year with Hawthorne? I'm kind of backing into like 100 -- or sorry, $530 million. Does that sound like the right range?

Mark Scheiwer
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. So last year, we had adjusted EBITDA with Hawthorne of $581 million. We're still working through the finalization of the recast, but I would expect it to probably decrease by approximately $11 million when you back out the Hawthorne. So call it around $570 million from an EBITDA perspective for the '25 -- fiscal '25 recasted number. And we'll provide you the '24 number in those materials as well, but that would be the '25 number.
