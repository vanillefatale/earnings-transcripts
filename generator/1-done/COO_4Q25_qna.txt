[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird.

Jeffrey Johnson
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Congratulations on the progress in the quarter. Al, I wanted to talk, I guess, first on clariti, obviously, a good MyDay number in the period. Did you give a number for how much clariti was down? And I think that's been about a $400 million annualized line for you guys. What is maybe the floor on that? And as that continues to come down and MyDay grows, do you see those MyDay gross margins eventually within the next year or 2 getting to clariti gross margin levels?

Albert White
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes. I'll let Brian comment on the gross margins because we made a lot of progress there. Yes, clariti was down a couple of percent this quarter, and it's approach -- it approached $400 million this year. So it's still a pretty sizable product line for us.

We're doing a lot of work on it right now. We've got some new products that we're launching we're excited about. The 3 Add multifocal in the U.S. is being received really well. But on the flip side of that, we're doing some repositioning in places like Asia Pac to put that lens family more in the entry-level space that we want it to be. And so we're going to continue to have some push and pulls here, I think, over the next couple of quarters.

But I do still think that there's a place for that lens and has the opportunity to be very successful. If there's ever a situation where the market moves a little bit more towards mass market or is a little bit more price conscious, I think you'll see that lens take off. But in the meantime, to hit on the start of your question, Jeff, yes, good quarter for MyDay. We are making a lot of progress there. We have a lot of really exciting stuff going on. Do you want to comment on the margins?

Brian Andrews
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Jeff. I won't comment on individual product line gross margins, but I will say that the gross margins for the family of products of daily silicone hydrogel lenses, is below CooperVision's gross margins.

I talked about mix being part of the reason for the gross margin decline in Q4. It will be part of the reason for the gross margin decline year-over-year next year. And as we sell more daily silicone hydrogels, I would expect that we'll still have pressure on the gross margin line.

Now that being said, we do get more revenue per patient. When we sell daily SiHys, we get more gross profit dollars, and we get more operating income dollars.

And so as we leverage our prior investment activity and a more streamlined organization, I would expect we'll be able to drive operating margin expansion and earnings growth despite some of the headwinds we'll be seeing from the gross margin line.

Jeffrey Johnson
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

And maybe just one quick follow-up. Just whenever you guys give calendar versus fiscal numbers, it always opens it up to a question like this. But if you did 5% growth in calendar 3Q, Al, and you did 3.2% in fiscal Q4, it would seem to imply a pretty weak October, I believe, if I'm thinking about that correctly. But just tell me why I'm wrong there or at least kind of help reconcile those 2, the 3.2% and the 5% numbers.

Albert White
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes. It was the flip side, Jeff. It was actually the beginning of the quarter. The overlap in the beginning of the quarter, not the end of the quarter. October was a good month.

Our next question comes from Lawrence Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.

Larry Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Al, could you please talk about the strategic review? How long will it take? And what's your reaction to those who have advocated for splitting up CVI and CSI and adding new Board members?

Albert White
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Sure. We announced a strategic review for those who haven't seen, and we issued a press release concurrently with the earnings release. We're going to take a look at options out there because we do want to drive shareholder value, right? And we look at that. And we were doing that work proactively with our Board over the summer. We actually presented strategic analysis and a strategic review to them in the month of October, and we obviously put that out publicly.

We'll provide an update on any activity on our next earnings call, which is the beginning of March, that's our Q1 earnings call, unless something material happens beforehand. And if it does, obviously, we'll issue a press release or make a statement on that.

So outside of that, I'm not going to comment too much on it, but yes, it's underway.

Larry Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So Al, no comment on -- I mean just maybe your latest thoughts. Obviously, there's -- there are others out there now advocating for splitting up CVI and CSI. Has your position changed? Just love to hear your latest thoughts on that. And I'll leave it at that.

Albert White
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes. My position has not changed on that. We discussed that actually, Larry, at your conference in September, you raised it, and I gave my opinion on that. And my opinion has not changed, which is our job is to drive long-term shareholder. If taking certain actions are beneficial for our long-term shareholders then we need to evaluate those.

As I talked about in the September meeting that we did, I believe if we drive value in this business that we'll maximize long-term shareholder value. And that's what we're doing. That's what we did with the reorg. That's what we're doing with stock buybacks. That's what we're doing driving cash flow. That's what we're doing in a whole slew of different ways.

But we're going to look at the value of this business and do what's best for our long-term shareholder -- long-term shareholders. That's our job as executives of a public company.

Our next question comes from Jon Block from Stifel.

Jonathan Block
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Al, I think your contact lens market growth expectations for 2026, I think you said for the market, 4% to 5%. Year-to-date, the market's 4%, and I don't know, it just seems like industry pricing power is fading a bit.

So just talk, if you don't mind, about sort of the market growth assumption or construct, like what's behind that assumption if we do finish this year 4% or even a tad below, what's responsible for market growth acceleration if pricing power is decelerating? And then I'll ask a follow-up.

Albert White
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Sure. Yes, Jon, I might go the other direction a little bit on that one. We grew -- as a market grew 4% in Q1, calendar Q1 and 4% in calendar Q2. The market grew 5% in calendar Q3. So it actually increased this last quarter. I do think that we're going to be in a 4% to 5% market growth for this year. I'd be really surprised if we're not.

From a pricing perspective, I think global pricing for next year will end up being somewhere around that 1% on a true global net basis, so probably pretty similar, frankly, to what it was this year, which leads me to believe we'll probably be somewhere in that 4% to 5% range next year.

I do think this quarter, which was 5% was probably a little bit better representation of where the market is. So I'd say 4% to 5%. But honestly, I think it will be closer to 5% next year.

Jonathan Block
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Fair enough. And then just to shift gears, I take like a different approach in terms of going to CVI numbers for you guys rather than from like a product standpoint, just from a geography standpoint. I mean, APAC falling around 0% for fiscal '25. It was up, gosh, 7% in '24. And then at some point, this thing was growing 13%, 14% in the prior year. So for fiscal '26, is -- it seemed like more the same argument in Americas and EMEA for the most part, but we just see that APAC clawed back a little bit closer to mid-single digits, a function of MyDay, but also a function of getting some of these quasi one-timers behind you. Just looking for any direction from a geographic perspective.

Albert White
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes, I think you're right, Jon. At the end of the day, we had some struggles in Asia Pac this year, it was heavily focused on the pure play e-commerce channel. That's where we lost share.

I mentioned that China was down 28% in Q4. As you remember, it was down kind of mid-20s in Q1 and Q3. So our China business is quite a bit smaller this year than it was the year before and again, heavily focused on low-margin business. That's the reason that you've seen our revenues come down and be a little bit softer, but you haven't seen the impact on our profit.

Now we clearly do not chase revenues at all costs. We would never do that. And that's a great example of where we don't do it. We don't -- we're not chasing the market where we're seeing some participants with super aggressive pricing out there.

We're maintaining fiscal responsibility and sensibility around how we operate. What I will say is as we move into fiscal '26 is these markets, like China and the pure-play e-commerce and some other markets, have become a much smaller percent of our overall business. So we're not going to see the same detriment in '26 that we saw in '25.

Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan.

Lilia-Celine Lozada
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

This is Lily on for Robbie. The guide is a bit more back-end loaded from a revenue growth perspective. So what gives the confidence in growth stepping up over the course of the year? And what are some of the variables across Vision and Surgical that we should think about as improving over 2026?

Albert White
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Sure. Thanks, Lily. It's a little bit back-end loaded, but it's not that much back-end loaded. I mean we intentionally did not get overly aggressive on Q3 and Q4 so that we wouldn't have a situation where it was heavily back-end loaded. Even though, frankly, I'm pretty optimistic we're going to have a strong Q3 and Q4 given where MyDay is today and the momentum that we're seeing.

But to answer your question, it ties to that. It ties to the MyDay sales that we have right now. The momentum that we're seeing out there, we won a number of additional private label contracts during Q4. As I mentioned, a number of those are in the U.S. and in Europe. So a number of people on the phone will start seeing some of those as we get into 2026.

So I'm excited about what's going on with MyDay and the progress that we're making. And that's going to be one of your biggest drivers that's going to push forward the CooperVision business.

When it comes to CooperSurgical, we're forecasting a relatively similar year next year to this year, and that includes kind of being conservative on fertility. I mean I'm optimistic fertility picks up. And we certainly have easier comps that we're going to report against that's going to help us a little bit. But we want to stay a little conservative on fertility also in consumer spending.

When I think about CooperSurgical, remember that we launched the single-hand inserter for PARAGARD at the beginning of last year. So we had a really strong Q1. That's the reason that we're guiding a little bit softer here for Q1.

Having said that, PARAGARD just had a really strong Q4 and finish to the year. So we'll see how that plays out because frankly, guidance for CooperSurgical assumes flat to low single-digit growth in PARAGARD, and we did quite a bit better than that this year.

Lilia-Celine Lozada
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, I was hoping you could talk a bit more about the improved free cash flow outlook. What's driving that increase relative to the prior guide? And is any of that step-up coming from decreased investment in SG&A or R&D?

Albert White
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Sure. Yes. The way to think about free cash flow is it is not back-end loaded. It's just consistent performance, consistent execution. We'll step up nicely this year by continuing to do exactly what we've been doing. I mean we just posted the $150 million in Q4, which was strong, and we're going to continue to post strong quarters here by delivering earnings growth, by doing some of the working capital management that Brian mentioned.

And then as we move into next year, you're going to see CooperVision's CapEx come down. Our maintenance and growth CapEx is about 5% of revenues. It's somewhere in that range, right? And we've been running upper single digits. So you're going to see that come down as we make final payments on our MyDay lines this year.

And then we're also completing some relatively significant business activity. And the last thing we really have this year is our new CooperVision R&D facility going up. So as those roll off and you continue to see profits grow, 2027 is going to be a nice free cash flow year.

And then I think it's just more consistency in the next year. So we're saying over $2.2 billion now. Frankly, we feel pretty good about that number, the over on the $2.2 billion side of it.

Our next question comes from Jason Bednar from Piper Sandler.

Jason Bednar
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

I wanted to start first with -- I think I heard you right, there aren't any repurchases assumed in earnings guidance for fiscal '26. But I thought you referenced in the supplementary PR today that you're allocating free cash entirely to repurchases. So just how to reconcile that. Is that just conservatism? Or do I ask something incorrect there?

Albert White
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes. So we spent about 2/3 of our cash flow this past year on share repurchases, and we're targeting spending about 2/3 of our free cash flow on share repurchases in '26. That will be EPS-accretive. We did not include that in the guidance range.

Jason Bednar
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. All right. Got it. And then as a follow-up, Al, good to see the TSR addition to the comp plans, I think a lot of us will be happy to see that. I did want to ask, just if you could discuss how you landed on Colleen as the next Chairman for the business.

I know it's maybe a bit of a hot button issue right now, just given some of the items out there in the public domain. But if you could just discuss why that was the right move for the Board in the context of other options, whether currently on the Board or not on the Board?

Albert White
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Sure. We've been having conversations over the last year with Bob. And it's driven by Bob. I mean Bob is a great guy, right, he has a ton of value, but he's gotten to the point where he's saying, hey, I want to go into full retirement. And it's that time for me.

So we were talking about it in the context of transitioning the Chair leadership over and how that should happen and when that should happen. And this was the right time to do that.

Colleen has been with us for a number of years. She's fantastic. She's supersmart. She was a top executive over at Procter & Gamble. She's got a global experience. She's got branding experience. She brings a lot to the table, and she just does a really nice job.

And she -- as I said, she adds a lot of value across the board, which is great. She was the one who probably 6 months ago, brought up the TSR and said, hey, we need to roll the TSR into here and look at shareholder returns and make sure we're aligning executive comp even closer to the stock's performance. And she brought that together with our consultants and so forth and put a plan together.

And yes, as I mentioned, we're going to be rolling that in. So I think she's the perfect person to step in as the Chair. And Bob's going to -- Bob's plan is to continue to work with her and transition the role over to her to ensure it's just -- it's a really smooth process.

Our next question comes from Travis Steed from Bank of America.

Travis Steed
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just curious on what the strategic review, your willingness to take short-term dilution to create longer-term value and how you kind of balance the short term with the long term? And also how you think about consolidation in the contact lens space? Are there potential synergies there or antitrust risk with actions like that.

Albert White
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Well, I think that -- I mean you're always going to have some of those questions around short-term investments and short-term activity and the impact on the long term, be it across the board, right, product launches or product development or any number of moves that you can potentially make.

So I think the important thing is what we said, which is, hey, we've done some work on a strategic review here. And people have asked the question about what does that mean, what actions can you take and so forth.

And what I want to be clear about and that we issued the press release, is we've done a bunch of work on that. We're rolling up our sleeves to do more work on that. And we're taking a serious look at all the different alternatives that are out there, be it a number of things, frankly, that we put in that press release.

So I'm not going to go into all the details behind that other than to say, we are rolling up our sleeves. We're working with our advisers. We're looking at the different alternatives that are out there, and we want to ensure that we're driving long-term shareholder value, and that's our heavy, heavy focus.

Travis Steed
BofA Securities, Research Division

That's fair. And then gross margins down in '26. Just trying to understand exactly how you're getting operating margin leverage. Is SG&A not growing on '26 and how much are you going to be cutting in the business.

Albert White
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Well, sure. I mean I think when you look at it, you can just plug the numbers in, and you can see that OpEx itself or SG&A, if you will, is not going to grow very much because that's where we're set right now.

So this is not additional cuts. This isn't like we need to go do things. We had this reorg activity planned out a while ago, and we completed it aggressively. And I think the team here did a fantastic job doing it aggressively and getting it done. And you can see that in the SG&A or in the OpEx, if you will, in our Q4 as-reported results and you should assume to continue to see that level of excellence in terms of spending, supporting the top line and driving leverage on a go-forward basis.

Question comes from Matt Miksic from Barclays.

Matthew Miksic
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

So one follow-up on an earlier question around your sort of intention expectation of gaining share here in the fourth calendar quarter.

Maybe just talk about where you see the various business lines inflecting this is envisioned obviously. Just some color as to which catalysts do you think are kind of lifting off a little bit in the last month or so of the year.

And then I have one follow-up.

Albert White
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Sure, Matt. That's a really good question. You'll remember last year in Q4, we did not have a particularly good quarter. We had some competitors launching product and they had a lot of activity going on, and it was one of the weaker quarters that we've had with respect to the market in a long time.

So we are comping against that. And we are in a significantly better position in this calendar Q4 than we were in last calendar Q4.

So what it comes down to is just weakness last year and strength this year, and a lot of that ties right to the topics we've been discussing starting with MyDay. So I do think we have an excellent opportunity to close this calendar year strong.

And when you compare that to last year's weakness, it should be a pretty good number. Well, I said it in the call, like we're 17 straight years of market share gains, and we have not given up on making that 18. So we'll see how things close out.

Matthew Miksic
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

That's great. And then the follow-up, your question earlier on this as well, the sort of separation, you've talked about it, you've answered how you feel about it creating shareholder value.

Given that it's been sort of -- it feels like these reporting lines and operating-wise, feels like it has been running separately or independently in many ways and some might say ready to separate for some time.

What -- if that's the case, if you looked at this before, what is changing now given sort of the new Board involvement and new investor involvement that you think could make this possible now? From a tax basis, is it -- is the restructuring done and it's a tuned up upgraded portfolio that we think will get more interest? What would you say?

Albert White
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Well, I think that -- I mean if you talk about a separation, it is a negative and that it will create dissynergies. It is a negative from a tax perspective. Having said that, you've seen a number of companies, whether it's in the med device space or MedTech more broadly or even just more broadly just saying companies who have looked at their portfolios, who have different businesses within their -- under their umbrella, so to speak. And they've looked at different ways to say, hey, I want to try to unlock value. And I'm going to spin off my diabetes business, or I'm going to spin this off, or I'm going to spin that off. I'm going to look at different strategic alternatives. I think that's good hygiene. I think that's important to do. And it now is an appropriate time for us to do that.

We made a ton of progress at CooperVision to position ourselves here to really get growing again and taking market share. And we made a ton of progress in CooperSurgical with our fertility business. And we're going to do great in fertility.

So I think when you look at the businesses right now, it's just fair to ask the question, which is, are there strategic moves that we can make unlock shareholder value. And that's one of them. And I think it's important for us to roll up our sleeves and evaluate that, and that's what we're committed to do.

Our next question comes from David Saxon from Needham & Company.

David Saxon
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Maybe I'll start with CSI just on PARAGARD. Al, I think you said flat to up low single digits for fiscal '26. It looks like the competitive IUD is going to launch in the first half of calendar '26. Is there anything embedded in that PARAGARD expectation as it relates to that launch?

And then when you first acquired it, you talked about the margin profile really strong. Has there been any meaningful change to that margin profile? And then I have one follow-up.

Albert White
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Sure, David. A couple of things. Yes, there is the competitor product that was approved. I have no idea if it's going to launch or when it's going to launch or anything else about it.

We did factor in some conservatism, if you will, into that -- into the -- my guidance of kind of flat to up a couple of percent, assuming that there is a competitive launch.

Now I'm forgetting off the top of my head, Brian will probably know. I think PARAGARD grew 7% this year. So I'm optimistic we'll have another good year. But yes, we did factor in a little conservatism around the potential for a competitor launch.

I will say the margins have come down a little bit because of the single-hand inserter launch, that activity. Nothing that I would classify as material. But yes, the gross margins are a little bit lower on that product.

David Saxon
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then just on CVI. So the Asia Pac e-commerce dynamics, I mean it sounds like we'll lap that in the fiscal first quarter. But any residual impact from like the distributor channel inventory dynamics you talked about a couple of quarters ago or the private label conversion from clariti to MyDay. Just how we should think about those moving pieces as it relates to fiscal '26?

Albert White
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes. As we think about that from an Asia Pac perspective, I think you're still going to have a little bit of that noise, frankly in Q1, and we factored that into the guidance, right? We did 3.2% globally, and we factored in 3.5% to 4.5% as a company, and we factored in continuing weakness in Asia Pac in Q1.

So whether we see that or not or how much that changes like we'll see and we'll play that out. But you can see some of that, I think, as you continue to transition.

Our next question comes from Young Li from Jefferies.

Young Li
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I guess to start, maybe a question about the pipeline. I did hear that you're launching some new products that can contribute to growth. But some of your competitors have been talking more and more about next-generation contact lenses and materials. I was wondering if you can comment sort of where you are with your program?

Albert White
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Sure. We have some great stuff going on in R&D. A couple of things that I'm not going to get into, but that I'm super excited about. We have some launches going on right now that I talked about. We have some stuff like MyDay, MiSight. I mean that is like market-leading innovation.

First of all, we're the only contact lens company with an FDA-approved product for myopia control in MiSight and now we're launching MiSight on the silicone hydrogel platform. We're one of the leading brands out there in MyDay.

I mean you can't get much more exciting and innovative than that, and that's coming here in Q2. And we've got some other really cool innovation and stuff, including some material work and so forth that we're doing internally.

So I'm not going to start touting that right now. It's not the time to do that. But suffice it to say, we have some good, exciting stuff going on ourselves, and we have some product launch activity that's pretty exciting right in front of us.

Young Li
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

So I guess the follow-up question just on the fertility business. Can you maybe go a little bit more into detail on the assumptions for growth next year, talking about the geographic variances between U.S. and if it was a impact from consumer?

Albert White
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Sure. Yes, I mean, at the end of the day, it's going to be interesting to see what happens with fertility. I happen to believe that fertility by the end of the year will end up growing mid-single digits, and I think we'll grow a little bit faster than that. I think some of that's going to come because of the easier comps. Some of that's going to come because consumers just levels off in Asia Pac, where it's been weaker. Some of that's going to come because you have some pretty cool technology upgrades that are working their way through the system right now, including by us and you're going to see some fertility clinics upgrading.

Having said that, that is not what we factored into our guidance for this year. We factored in a more conservative expectation around fertility because I just don't want to get ahead of ourselves there. So when we look at it from a guidance perspective, it's kind of a market more in the low single digits and us growing more in the mid-single digits.

Next question comes from Navann Ty from BNP Paribas.

Navann Ty Dietschi
BNP Paribas, Research Division

On the MyDay momentum, can you discuss the revenue contribution of the MyDay product label contract in APAC throughout 2026 and 2027?

And then on fertility, could you provide more details on the recently improving cycles you have called out and any changes in competitive landscape between you, Vitrolife and Nexpring? And I don't know if you can give some details on the new technologies the clinics are interested in?

Albert White
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Sure. A number of things there. I'll answer your last one first because some of the new technology you may have just seen or if anyone follows it at ASRM, which is the big fertility conference here in the U.S. We just launched 3 new genomics tests that are being received incredibly well.

And we have some other technology advancements that we're going to be launching this year within our genomics space and also within our capital space. And then we've got some super exciting stuff that we're working on in our R&D side that I'm excited to get out in the coming years.

I'm going to step back to the MyDay momentum. I talked about that last quarter and that we were winning contracts, and we've been executing on those contracts. A lot of that was tied to Asia Pac. As I mentioned, we're now seeing contract wins in EMEA and in the U.S., and you're going to see that momentum build as we move into Q3 and Q4.

So that's a process that's going to happen. That's why I talk about the stairstep improvements because we have to manufacture the product, we have to label it and package it. We have to get it over into the hands of the retailer, the key account, whomever it is that's selling that product, and we have to get it launched. So it does take a little bit of time.

We clearly took a step forward here in Q4, and we're going to take a step forward again, and then we're going to take another step forward as we execute on those contracts. This is not the first time we've done it. I've seen this many times over the years here at CooperVision and it's going to happen again this time.

So I won't give you specific numbers on that, but I will just say that, as you win those contracts and as you execute on those contracts, just over the quarters, you start picking up energy on that, and we see that momentum right now picking up from a fitting activity, and that's the key.

The first step is get product in people's hands, get the fitting activity increasing and so forth, then it transfers over to the sales and you see that momentum building, and that's what we're seeing and that's what I'm referencing.

So I won't give you specific numbers on that, but hopefully, that gives you enough color to kind of get comfortable with it.

Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citi.

Unknown Analyst

This is Anthony on for Joanne. Could you just talk about your expectations for MiSight and the myopia management portfolio for fiscal '26?

Albert White
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

For MiSight for fiscal '26? Sure. We closed the year out well, right? We had a good solid quarter. I think we're going to have a good year next year. As I mentioned, I think we'll do at least 20%, 25% in fiscal '26.

There's a lot of reasons to believe that we're going to be stronger than that. But we also have the Stellest launch that's happening here in the U.S. So we're building a little conservatism in because of that. I mean right now, it's actually looking like it's a positive because you're just seeing so many people in the optical community talk about myopia control for children and how important it is and how it needs to be standard of care.

So in my mind, there's no question that long term, it's a significant positive and it's a significant positive for MiSight. If I look at just fiscal '26, could that impact our revenues here in the U.S. market a little bit? It could, right?

And if it does, we factored that in. That was our assumption, which is, if we get negatively impacted because of Stellest in the very short term, the growth on MiSight might come down towards the 20% range.

But there's a lot of reasons to be more optimistic. I mean MiSight launching in Japan that should be a great market. It's not until Q2, but that's come in MyDay, MiSight, as I mentioned, is arguably -- I'm going to argue the most innovative thing going on in the contact lens market, probably the most innovative thing by a wide margin going on in the contact lens market right now. That product launched in Europe, and we're going to hit a few other countries in Asia as we move through the year. So there's a lot of reasons to be excited about MiSight right now. We'll see how the year plays out.

Just had a couple of follow-ups on some of the CVI assumptions for FY '26. You were just talking about MiSight, but maybe just drilling into the Japan launch, which I think you mentioned today is planned for 2Q.

I was hoping you can maybe just touch on how you're thinking about the longer-term opportunity in that region. And then just coming back specifically to what's expected in the FY '26 guide as a result of that launch.

Albert White
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Sure. Well, let me just be clear because the launch is for MiSight in Japan. We have -- we obviously have MyDay there now, although to be fair, it's pretty new and a lot of the contracts are pretty new. So let me just bifurcate that quickly, right? Because I think that MiSight itself going into Japan for the very first time should be very successful. That's an ophthalmologist market, a product like that, that relies on clinical data, and that's the key when it comes to MiSight. I mean there's other things you could do, but MiSight is the only lens with this really strong clinical data. That will go over really well in a country like Japan.

So although it's a Q2 launch, it will gain traction as we move through the year, and I would envision that's going to be a really successful product towards the end of '26 and into '27.

If I think about Japan on a broader basis, we just didn't have the amount of MyDay capacity that we wanted there. We weren't able to do a number of the private label contracts and so forth that we wanted to because we didn't have product.

As you remember, Brett, right, we stopped being capacity constrained over the summer. We were able to aggressively go into all of Asia Pac, including Japan and start winning the private label contracts. We've won a number of those. We're executing on those now.

So the assumption is, not anything herculean, it's just that we execute under the contracts that we have and continue to get the product into the marketplace. So relatively straightforward stuff.

And that's one of the reasons that we put guidance, that 3.5% to 4.5% in Q1. We did a 3.2% this past quarter. We're not saying that we're going to get a hockey stick immediate ramp up. We're just saying we're going to continue to get consistent, solid, improving performance.

All right. And apologies if I misspoke, I meant to say MiSight. And then just circling back to one other question. You've talked about some of the distributor channel inventory dynamics in the Americas. I was hoping you could just update whether that had any impact on 4Q, either negative or if there was some positive reversion? And then if you're still assuming like a relatively neutral impact there for FY '26?

Albert White
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Sure. Yes, there was really nothing there. At the end of the day, from an inventory perspective, I didn't raise it because there was nothing to talk about.

Our next question comes from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.

David Roman
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I'll just ask 2 questions here quickly upfront. One is, can you give us just a little bit more detail on the nature of some of the reorganization efforts that you've undertaken here?

And then what are some of the actions you're taking to ensure retention? Sometimes with these restructurings, they're unintended consequences of losing the right people, you need to execute the business on a go-forward basis. What are you putting in place to ensure you have the right people to achieve the forward strategic objectives?

Albert White
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes, David, good question. On the reorg, it was pretty much across the board with a heavy focus on kind of back-office support. So we did look at all of our areas. CooperSurgical a little bit more so because we had some integration-related work and some sales force consolidation there. But there was a lot of leverage opportunity in our support function areas because of all the IT upgrades that we've done. And frankly, you hear people talk about AI all the time. Well, it is real. And when we looked at the AI that we've deployed, and our opportunities to leverage it, there were some good opportunities there.

When I look at retention details, I mean, we have fantastic people here, we have great teams of people who are here and the one thing that we're pushing on our organization right now is that we want everyone to embrace AI, continue to embrace it, continue to learn it, make AI your friend, so to speak. I mean because we made the moves that we needed to make in Q4 and our teams know that. And right now, it's about staying focused on executing, leveraging our growth, making all the appropriate moves.

But one of the things that we want to make sure we do here, we always try to do is, first and foremost, we promote from within. And that's just a key point. I mean if I gave you the stats, you would be amazed at how many promotions we have from within. And we're going to continue to do that. We train our people, and we want our people promoted from within.

We want everybody here being successful, making more money and get ahead because we're a growing organization. We just need to do it intelligently so that we can really truly leverage this revenue growth on a go-forward basis.

And the company right now is so much more efficient than it was and less bureaucratic that we're in a great spot right now to just do our jobs and execute.

Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Mizuho Group.

Maybe one on CVI, one on strategic review. Just CVI, maybe a little bit on the private label business, how that trended in the fiscal year where there are bigger opportunities out there that the gains or loss, how is that going to set up for '26 as well just thinking of the private label trend?

And then on strategic, maybe just to recap on historically, what are the synergies of having CSI and CVI under one umbrella. And then over the years, have you noticed any dissynergies? In other words, has capital allocation between those 2 businesses, has that been an issue that could be resolved if they were 2 separate entities?

Albert White
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Sure. On the private label trends, I would say -- I would probably point to the new private label contracts that we've won in the U.S. and in Europe. There's some exciting stuff there. I'm not going to go too far into it, but you'll see some of it because it will be hitting and making itself public in that -- in maybe even January, but February, March time frame. So I think that's going to set us up well for -- again, for Q3 and Q4 this year to be good quarters for us.

So I like the momentum that we have in Asia Pac in some different areas, but I'm probably equally excited about some of the newer contracts that we've won and that we'll be rolling out.

On the strategic synergies, I would say, from a capital perspective, we have always invested in CooperVision first and foremost. That's our main driver. We put our dollars there. You've seen that over the years in terms of new manufacturing lines and distribution center upgrades and IT upgrades and so forth.

We've also done a number of deals, as you know, at CooperSurgical as we built that business out. But the last one we did was over a year ago, we did a little tuck-in in August of last year. So it's been a little while there. We've got a great business there, right? Holly has pulled everything together and has a really much more efficient business today than it was a year or so ago.

And we -- because of that, we've been able to do that work and reallocate our capital, if you will, to share repurchases, and we're going to continue to focus in that area.

So I would say that there's been no negative at all from a capital allocation perspective. The synergies that we have are back-office synergies largely. And I talked about that and how we're just doing all that stuff more intelligently, but it's still back-office type synergies. Those businesses still, to a great degree, run separately.

That concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Al White for closing remarks.

Albert White
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Great. Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone. As you could tell, we had an incredible amount of work that was completed in this last quarter. And I'm excited that we were able to get on the phone with everyone today and go through those details and present it. And we look forward to speaking with everyone over the coming weeks. Thank you. Thank you for your time.
