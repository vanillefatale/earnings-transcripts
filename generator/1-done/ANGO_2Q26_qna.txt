Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Frank Takkinen with Lake Street Capital.

Frank Takkinen

Jim, congratulations on the retirement. Wishing you all the best in that new chapter. I was hoping to start with a question around gross margin. It feels like that really outperformed nicely in the quarter, and obviously saw the guidance stay unchanged. And I think I heard a comment around staying relatively stable, which would imply gross margin actually doing a little bit better than where the consensus is at right now for the year? Any comments around kind of gross margin expectations and why we shouldn't see that kind of mid-50% gross margin stay throughout the end of the year and into the following years?

Stephen Trowbridge
Executive VP & CFO

Frank, this is Steve. I'll take the gross margin question. So you're right. We were very pleased with the performance that we've seen on gross margin, particularly in the first half. And as we mentioned, there's a couple of dynamics that are driving that. We're seeing positive price in both our Med Tech and our Med Device businesses. And we're seeing a benefit of the production related to us getting ready to do is the move of some of those materials down to Costa Rica. So increased price along with the mix shift to Med Tech and then some of those production volumes are what we're seeing as a nice positive for gross margin in the first half.

In the back half of the year, the price that we took is still going to continue to stay there. That mix shift will continue, but we're going to have a little bit of a structural underabsorption as we move some of those final products out of Queensbury and having them being produced by our third-party manufacturing partner down in Costa Rica. As we talked about this plan originally, we knew that there was going to be some of that structural underabsorption. And we had mentioned that, that would be somewhat offset by taking costs out, and that has been the overall plan as we take some costs out of indirect labor. The good thing that our team has done is we've accelerated some of those costs coming out of the plant. So you're seeing that in the first half of the year.

So really, the dynamic going into the second half is some of those products now finalizing their move according with our plans, you'll see some of that structural underabsorption. You won't have the offsetting cost cuts, but that's because those costs have already come out. So that's really the dynamic and the difference between the first and the second half.

Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just for my second one, I was hoping to talk a little bit more about mechanical thrombectomy. I heard the comments around AngioVac had a more challenging year-over-year comp, but I was curious if there's anything else going on in that business. We were hoping it would be a little bit stronger growth, but I understand it was off a pretty tough comp. And then maybe as a second part to that, if you could talk about kind of ApexReturn and some of the other work in right heart and what that might do to the growth profile of that line item over time?

James Clemmer
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Frank, thanks for the question. Really, really pleased with the performance of AlphaVac and PE as we're gaining new cases, new doctors and getting awarded kind of status in the hospital through VAC committees, getting "on the shelf in inventory". In new accounts, the performance of AlphaVac is terrific. We see pictures every day, hear stories of new physicians using it because of the unique design elements that we innovatively put into the product. So really excited about that continued growth at a strong level for a long time to come. AngioVac will be fine.

If you look back a year ago, we had a really strong Q2, and revenue went down in Q3 and back in Q4. There are cycles that just happen sometimes. So we're pleased. And you saw, I think we're up 11% in AngioVac in the first 6 months of the year. So we're really pleased with the platform. It will be one of our key growth categories for a long time to come. We have 2 amazing products that work really well in that place and it will drive growth. And then Steve, as far as...

Stephen Trowbridge
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And then, Frank, to follow up on the question on AlphaReturn. As we've always said, we've got the best product on the market. We're very confident in that. We think when we take the AlphaVac product, we get that into the hands of physicians, consistently, the feedback that we're getting is that it gives them what they need and it's the best product that is out there.

As we've talked about, a hurdle to adoption in some areas because of the way that the market has been conditioned has been the ability to then return the blood. AlphaVac is designed upfront to limit blood loss and mitigate that. But there's no doubt that the market is looking for an opportunity to return that blood in certain scenarios. And so we think that the AlphaReturn product is really important for us to get over some of those initial humps to have people choose AlphaVac if maybe in the past, they've been used to using competitive products.

So we're really excited about it. We've talked about the conversations we've been having FDA for a while. We are very pleased to get this over the finish line. We're excited about the IDE study starting it and then getting this into the bag of our sales force really as a way to take away an objection, and we expect it to be a catalyst to accelerating growth in the future.

The next questions are from the line of Bill Plovanic with Canaccord Genuity.

William Plovanic
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

Just first, Jim, congratulations. I know 10 years is a long time, and it's a lot of work that you've accomplished and some great outcomes. So my hats off to you and you'll definitely be missed. In terms of my questions are, I want to start with prostate. I know you're only a few days in. Just talk about the change to the Level 1 CPT code. How many insurers have really made that back-end change to reflect the coding change to prevent the automatic denials so far by your estimation?

And then I noticed that the capital was a really strong quarter. I mean disposables were good. They saw a very strong, but it seems like capital was even stronger. And I'm curious, is that a precursor to the prostate is they're buying the systems to get ready to do procedures?

Stephen Trowbridge
Executive VP & CFO

Bill, thanks for the question. This is Steve. And we want to congratulate Jim too, although he's not going anywhere right away. So he's going to be with us for a while. So we're happy about that, and there will be time to talk about everything that he's done. On your question on prostate, we're just a few days into it, so we don't have an estimate for the changes that you were talking about, but it's something that our team is absolutely keyed in on, and we're going to continue to watch and monitor. We think that this is going to be a catalyst for us, particularly on the Medicare side. So it's something that we're going to stay close to and watch. But we're pleased now with over the last year, I've been talking about the code going into effect. So the turn of the calendar was a good move for us, and we're excited about that.

On capital, there's 2 dynamics. Capital was strong. There was also the capital sales that we talked about in the distribution channel move in France that added some additional NanoKnife capital. But on top of that, we were still pretty pleased with the capital sales that we saw. So as we've mentioned, capital sales are mostly going to be in the international markets. Here in the U.S., it's going to be a mixture of different models to make sure that we get capital into the hands of our physicians that could be through placement models, that could be through sales.

I think the arbiter that we're looking at are those probe sales. And so we were really pleased with the nice increase in probe sales. And it's all coming from increased awareness and enthusiasm on the part of urologists. And it's really a prostate that's driving the NanoKnife results that we've seen so far.

And then just on EBITDA, you mentioned that the back half would be, I think, lower than the first half. And -- just directionally, how do we think of adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter? Is it going to be negative?

Stephen Trowbridge
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Bill. So on EBITDA, we just wanted to make sure we were very pleased with the performance that we've seen here in the first half in EBITDA. We think it does prove out that the model is and can generate positive EBITDA, can generate cash as well as driving the top line. So we're excited to keep that continuing. We've also talked about wanting to balance that with investments that are necessary to continue to drive the top line growth in those Med Tech businesses. And so we've talked about investments into feet on the street in terms of the sales force as well as some of those R&D investments that Jim mentioned with his prepared remarks today for some of the nice trials that are coming up.

So some of that's going to come into the back half. We don't expect negative in the third quarter. Maybe just not as robust as what we saw in the first half.

The next question is from the line of Eduardo Martinez with H.C. Wainwright.

Eduardo Martinez-Montes
H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. I had a few questions on Auryon. You mentioned the CE Mark, and I'm just curious what your expectations are for international sales, if there are any specific regions you guys are going to target. And if that would be associated with any increased sales spend? And also if you could quantify the opportunity there and your expectations for this year?

James Clemmer
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Eduardo. Good question. We're really pleased the fact that our team got the CE Mark for Auryon. And then our commercial and clinical teams have really done a great job driving awareness outside of the U.S. Atherectomy isn't chosen at the same rate outside the U.S. to treat PAD as it is here. But we've used a series of clinical forms and educational programs that our team has driven outside of the U.S. to really give people confidence in Auryon as a platform, how the science works. And it's important for us because once people see how the science works, how safe and effective the product is in treating that artery, above or below the need, flexible and safe. So it doesn't take a lot of hands-on user training by us. So we're able to use our really good distributor network to support growth, support customers during the use of the product.

So we've not identified or targeted yet a size of the market that we think we'll capture, but we're really pleased with the uptake already in people getting new Auryon systems, buying the disposables, treating patients with PAD and having really good results. So over time, you'll see our international sales creep up as a larger percentage of our overall sales.

Eduardo Martinez-Montes
H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division

Got it. That's really helpful. And also on Auryon, you mentioned expansion into coronary applications. I'm just curious if you had a time line for that? And also any increased spend, if that's something we can expect in the R&D line item this year in 2026?

Stephen Trowbridge
Executive VP & CFO

I wouldn't expect a significant amount of spend in the R&D line item this year as we talk about coronary. Clearly, it's a strategic imperative of ours to take the product and move into the coronary space. It's a little bit of a longer-term initiative. As we talked about, it's probably a PMA trial. So we gave some highlights in the past of the ability to take our current platform technologies and through clinical and regulatory pathway expansion, move into additional TAMs. A very good example of that is Auryon moving into the coronary space, but it's not something that's going to be impactful in terms of the spend in this year.

At this time, I'll hand the call back to Mr. Jim Clemmer for closing remarks.

James Clemmer
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Rob. Rob, I'd like to thank all of our employees here at AngioDynamics, who've made these great results possible by their commitment and dedication to our customer and our products. So we've changed this company by its portfolio. You've seen us become active portfolio managers to make sure our company is positioned in the right places at the right time with the right products for future growth. The company is doing a really good job executing today, but we're also building for tomorrow and investing in opportunities to expand the application of our products geographically and in new clinical applications. So we're really pleased with where the company is headed. We can't wait to share more results with you in the future. Thanks to all of our teammates.
