Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions] First question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI.

David Raso
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I was just curious, can you walk us through the margin improvement you expect from 4Q to 1Q despite the flat deliveries?

R. Feight
CEO & Director

4Q to 1Q, the thinking is, David, is a lot to unpack there, but one of thing you look at in fourth quarter is we had the 232 going into effect. Obviously, that went into effect November 1, say, the month, we had higher tariffs. So that happened in there. The other thing that wasn't significant is our manufacturing teams in the fourth quarter did a really great job of being able to convert the factories over to build trucks local for local. So for example, Chillicothe and Denton are now building the medium-duty trucks. And in Canada, we're able to build all of the product lines, principally for Canada.

So that's a lot of adjustment in schedules during the fourth quarter, which had some impact on margins, and as we look forward, we get a full quarter in quarter 1 of margins that are benefiting from the 232 tariff. There's the clarity of NOx 27, which happens. So I think that's starting to have some improvement.

Order intake has been very good, very strong in December and through January. So we're seeing some uptick in terms of customer demand, which is good for our business as well. And that's what's driving up the margin 12.5% to 13% in Q1 compared to the 12% in Q4.

David Raso
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And that last point about orders, I would have thought maybe the build sequentially could be up. What's the translation from those orders into when you expect to produce those trucks?

R. Feight
CEO & Director

Yes. I mean, I think you know the cadence of it is a lot of orders at the end of the year come in as fleets that are spread delivery throughout the year. So that's a little bit of what I think everybody saw in the fourth quarter. And then what we're seeing now is a little bit more close in terms of order intake, but it's allowing us to build up our backlog a little bit, increased visibility a little bit. And then that's what's going to translate into higher build in the outer quarters.

David Raso
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And lastly, to quantify a little bit 4Q to 1Q. Can you give us some sense of the price/cost dynamic in truck in the fourth quarter, and maybe how to frame it with the Section 232 benefits for 1Q?

R. Feight
CEO & Director

Yes, I think you can see favorability coming in Q1 compared to Q4 in price cost, most significantly is cost reductions that we would expect to see. And again, doing that comparison of the work our factories did, that has some cost impact in the fourth quarter in terms of getting the right trucks in the right places. And then again, we get the benefit of 232 in Q1. So it gets a lot more stable in that for a net positive price cost on truck. Brice, you had something.

Brice Poplawski
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, we also had a higher level of overtime in the fourth quarter because of the events that Preston spoke to. And getting all the trucks out at the end of the year, our employees did a fantastic job getting all the trucks out that our customers so desperately want to have. So we felt really good about that. That should not be recurring in the first quarter either.

Operator

We now turn to Jerry Revich with Wells Fargo.

Jerry Revich
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Kevin, congratulations. I'm wondering if you could just talk about what you're seeing in the performance of your aftermarket business in January by region. It feels like there's an uptick in Europe, in particular, that's playing out. But I'm wondering if you could just provide the context you just provided on orders for aftermarket Europe and U.S., please?

Kevin Baney
President

Yes. Sure, Jerry. So forecast for Q1 is 3% growth year-over-year. Team did a great job, let's say, in a soft parts market with record sales growth for last year and definitely for the fourth quarter. And what we are seeing is a soft part market customers, really are focused on required maintenance. And so we saw a mix shift towards that. We've got great AI agentic tools to help identify that and not only get that mix shift in our distribution centers, but also out with the dealers. And so we've got a forecast of 4% to 8% growth for this year. And we'll see that definitely, as we see the truck side accelerate through the year, we'll see that on the parts side as well.

Jerry Revich
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Super. And then in Europe, specifically.

Kevin Baney
President

Yes, split in -- yes, that's what I was about to say. And then just the split in region is, I think, it will be consistent in North America as well as Europe.

Jerry Revich
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Very interesting. And then can we just double click on Europe a little bit. So production was really high in the quarter versus normal seasonality and you took up your outlook for Europe. Can you just expand on what you're seeing in terms of -- is it a particular set of countries that are driving the demand acceleration for you folks in Europe? Or how broad is the activity improvement?

R. Feight
CEO & Director

Yes. The market finished at -- I'll focus on heavy duty at 297,000 and so relatively strong market for Europe. No specific focus on any given region. Obviously, depending on where you are in Europe, some markets are stronger than others. We continue to focus on premium trucks. Preston said, we are recognized as Fleet Truck of the Year in the U.K., International Truck of the Year for the DOF XF and XD, and so we just -- we took the market up because we see similar strong market this year as well.

Jerry Revich
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Good summary. And lastly, can I ask on Section 232 as that starts to impact your competitors, how are you thinking about market share versus unit profitability from a PACCAR standpoint, as we look back historically, you folks have targeted improving unit profitability cycle over cycle. And so as we're thinking about the benefits from the rebate program as well as chatter out there for $9,000 type price increases. Can you just provide a PACCAR perspective on where you see unit profitability going and how you folks are thinking about market share versus profitability given Section 232 even is the playing field for you folks?

R. Feight
CEO & Director

Yes. I think the last statement you made is really instructive because throughout 2025, there was a bit of a disadvantage. And now I think we anticipate that to be an advantage. It doesn't come through quickly, right? It's a competitive world out there. So in the first quarter, many of our competitors haven't taken that to the market, those tariff cuts to the market yet, which keeps things in a bit of a very competitive state, maintains that dynamic nature we were talking about in our commentary, but through the year, we feel good about our opportunity to gain in terms of margin and market share as the year progresses and things stabilize out. Because it does seem stable now, and because our teams have done such a good job getting the local-for-local manufacturing, there really should be an opportunity for us in both categories.

Operator

We now turn to Robert Wertheimer with Melius Research.

Robert Wertheimer
Melius Research LLC

I'm so sorry. Just following up on Jerry's, the cycle margins and where your kind of competitive and production position sits in North America now versus in the past? Is there any reason to think as things normalize over the next year or 2 or 3 that your truck margins should be anything different from average, whether higher or lower? And I have one follow-up.

R. Feight
CEO & Director

I would say, Rob, that predicting out 1, 2, 3 years in the operating environment we're in is a little bit challenging in terms of what things are going to look like. There's a USMCA negotiation that's going to take place probably later this year, so it will be instructive to look at that. So I think that could have an impact on how margins feel.

What I think we're focused on is making sure that the trucks we're providing have the greatest value to our customers. And to that end, as you know, right, we have the newest lineup of trucks out there, and one of the things that we're now focusing on is how we're going to be able to help our customers be more profitable through the use of the Agentic AI that Kevin mentioned, but also maybe more generally in connected truck data.

So our ability to have connected every truck be connected and gather like petabytes of data from our trucks and then use that data to provide customer value is significant in the coming years. So that's what we can control, and that's where our focus is, because high-quality trucks, lowest cost of ownership, highest reliability and new transportation solutions for our customers would help them be more successful.

Robert Wertheimer
Melius Research LLC

Interesting. I look forward to hear more about that. And then just a quick one. Did you mention your European market share for the year?

Kevin Baney
President

Yes. I hadn't yet, Rob, but it was 13.5% on the heavy-duty side.

Robert Wertheimer
Melius Research LLC

Perfect. I'll have a bunch of questions for you shortly, and thank you very much.

Operator

We now turn to Steven Fisher with UBS.

Steven Fisher
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Just wanted to confirm some of the production dynamics in the quarter, the 15,000 in U.S. and Canada, I thought I heard you say that maybe that was affected by sort of shifting local for local. How much of -- I guess, was the 15,000 less than what you expected. How did that compare? How much of that, if you could break it out, was tied to sort of shifting that production plans around? Or was there anything else going on in the quarter?

R. Feight
CEO & Director

Yes, I think it's not what we expected.

Steven Fisher
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Can you hear me?

R. Feight
CEO & Director

Yes, we can. Can you hear us?

Steven Fisher
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. Yes, sure.

R. Feight
CEO & Director

Yes. So that 15,000 is kind of right where we thought it would be right in the range of where we thought it would be. Europe probably delivered a few more, maybe North America, a little less. But what we really saw is a cadence change through the quarter and a cadence change continuing through the first quarter of stronger order intake, the ability for the truck plans, as we mentioned -- team mentioned, because I'm so proud of them, but for them to be able to keep the build going while they were doing this transition to build was really impressive.

So if there was anything, a few hundred units might have been varied in there where they were working through bringing in trucks out of Mexico, bringing in trucks out of Canada and bringing that flexibility and then the team in Canada flexing into a wide variety of model mixes built in Sainte. There are some inefficiencies in that, but their ability to manage that was significant and really impressive. And so I don't think we're too surprised at all by it. What we feel good about is the stability we have going forward and how that's going to be helpful to the build cadence through the 2026 calendar year.

Steven Fisher
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess translating that into then the first quarter flat, can you just give us sort of the regional color there directionally for U.S. and -- U.S., Canada versus Europe?

R. Feight
CEO & Director

Yes. We see U.S., Canada up some and then Europe down a little bit as the higher deliveries in the fourth quarter at year-end in Europe.

Operator

We now turn to Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley.

Angel Castillo Malpica
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just wanted to unpack a little bit more on the order uptick. You noted the continuation of maybe some of that into January. We saw a strong December order data. So could you just expand on maybe the shape of the strength in January? And just maybe any details on what percentage of your order book or order slots are now filled for kind of 1Q and 2Q.

And then maybe just related to that, like if you could expand on just the areas where you're seeing the uptick in orders, is there any kind of particular pockets, whether it's vocational or is it more related to EPA prebuy? Like what are you hearing in terms of the strength in those orders?

R. Feight
CEO & Director

Yes. I think as you articulated the numbers for December, you know those order intakes, I'd say January continued in that same level of cadence of significant overbuild rate order intake. Some spread delivery there as you talked about fleets that are kind of putting in their buying decisions, but also some things that are closer in, as you mentioned, vocational, and we're seeing some significant orders from bodybuilders coming into our mix now so they can replenish their inventory for 2026 and then a steadiness in the LTL market. So it's kind of a mixture. You articulated that well, and that's what we see.

So strong order intake kind of across the board, which is helping us grow those backlogs, which is going to be positive for the year. And then I would say, I may add is in Q1 were mostly full. And then as you know, we'll look at Q2 as we get to the next earnings call.

Angel Castillo Malpica
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

That's very helpful. And then maybe just along those lines, on the North America truck outlook for the year, I guess, U.S. and Canada, can you just expand a little bit. So you raised Europe and South America, but it sounds like the level of orders here is pretty robust, but you got the North America unit outlook unchanged. How should we read that? Is there any nuances to what you're seeing maybe whether it's market share shifts or that this positions you may be better for -- or the industry better for the top end of the range we have provided. How should we kind of take that into context, given the unchanged guides for the industry?

R. Feight
CEO & Director

Well, I think the truth is, our unchanged is higher than maybe like ACT was previously. So we feel -- we felt good about 2026. We still feel good about 2026. And so there's really no change from our positive sense of what's going to come through the year and the fact that it's going to be a year of acceleration for us, and acceleration sequentially is what we'd expect to see through the year.

Operator

Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.

Scott Group
Wolfe Research, LLC

So when truck rates start moving higher, we tend to see more truck orders. It feels like some of the reason why truck rates are going higher right now is that there's fewer drivers and the government is focused on nondomicile and things like that. If this is more of a supply-driven cycle with fewer drivers, how do you think about what that means for truck orders and this cycle going forward?

R. Feight
CEO & Director

Yes. I think it's a great point, Scott. And you -- obviously, you're dialed in on what's going on there, but if there are fewer drivers that maybe aren't meeting the legal requirements, those drivers probably are working on the lower side of the contract rates and the spot rate businesses. And then what you see is those more established carriers tend to have probably somewhat higher rates. The fact that there's fewer that low side drivers enables them to probably command a better rate positioning. I think there's some of that going on right now. Obviously, as they get better rate positioning, their profitability will hopefully improve and then that will drive their ability to have better cash flow and purchase more trucks.

Scott Group
Wolfe Research, LLC

And then a similar question. When you -- this order pick up, do you have a sense, is this more replacement? Or is there any growth? And if it is sort of more replacement, I don't know, just thoughts on how you see the used truck market evolving over the course of the year.

R. Feight
CEO & Director

Yes. I think in the used truck space, it's kind of an interesting kind of read through to me is, we think that as the year goes on, used trucks should become more valuable, simply because of things are shaping out in the marketplace, even into next year. So it should be positive right now. There's been a little bit of a downtick in used trucks because some of those buyers might be the people that are being affected by the CDL enforcement rules. And those might have been the buyers for the used truck. So there's a temporary moment there.

And also, I think we've still seen the finishing up of rationalization of fleets that we're going to be in the business and make it through this cycle versus those that are leaving the business. So all of that kind of put in, you would expect to see the number of delinquencies diminish as the year progresses as fleet profitability has come up and then use truck pricing follow that.

Scott Group
Wolfe Research, LLC

And just so I understand your point about use being more valuable. Is that a sort of comment around EPA27 and big increases in new truck prices coming next year?

R. Feight
CEO & Director

Exactly. Yes, that's part of the same part of it.

Kevin Baney
President

Yes. We saw a 4% increase in used truck values year-over-year, and we expect that to continue to increase for that reason.

Operator

We now turn to Chad Dillard with Bernstein.

Charles Albert Dillard
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

I want to spend some time on Parts' gross margin. So first of all, fourth quarter, what was it? And then how do you think about that scaling in '266 as that business reaccelerates?

Kevin Baney
President

Yes, Chad, this is Kevin. So fourth quarter was 29.5%. And as I mentioned, in a soft parts market, I'd say that's -- it's pretty good results. And again, team is doing a great job providing excellent customer service, getting right parts at the right place, right time. And so in a soft parts market, customers are really focused on required maintenance. And so we were able to address that shift, and what we're forecasting going forward is kind of a rebalancing of that mix as the market improves and a higher take on proprietary parts.

Charles Albert Dillard
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then just really quickly on inventories. Can you just give us an update on where PACCAR is versus the market? And then just in terms of truck pricing, how are you thinking about that evolving as you go through '26?

R. Feight
CEO & Director

Sure. If we look at the industry inventory, I think the industry inventory for Class 8 is 3.2 months and PACCAR is at 2.2 months. So we feel like we're in an optimal spot on our inventory positioning. And that at least for us, we would expect build registrations to be fairly aligned this year. So that gives us a good opportunity as well. And we're starting to see that, like we're starting to see dealers come in with stock orders. And as we mentioned previously, body builders want to have their spots put in. So that's the way we see inventory and its relationship to our build.

Operator

Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Truist.

Jamie Cook
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Nice quarter. I guess, my first question, understanding your retail sales forecast for North America, and now that we have more clarity on EPA 2027. Obviously, markets appear better versus where we were. But Preston, to what degree are you concerned the supply chain can't ramp if things really do improve? And where would those bottlenecks be? And how are you handling that? And then my second question, which is my guess is you won't answer, but I'm going to try, the revenues were better, deliveries were better, your gross margins were in line with your forecast, but you said it was hurt by your shift in manufacturing local for local. Is there any way you'll quantify what that impact was in the fourth quarter?

R. Feight
CEO & Director

Yes. So your second question, you're right. You understand it. It was significant. I'm not going to give you a number because there's a lot of gray in that number. So I'd be taking a number that has multiple inputs to it. Say that it was a significant impact to us, and it is one that we don't expect to carry forward as we look into the future quarters. from a bottlenecks of supplier standpoint? And does that have an impact on the year. I feel like that's something that our customers are going to need to think about. We have great relationships with our suppliers.

We've given them our forecast, and we've given them that cadence of sequential growth and acceleration through the year and our expectations of our build. So they're aware of it. That helps them, right? So having a good plan helps them. But it does mean that if we get into a third, fourth quarter, where build is significantly higher than it puts stress on their systems as well. And we've been through the cycle, you just articulated it. There comes a point where if the ramp is too significant, it becomes bounded. We don't see that yet, but we don't rule out that, that could happen in the second half of the year as well. And if that's what happens, then that's typically when price accelerates.

Operator

Our next question comes from Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies.

Stephen Volkmann
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I wanted to stick with the 27 NOx thing. Have you guys communicated to your customers, and maybe even if you're willing to, to us, what the price increase associated with that will be?

R. Feight
CEO & Director

We've talked in generalities. And the reason we speak to generalities, just because I think the EPA has done a very good job of trying to let people know there would be 35 milligrams, but they also have stated that they're looking at useful life and warranty and what those impacts would be on cost. So those could still be subject to change.

In general, I think the best number is to use like a plus or minus on $10,000. That's what we've been talking to customers about. It gives them a range to think about. so they can kind of plan in with a new technology and a $10,000 increase does it mean they want to shift their buying pattern around?

Stephen Volkmann
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. That's helpful. And then this is -- almost coming back to Jamie's question. But -- so presumably, there'll be some sort of a prebuy as we get toward the end of the year. I think you guys have been in that camp for a while now. But if the demand were stronger, would you be willing to flex up to meet it? Or does the fact that 27 probably sort of comes back down fairly quickly post the change mean that it's sort of your appetite for building a lot in the second half is more limited?

R. Feight
CEO & Director

We serve our customers. And so if our customers are asking us for trucks, we do everything in our power to get them trucks.

Operator

We now turn to Kyle Menges with Citi.

Kyle Menges
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I wanted to follow up on the last question. I guess, more -- not as much on the customer side, but just from the standpoint of the potential of dealers stocking up, you may be willing to carry a little bit more inventory in the 2027. You made a comment that you're seeing dealers ordering stock trucks right now. So it would be helpful to just hear about how you're thinking of the potential for dealer stocking, and I guess, risk of an inventory overhang exiting 2026?

R. Feight
CEO & Director

Well, I mean, I think the statement of an inventory overhang has a negative connotation to it to me. And I'm not sure that if they had inventory going into 2027, that would be necessarily too big of a problem. I think that it's a little early to predict what the fourth quarter is going to look like because as I said, we have to see what the rules end up being from the EPA. I do think there will be an acceleration through the year. That seems obviously starting to happen to me. How big that is and how significant it is at the year-end, I think that's a lot of speculation that we can't really get to yet.

Kyle Menges
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then just on the Parts guidance, the 4% to 8% and starting the first quarter at plus 3%, just, how much visibility do you have to that ramp going from 3 to, I guess, plus 7% or 8% as we move throughout 2026? And just what are the key drivers of that acceleration in growth?

Kevin Baney
President

Kyle, the key drivers are just the anticipated demand as we go through the year with the market. We've had, if you look at last year, it was a relatively soft market throughout the year. And so just with customers accelerating, putting trucks back into service. We just were anticipating kind of a steady growth as we go through the year.

R. Feight
CEO & Director

The other thing to maybe think of as tariffs should be a favorability in the parts side just like there on the truck side as you look at the year.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We now turn to Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan.

Tami Zakaria
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

First question is on the tariff-related surcharges or price increases you talked about last year. Are you rolling back some of those price increases or surcharges given that Section 232 eases some of the tariff cost burdens for you now?

R. Feight
CEO & Director

Yes. Tami, we are. We've got rid of tariff surcharges for 2026. So they sit in there in terms of what our actuals are because remember, IEPA is still sitting out there as a tariff cost for everyone that needs to be clarified still, but we are seeing some price slide in Q1 expectation, but more than offset by cost. So that gives us a positive in price cost.

Tami Zakaria
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Understood. That's super helpful. And as a follow-up, I wanted to understand the first quarter gross margin guide a little better. Did you see at any point in the fourth quarter the gross margin rate being in that 12.5% to 13% range, meaning, is it fair to assume that you exited 4Q at a 12.5% to 13% range, and that's what you're expecting for the full quarter in the first quarter, given deliveries would be similar.

R. Feight
CEO & Director

Yes. I think what you're insinuating is are we seeing sequential improvement in margin by month, and we don't break it out that way, but in general, yes, we're seeing improvement in margin as we go sequentially even within quarters.

Operator

Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners.

Jeffrey Kauffman
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Congratulations. I just wanted to think a little bit about -- I just wanted to think a little bit about margin opportunity or market share opportunity in 2026. We've been speaking with some trucking companies that have said even now, they still can't really put in orders for freightliners or internationals because post the 232 tariffs, they're not really certain what those prices are. So you talked about the shift post 232 and how that's an advantage for you.

What are your customers telling you about their ability to those that have, say, more than one nameplate, more than just Kenworth and Peterbilt on their fleet, because we've seen the uptick in truck purchasing. And to your point, that could be a combination of, okay, we got EPA clarity, we got 232 clarity on our domestic produced trucks, but our understanding is, your customers are still having trouble putting in orders for their non-U.S.-built trucks post 232. So could there be a bigger opportunity for market share for you? And then when will you get some more certainty on that?

R. Feight
CEO & Director

Yes. I think you must be talking to the same people we're talking to, because I think they would like to have that clarity as well in terms of what pricing is going to be from some of our competitors, and that will certainly find its way into the market in the coming months. We've been able to give them clarity from our standpoint, I think it's helpful. And so we feel like we should be able to meet their demand when they're ready to make those decisions, which should be good for us through the year, both, I think, from a market share standpoint and a margin standpoint.

Jeffrey Kauffman
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

So just to follow up on that. The increased confidence you're seeing with their customers, and I know ACT Research just put the pre-buy back into their numbers. How much of this do you feel is increased confidence in the environment versus maybe just increased clarity on what's going on with EPA?

R. Feight
CEO & Director

Yes, I think it's both. I think that the clarity is helpful, but without the confidence in the freight markets without the rate increases and without increased profitability for the carriers, the 40% of the truckload carriers being in the market, they need those things in order to be more than just tariff and regulatory clarity.

So I do think it's a both thing. And I think that's where we're at the point where we have tariff clarity. We have regulatory clarity happening, but I think we're just in the beginning parts of having the truckload carrier profitability return. So that has to continue to evolve, which will be positive for the year when that happens.

Operator

And our final question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America.

Michael Feniger
BofA Securities, Research Division

You guys touched on the price versus cost trending more favorably in Q1 versus Q4, it's mostly on the cost side, you commented on pricing is a little soft in Q1. You pointed out how competitors have not fully taken into tariff cost to market. We're hearing commentary out there on discounts. How do you see pricing in Q1 to beyond Q1 kind of playing out through the year as we start to get closer to that prebuy?

R. Feight
CEO & Director

I think that's what's going to be telling is once there's price clarity from everybody in the market and the tariffs are affected into things, it's going to be -- and there will be some costs that come along, and I think that's where price will start to become a favorable factor through the year.

Michael Feniger
BofA Securities, Research Division

All right. And when we think, is there a rule of thumb we should think about your cost of goods sold? How much is raw materials, what we should be watching, what the lag is there?

Brice Poplawski
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. This is Brice. Our -- the material in our product is the vast majority. It's 80%, 85%. So labor and overhead are the remainder. So it materials mean a lot in our pricing.

Michael Feniger
BofA Securities, Research Division

Fair enough. And look, you guys have an Analyst Day in a few weeks. I remember at the 2022 Investor Day, there was just a lot of focus from investors if PACCAR can drive higher margin cycle over cycle, and you clearly delivered that in 2023 with strong profitability. Now as we're coming off this Investor Day in a few weeks, early innings of this -- we're hoping the new truck cycle, do you think we can see higher cycle-over-cycle profitability that continue? What are some of the factors we should be thinking about as we're assessing the profitability as we're moving to this next recovering truck cycle?

R. Feight
CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks for the commentary first of all, and then the question because the commentary is great. I think it's absolutely objectively true, cycle-over-cycle performance that teams have delivered is really significant and outstanding. We'll share more of that in the Investor Day. And then as we look to the future, we feel great about the opportunities in front of us. It's not just trucks and it's not just parts, it's not just financial services, but we think there's other new opportunities coming towards us in terms of how we support our customers with advanced transportation solutions, data, connectivity and the interplay of all of those. So those are all positive for the business looking forward. So we feel great about not just this year but the future and look forward to seeing many of you in Denton.
