Utilization rate in the fourth quarter is stayed the same as the previous one, around 78%. For the sequential comparison, revenue grow 4.5% quarter-over-quarter to TWD 61.8 billion. Gross margin improved to over 30% to now 30.7% or gross margin of TWD 18.95 billion.

And the non-operating income remained similar to that of last quarter. And the net income overall contributed to shareholder of the parent is around TWD 10.05 billion or EPS of TWD 0.81 in Q4 of 2025.

For year-over-year comparison, on Page 6, revenue grew by 2.3% to reach TWD 237.5 billion for the whole year of 2025. Gross margin rate is around 29% or TWD 68.9 billion. And for the net income attributable to the shareholder of the parent for year 2025, is around TWD 41.7 billion or 17.6% net income rate. EPS for 2025 was TWD 3.34, which is a decline compared to that of TWD 3.8 in 2024.

On Page 7, our balance sheet at the end of 2025. Cash amounts still more than TWD 110 billion, with total equity of the company is now TWD 379.8 billion at the end of 2025.

For ASP on Page 8, you can tell for the last three quarters or four quarters, it pretty much remained similar level for our blended ASP for throughout the 2025.

For revenue breakdown on Page 9. For quarterly comparison, the change is mainly showing in the increase in Asia and Europe with now North America represents about 21% in Q4 of last year.

For the full year breakdown on Page 10, the change is similar. We see North America dropped from 25% in 2024 to 22% in 2025.

For Page 11, IDM for Q4 revenue still represent about 20%, almost no change. But for the full year number on Page 12, IDM account for 19%, increased by 3 percentage points to 19% in 2025.

For quarterly revenue breakdown by application, it remains almost similar quarter-over-quarter on Page 13.

For the annual performance on the application breakdown on Page 4 (sic) [ Page 14 ] consumer increased by 3 percentage points to 31% from 28% in the previous year. And we continue to see 22-nanometer to be our key driver of growth for the recent quarters and also forward-looking as well. So 22 and 28 nanometers revenue in Q4 '25 now represent 36% of the total revenue pool.

On Page 16. For the full year, the increase of 22 and 28 nanometers revenue is 3 percentage points, and we also show about 2 percentage point increase in 14-nanometer on a year-over-year comparison.

Capacity remained flat on a quarter-over-quarter comparison base, but it will decline by roughly 1% due to the annual maintenance schedule.

On Page 18, our latest forecast for 2026 CapEx plan is around USD 1.5 billion, which is slightly declined from USD 1.6 billion in the year of 2025. The above is a summary of UMC's results for Q4 2025. More details are available in the report, which has been posted on our website.

I will now turn the call over to President of UMC, Mr. Jason Wang.

Jason Wang
Co-President & Representative Director

Thank you, Chi-Tung. Good evening, everyone. Here, I would like to share UMC's fourth quarter results. In the fourth quarter, our results were in line with the guidance with a flattish wafer shipments amid mild demand across most of the markets. The 4.5% revenue increase during the quarter was supported by favorable foreign exchange movements as well as a sequential growth in our 22- and 28-nanometer business, which continues to improve our product mix. With the 22- and 28-nanometer segment, 22-nanometer's revenue increased 31% quarter-on-quarter to a record high, accounting for more than 13% of total fourth quarter revenue.

Looking at the full year, UMC delivered solid performance in 2025 with shipment increasing 12.3% and revenue in U.S. dollar up 5.3% year-on-year. Going into the first quarter of 2026, we expect wafer demand to remain firm. UMC is confident that 2026 will be another growth year as a tape-out on our 22-nanometer platform accelerate, and other new solutions continue to gain business traction.

We have been working hard to lay the foundation for our next phase of growth, investing for the future in both capacity and technology. In 2025, we completed the new Phase III facility at our Singapore Fab 12i, which is already playing a central role in supporting customers to diversify supply chain.

At the same time, we are striving to expand our footprint in the U.S. through an innovative yet cost-effective modes of partnership, such as our 12-nanometer collaboration with Intel and the recently announced MoU with the Polar Semiconductor.

The leadership UMC has built over the past few years across specialty technologies, including embedded High Voltage, Non-Volatile Memory, and BCD, has and will continue to sustain stable business growth.

Looking ahead to 2026 and beyond, we expect advanced packaging and silicon photonics to serve as a new growth catalysts, positioning UMC to address the evolving needs of a high performance of applications across AI, networking, consumer, automotive and more.

Now let's move on to first quarter 2026 guidance. Our wafer shipment will remain flat. ASP in U.S. dollar will remain firm. Gross margin will be approximately in the high 20% range. Capacity utilization rate will be in the mid-70% range. Our 2026 cash-based CapEx budget will be USD 1.5 billion.

That concludes my comments. Thank you all for your attention. Now we are ready for questions.
