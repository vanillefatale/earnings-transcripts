Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Tim Switzer with KBW.

Timothy Switzer
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

So the first one I have is on the expense trajectory here. There was a little bit of an increase across several line items this quarter. The comp line was flattish, but then marketing was up quite a bit. Equipment went higher. Other expenses seemed a little bit elevated. Is this kind of just some weird one-offs? Or is this indicative of a little bit higher investment costs you guys are putting in the company right now as you look to ramp up?

Andrew LaBenne
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So I'd say, first of all, I think marketing spend was the obvious one that increased quarter-over-quarter. That was I think the vast majority of the increase. And as we signaled last quarter and Investor Day, we're continuing to invest in ramping our marketing channels, improving our capabilities, improving our modeling. And really, a lot of this investment is to help 2026 performance. And so you can probably expect us to continue more of that as we go forward into Q1 as well.

The other expenses, I'd say, were largely noise in the quarter for the most part, even having an Investor Day costs a little bit of money. So you got to factor that in. But in all seriousness, I think as we go into Q1, other investments we'll expect to make would be ramping up our investment in people for the growth in the home improvement business. And then as we're looking to do the rebrand in the first half of 2026, there will be some expenses related to that as well. and all of that is included in the guide.

Scott Sanborn
CEO & Director

I'd say investment, just to be clear, investment in the first half of '26 roll out back half of '26.

Timothy Switzer
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. So you're saying the investment cost should start to moderate into the second half of the year?

Scott Sanborn
CEO & Director

I'd say when we're through the transition, that's right. So we're not being specific on the timing of that yet, but we're obviously starting to work now.

Timothy Switzer
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And your comment on marketing, like is the marketing required for targeted originations, is that higher than what you were maybe previously expecting? Or like what's the efficiency looking like so far?

Scott Sanborn
CEO & Director

A reminder, if you just go back and what we talked about at Investor Day. So one, all of our product categories were growing last year, and we're expecting future growth this year. Not all of them are marketing driven in terms of their originations. So the SBA program and our purchase finance, those are driven by different dynamics as same with home improvement.

But specific to PL, there's really 3 areas that we're pushing on for growth. One is product innovation. We talked about how top-up has successfully driven increases in take rate and higher originations. We have more ideas in the pipeline around the product innovation. There's funnel efficiency. As magic as our experience feels, there is still evolution possible to make it faster and more frictionless, and that will be a growth driver.

And then the third is marketing. And there, we shared we're still -- there are certain things that are quite robust, and I'd say close to very mature like our partnership program, and I think we're getting there on direct mail, and we're well on our way with paid search, but there are other areas that we're still quite early innings at having the right data models, the right attribution and that's paid social display, connected TV.

And I would say those are future growth vectors for us. They're one of many drivers of origination growth. And I think we gave at Investor Day that over the medium term, we think there's a couple of billion dollars' worth of originations to come from those added channels. What you're seeing us do now is normally for -- Tim, you've been following the business for a while. We normally don't push on new initiatives like this in Q4 and Q1. We usually wait until Q2 and Q3 because they are seasonally just a lot more forgiving and favorable.

But given the momentum in the business, we're pulling those in Q4 and Q1, which means they are going to be test programs and I would call this R&D spend, they're always less efficient because it's a learning agenda as opposed to a volume agenda. We're not driving much volume through it, but we are spending dollars. It will be even less efficient when we pull them into less seasonably favorable quarters because response rates and all that are lower. But we think the trade-off is worth it because it sets us up for sustained growth later in the year and in the years beyond.

Timothy Switzer
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Got it. That was all really helpful. One last question and then I'll jump back in the queue. At the Investor Day, your slide deck kind of indicated you're looking for a lower efficiency rate over time relative to '25, I think closer to the 55% to 60% range. But given all the -- like 2026 is kind of a transition year, the accounting is changing a little bit. Is the efficiency ratio moving up in '26 and then it starts to move back down as we get past the impact of the accounting and you guys start to get better scale?

Andrew LaBenne
Chief Financial Officer

That's -- yes, you're precisely right. So if you think about this transition from CECL to fair value, early in '26 or now basically in this first quarter, there's a bit of a tailwind that's created. And we're using some of that tailwind to do these investments that we were just talking about, right, reinvesting because once that tailwind fades, we want to make sure we continue to have momentum in growth, top line and bottom line going forward.

So we're using first part of the year to make those investments to accelerate the back half of the year. Once you get through 2026, that comparison point that impacts efficiency ratio in PPNR basically is gone and then your year-over-year comps will normalize at that point. But what's really important to note is you have these dynamics going on. But what we're getting is more pull-through by making this move, right? So even though you're having some of these impacts on revenue and expenses, what you're pulling through to the bottom line because of the offset in provision is higher.

Operator

And your next question comes from the line of Vincent Caintic with BTIG.

Vincent Caintic
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Thanks for all the detail on the accounting change. So I do want to focus on that very helpful slide with Slide 21. So are these key drivers sort of the discount rate, 7%, is that sort of what we should be thinking about going forward? I think in the prepared remarks, you kind of talked a bit about the large -- the major purchase finance and other things having higher discount rates and higher duration. So as you launch new products, I'm wondering how these assumptions will evolve. And if you could give us like how we should think about the duration of these other products and the discount rates of these other products and coupons as well, that would be very helpful.

Andrew LaBenne
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Great. I mean there's only a certain level of detail we're going to give just for competitive reasons, but it's a great question. And first thing I'd say is just -- it's right on there, but this is illustrative of one vintage coming in. So the 7.3% discount rate in this illustration, we're actually at 7.1% discount rate for the quarter. So we're a little lower than this illustration.

But how that discount rate will move if everything else remains equal, it will depend on the mix of loans that we're putting into fair value. And so some of the businesses like major purchase finance that have longer duration and the less developed secondary market or marketplace are going to have a higher discount rate, not necessarily all of that is true for home improvement, where there's a very developed secondary market and marketplace, but it also is longer duration.

So net-net, you'll have some offsetting effects on an asset class like that. But over time, it's going to depend on what the mix within our held for sale portfolio looks like, but you can expect that we're probably adding more diversification of those other product types coming into the portfolio.

Vincent Caintic
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

That's helpful. And then I guess, relatedly, now that the accounting is sort of making the market -- the held for investment loans look similar to the marketplace loans, at least from your income statement and balance sheet now, like your thoughts on the mix between what you will sell, what you'll maybe season and then sell versus what you would retain on the balance sheet?

Andrew LaBenne
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Yes, interesting, and I'm glad you asked because there's another point I want to make as well. So we will continue to have an inventory of held-for-sale loans. As we've said before, we found that program to be very helpful to onboard new investors and to make opportunistic sales and maybe better prices than we would otherwise get.

There's actually one new development in CECL accounting this quarter, which could be beneficial, not for us, but for potential bank buyers. So I think one of the reasons that the bank pipeline has been slow to evolve is banks having to take that upfront CECL charge and sometimes it's difficult to get over that hump before you start building a portfolio of purchase LendingClub loans.

Under the new CECL guidance, if you buy loans seasoned more than 90 days, you no longer have that upfront impact as you would if you were originating loans or buying newly originated loans. So I'm not saying this is an immediate unlock in the bank pipeline is about to explode open. But I think net-net, it will be a positive for bank investors that are considering purchasing from us. So for all the reasons I mentioned before and for that reason, we'll continue to hold a held for sale portfolio available for sale.

Scott Sanborn
CEO & Director

Yes. Do you want to talk a little bit about the other part of the question, which was now that they look the same in-period aspirations for balance sheet growth, we gave some targets at Investor Day.

Andrew LaBenne
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I mean, I think in terms of balance sheet growth and aspirations, nothing has changed from Investor Day regarding that. As far as our mix going forward in terms of structured certificate securities, and I'll just call it whole loans, which would be loans held for investment and loans held for sale, we'd say that, that distribution that we're at today probably roughly holds as we go forward in terms of our forecast.

Operator

And your next question comes from John Hecht of Jefferies.

John Hecht
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Can you guys hear me?

Scott Sanborn
CEO & Director

Yes.

John Hecht
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I just -- one question I have is just on the fair value adjustment. You give the discount rate. Is there some way we can take that and decipher what the kind of annualized loss rate might be, I guess, in your primary product?

Andrew LaBenne
Chief Financial Officer

I don't know that you can exactly get to that. What we are going to do next -- starting next year is we'll update our disclosures to include the charge-off, much like we do today just for the CECL portfolio. We'll start to do that for the CECL -- the runoff CECL portfolio and the held for sale portfolio combined. But currently, under our platform mix, we're still in that 4.5% to 5% loss rate estimate on an ANCL basis. And then as we add new products, we think they have similar profiles. But obviously, we might move around our mix that could have some minor adjustments to those numbers.

John Hecht
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. But the general tenor of the credit is consistent with what you've been underwriting for the last several quarters?

Andrew LaBenne
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. No major pivot.

Scott Sanborn
CEO & Director

Yes. If you just think about, John, what we're doing is we're taking the capabilities, but I think we've demonstrated that we're quite good at appropriately assessing the risk, pricing the risk and delivering value through the cycle from -- all the way through servicing. We're just applying it to different categories, but it is the same core skill set. So different channels have slightly different SKUs, but the overall return profile, coupons and all that are pretty similar. Like purchase finance, as an example, has a higher average FICO score, but the actual ROEs on that, we expect to be similar and in line. And home improvement obviously has homeowners SKUs heavily homeowners and slightly higher coupon.

John Hecht
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just so I'm clear, the revenue yield on the loans is going to be more akin to the discount rate -- so the net interest margin will be reflective of that lower yield, but the offset from the upfront fair value mark is bigger than that. Is that an accurate description?

Andrew LaBenne
Chief Financial Officer

The coupon in the NIM -- in the net interest margin table will be higher than the discount rate, where the offset will be -- is in those fair value adjustments downward. So what you need to do is take the component of interest income, offset with the component -- the fair value adjustments from noninterest income, and that will get you the revenue yield equal to the discount rate.

John Hecht
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then from that, you also subtract charge-offs in the fair value marks. Is that correct?

Andrew LaBenne
Chief Financial Officer

Those are included in those adjustments.

John Hecht
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then final question is, it seems like a fairly good environment from the perspective of relatively stable credit. I think the macro expectations are reasonably constructive too. And then there's a lot of capital in the markets. Maybe could you guys describe your thoughts on the operating market and the competitive environment within your subset of products?

Andrew LaBenne
Chief Financial Officer

Well, I'll start with the marketplace and Scott can cover the credit dynamics and competition. The marketplace is very healthy. There is a -- as you said, there is a lot of capital out there to be deployed, very active environment. We're the insurance capital that we're now starting to sell loans to and having more conversations, we think has been a great addition to our marketplace customers that we are working with now. And as I mentioned, the -- this change in CECL accounting hopefully can give a little more tailwind to opening up some more banks as well.

Scott Sanborn
CEO & Director

Yes. And on the competitive front, John, I'd say, I think we say this almost every call, this is a competitive market. It has always been a competitive market. Who we are competing with at any point in the cycle changes. This past quarter, we had a fairly aggressive, ambitious, reasonably new entrants kind of pull out of the market similar to Marcus' arrival with much fanfare and then retraction. So we have that, but that's offset by some of the direct fintech competition who are on balance being more aggressive given the availability of marketplace capital.

So I'd say no real change in our view of how that's affecting what we do. We feel very good about our ability to compete. We've shared multiple times statistics, not only on the credit side, but also on our pull-through rate in our marketing and how we're able to convert the customers we want. So -- but we're just going to be very selective. And we agree. We're -- as you can see in our materials, our credit looks very stable, and that's because we're maintaining our discipline. It's not clear that we're seeing that across the full industry. So we'll be watching that.

Operator

And your next question comes from Kyle Joseph of Stephens. [Operator Instructions]

Kyle Joseph
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Sorry about that. You guys hear me all right?

Scott Sanborn
CEO & Director

Yes.

Kyle Joseph
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Sorry about that. Anyway, yes, kind of piggybacking on John's question on macro, just looking at your DQ curves on Slide 9. Anything you'd say about kind of the K-shaped economy and how you're thinking about 2026. We've been reading a lot about elevated tax refunds. But yes, just kind of a little bit deeper dive in terms of macro and how you're thinking about things.

Scott Sanborn
CEO & Director

Yes. So I think most important thing is post the inflationary period a few years ago, we did move upmarket, upmarket in terms of income, upmarket in terms of FICO. And as you can see there, we're seeing stable results. The customer we serve who we call the motivated middle, we think, represent a lot of TAM for us both immediately today, but also over time as we evolve the use cases and credit products we serve at. On tax refunds, we are expecting, right, or it is expected, it's not us, that this will be a larger-than-usual year, that can have a positive effect on payment and a temporarily downward effect on loan demand, but all of that's factored into our guide.

Kyle Joseph
Stephens Inc., Research Division

I got it. And then not asking you guys to speculate any more than we can, but I think it would be a little bit remiss if we didn't address the potential rate cap, obviously, given kind of your core product is on credit card refi, but just kind of want to get your initial thoughts and how you guys are thinking about everything that's out there.

Scott Sanborn
CEO & Director

Yes. I mean, obviously, there's not a lot of specifics on what -- how this could actually take shape and what it could do. And I think there's, at the moment, not a lot of confidence that at least as initially articulated anything like that would come through. Our view is there is an affordable alternative to credit cards available today, no government action required, and that's LendingClub. And we're already saving people 700 basis points off of the cards and no price control is needed.

Operator

And your next question comes from David Scharf of Citizens Capital Markets.

David Scharf
Citizens JMP Securities, LLC, Research Division

Most have been addressed. So a couple of things I just wanted to ask if you could clarify. One, actually just very near term, on the Q1 origination outlook, did I hear you correctly that the guide kind of factors in a larger-than-normal refund season in paydown cycle?

Scott Sanborn
CEO & Director

Well, what I'd say is I think that's pretty difficult to factor in with any degree of specificity. But our experience has been that larger-than-normal refund seasons, as I said, kind of flow through our business, as I indicated, which is customer payment rates are higher. So you see good DQ trends, but you can see maybe a different demand for credit temporarily. I wouldn't expect anything significant, but obviously, that will be difficult to really predict, and we're not going to give intra-quarter guidance, and hard to measure the impact of that together with any other broader macro events going on. So we're very confident that we've got a lot of tools in the toolkit to deliver the outlook that we provided.

David Scharf
Citizens JMP Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Got it. Fair enough. And then just digging back to the fair value assumptions. It sounds like on the next quarter Q1 call, we'll get kind of the obviously, current period losses and charge-off rate embedded in that change in fair value line. Is it -- I think John may have asked this, but is it fair to assume that embedded in your earnings guidance is sort of a flattish year-over-year loss rate in that fair value mark? Or is there anything about the asset mix? There have been so many references to larger purchase longer duration loans. Does -- are there any nuances that might kind of raise the loss rate purely due to the asset mix?

Andrew LaBenne
Chief Financial Officer

No, I don't think so. I mean I think we're obviously assuming a stable environment as we go through the year. We will have an increase in duration because as our purchase finance -- major purchase finance business is growing and doing well and home improvement will come on. So duration will go up. But in terms of the ANCLs, I'm not expecting a major shift in that. Now I think if you look at the net charge-off rate, there's seasonality, there's vintages seasoning in there. There's a lot of portfolio mix. But in terms of the annual loss rates, we're not assuming a major change in those numbers.

David Scharf
Citizens JMP Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And regarding the vintages, obviously, this is -- we're laying to rest the slide where you give the sort of components of provisioning and reserving for amortized cost accounting. Is there a way to translate that sort of most recent vintage macro layer, that 1%, 1.5% kind of conservative upfront provisioning. Does that translate into certain number of basis points of discount on a day 1 fair value mark going forward?

Andrew LaBenne
Chief Financial Officer

Well, under fair value, we're not explicitly layering in qualitative reserves as we do under CECL. So it's a difference in methodology. Now if we see more stress coming through the portfolio, we may have -- we may take that through the fair value marks in some manner. But we're not going to speculate on what's going to happen 2 years from now to the economy in terms of how we reserve, which I think has been personally one of the most frustrating parts of CECL accounting.

David Scharf
Citizens JMP Securities, LLC, Research Division

Yes. No, fair enough. I think you're seventh company we cover that's adopted the fair value option.

Operator

And your next question comes from Giuliano Bologna of Compass Point. [Operator Instructions]

Giuliano Anderes-Bologna
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Congrats on another good quarter, and I appreciate all the new detail on the fair value disclosures. When I -- one thing that -- I don't know if it's come up yet, but there wouldn't -- under fair value, there shouldn't be any more deferrals when it comes to marketing expenses. Is there a rough way to think about where your marketing expenses would be as a percentage of volume in the fourth quarter and third quarter, for example, just to get a rough sense of what your marketing costs would have translated to on a pro forma basis?

Andrew LaBenne
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I mean I think it would have been higher. Obviously, we haven't disclosed the number. I mean, I think the -- obviously, the offset to that is also higher origination fees or origination fees are no longer deferred and net-net, we're a net beneficiary of those 2 dynamics happening together, right? So I think if you're thinking about the marketing spend deferral, then you probably got to think about the origination fee deferral as well.

Giuliano Anderes-Bologna
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Yes. And obviously, the net impact is positive. So that's significantly positive. When I think about the outlook for volumes for the -- or at least in the guide for the year, it implies, especially after 1Q that you'd kind of reaccelerate from a volume perspective, that it'll probably be flat to up slightly in the first quarter, but then you'd see a pretty good reacceleration in volumes to hit kind of the midpoint of the origination volume guidance. Is that a good way to think of it that you should have a good step up in 2Q, 3Q?

Andrew LaBenne
Chief Financial Officer

That's correct. Yes. That's exactly right. And there's -- part of that is our normal seasonality, but obviously, we're -- we believe we're going to have more benefits beyond that from the newer business lines that we're launching and the investments in scaling marketing paying off.

Operator

And next in the queue is Tim Switzer of KBW.

Timothy Switzer
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

One of the follow-ups I have is just on AI. How -- I know you guys are using that quite a bit in the back office, but what areas that are a little bit more forward-facing that is helping you with either growth or maybe getting a little bit better pricing or demand? I know you guys had like the Cushion acquisition a few years ago. And I think you've mentioned it's helped speed up the doc verification process as applications come through. But just wondering if you guys could update us on that.

Scott Sanborn
CEO & Director

Yes. So I'd say, at this point, there's probably not a department in the company that is untouched in some way. I think we have over 60 initiatives underway across the company. And you're right, they range from operations efficiency, guiding agents on next best action, taking sort of diverting customer contacts whatsoever to compliance, marketing material generation, audit testing and generation. Obviously, heavy, heavy, heavy use in the engineering group for code development and streamlining our QA efforts.

On the growth side, you've hit a couple of areas that we're really focused on. There's obviously longer pole in the tent, marketing and credit, continued evolution of our efforts there, which we won't talk about too much because we view that as part of our secret sauce. But then within the customer experience, the Cushion acquisition, including the team is really -- we will be evolving the DebtIQ experience to bring more intelligence to evaluating people's transactions and history and helping recommend actions to customers that improve their financial position.

So -- and the one you mentioned we put into test in Q4 and are expanding across the board is for the rare cases where we do need to require some kind of documentation that we can't get electronically using AI to both assess whether the documents are what we ask for, whether or not they are real and not fraudulent and then to extract that information, populate models and render a decision is all improving or reducing the friction in the funnel and improving our pull-through. So there's just a ton of things happening across the company.

Timothy Switzer
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Got it. And the last question I have, it's a difficult one, but you guys -- the guide for this year is the 13% to 15% near-term ROTCE guide you gave, can you kind of help us map out how we get to the 18% to 20% medium-term target over time? Like with this fair value accounting, is it a gradual steady build quarter-over-quarter as you guys continue to scale up? Or is there a point -- and I know it can -- this is very dependent on the pace of originations and the seasoning of the portfolio. But is there a point where maybe the ROTCE increase starts to slow down as the portfolio gets larger and that day 2 impact on the fair value gets larger? Or am I thinking about that a little bit wrong?

Andrew LaBenne
Chief Financial Officer

I think -- no, I mean, I think it will be our goal would be a steady increase up towards those medium-term targets. The dynamics of moving from CECL to fair value, I will say by the time we're entering 2027, they are largely -- they should largely be behind us. And from there, we're continuing growth through all the steps we laid out at Investor Day, mainly growing originations, growing margin, expecting a little help from the Fed, obviously, but that's not the biggest component of it.

Scott Sanborn
CEO & Director

Growing originations, growing the balance sheet, both are going to be accretive to the bottom line.

Timothy Switzer
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Yes. I guess another way to think about it is the impact to profitability is relatively steady as long as you continue to grow the balance sheet at 25%. So like if you're growing it with say, $4 billion of loans or if you're growing it at $7 billion of loans, that doesn't impact the profitability as long as you're still growing at a similar level. Is that the right way to think about it?

Andrew LaBenne
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I mean the only growth headwind that we used to have was CECL, right? And so with that gone, the growth, we should have positive operating leverage from growth or maybe I should say, positive pull-through now from growth as we grow over these next 3 years. So -- but the keys are really grow the business lines we have, the expansion in home improvement, growing originations, growing the balance sheet and then pulling it through to net income.

Operator

There are no further questions online. I will now turn the call back to Artem Nalivayko for retail investor questions.

Artem Nalivayko
VP and Head of FP&A and Investor Relations

All right. Thank you, Kevin. So Scott and Drew, we have a couple of questions here that were submitted by our retail investors via Say Technologies and e-mail. So the first question is on the rebrand. The question is, once the name change has been made, what are the marketing plans that you have in place?

Scott Sanborn
CEO & Director

Yes. So just a reminder, what's the intent of the rebrand. The initial LendingClub brand really was tied to our pioneering model of peer-to-peer lending, which is obviously no longer part of the model. We're now a bank. We don't just do lending. We've launched multiple consumer-facing savings products, and checking, of which the name LendingClub on your debit card is quite strange.

So the rebrand is really meant to capture the broader ambition of the company, what we do for our customers beyond just lending. So plan is to do that later this year. Our first focus, there could be a question of like what are we doing between now and then? We are mapping out the literally thousands of touch points we have with our customers across e-mail, mobile app, third-party sites and call center and all the rest and making sure that we've got everything captured, make sure our equity translates from the old brand to the new brand. And then, yes, we will be putting some weight behind the new brand.

I wouldn't expect -- we're not going to go from being a highly data-driven, efficient curve-oriented direct response marketer to getting stadium rights in 2026. So you're not going to see a big step change in how we think about marketing. But this is absolutely the beginning of us moving further up the funnel, if you will, as our offering to consumers broadens and what we stand for broadens, the marketing tactics we can use can also get more broad. And so we do expect over time that you'll be seeing us beyond these direct response channels, just won't be immediate.

Artem Nalivayko
VP and Head of FP&A and Investor Relations

Great. So the second question, I saw a recent press release on a partnership with a company called Wonder. Can you please elaborate on that?

Scott Sanborn
CEO & Director

Yes. So if you recall in Investor Day, we talked about how we're taking our capabilities in unsecured consumer and which is applied -- our largest use case is debt consolidation, credit card refi, but those same capabilities apply to any way you can use a personal loan, which is to finance any large purchase. We've been seeing really great traction there. We think there's a real -- we feel a real need in the space, which is we've got the resilient, stable funding of a bank, but we've got the customer experience and the speed and the interaction model of a fintech. So we've been gaining distribution and growing that business.

Our kind of core verticals that we're in today, elective medical, dental, teeth implants, fertility, tutoring, a few others. And we're expanding into others, ophthalmology, wellness, and we're testing some purchase verticals. So that's what that is. These are all -- these and other things, which -- some of which get announced and some of which we're just doing as part of our testing are all meant to assess consumer demand in incremental verticals that will diversify our use case, diversify our acquisition channels and provide future vectors for growth. So excited about it, seeing very solid traction in the business overall and are excited to keep growing it.

Artem Nalivayko
VP and Head of FP&A and Investor Relations

Perfect. And last question, just in terms of increasing shareholder value in the long term, how does leadership intend to drive shareholder value?

Andrew LaBenne
Chief Financial Officer

All right. Well, always a great question, and thank you, a retail investor for that. I'd say the number -- rather than me explaining it all again on this call, I'd say the #1 thing investors should do is go watch our Investor Day that we did in November, because I think there is a lot of time dedicated to going through the strategy and how we expect it to evolve over the next several years.

But citing what we accomplished in 2025, a lot of which we already covered on the call, for the full year, we grew originations 33%. We grew revenue 27% and we grew diluted EPS by 158% year-over-year. So I think 2025 was a great year. And if you look at our guide for 2026, we're looking to obviously improve upon performance again as we go into this year. And then finally, we announced the share repurchase and acquisition program of $100 million, which we think is also beneficial to shareholders now and in the future.

Artem Nalivayko
VP and Head of FP&A and Investor Relations

All right. Thanks, Drew. All right. So with that, we'll wrap up our fourth quarter and full year 2025 earnings conference call. Thank you all for joining us today. And if you have any questions, please e-mail us at IR@lendingclub.com. Thank you.
