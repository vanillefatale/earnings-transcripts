Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results. It's great to be with you again. When we recently gathered in New York for Investor Day, I said this was the start of a new era for Dollar Tree, one company, one brand, one focus. Our energy is now directed towards strengthening and growing the Dollar Tree business. We delivered a high-quality quarter, accompanied by mid-single-digit comps, above outlook earnings and strong end-of-quarter momentum heading into the holidays. These results speak to our disciplined execution and focused strategy.

Let me start by framing the quarter at a high level, and then Stewart will take you through the financial details. First, I'd like to highlight the strength of our discretionary business, which showed its first positive year-over-year mix shift since Q1 of 2022. We believe this strength illustrates how our exceptional value proposition, including our growing multi-price assortment is resonating with our shoppers by helping them meet their needs and desires in the budget-constrained environment that many consumers find themselves today.

The 3 pillars that define Dollar Tree are value, convenience and discovery. Those are not slogans. They're how we win. They describe a brand that offers customers compelling values across a variety of price points that help them do more with less in stores that are easy to shop and full of surprises worth discovering. While the consumer landscape remains uneven, the underlying story remains consistent. All consumers are seeking value. Marrying that value-seeking behavior with convenience and discovery is the intersection where Dollar Tree thrives. And the evidence is clear.

Dollar Tree continues to gain share and attract new shoppers while continuing to serve its large and loyal base of core customers. Today, we serve an increasingly broad spectrum of shoppers from core value-focused households to middle and higher-income shoppers who are making deliberate choices about how and where they spend. We had 3 million more households shop with us in Q3 this year compared to Q3 last year.

Approximately 60% of these incremental shoppers came from higher-income households, those earning over $100,000, 30% from middle-income households, those earning between $60,000 to $100,000 with the rest from lower-income households, those earning under $60,000. Importantly, Q3 spending growth was broad-based across all income sub cohorts, including households earning below $20,000. To us, this demonstrates that Dollar Tree isn't just for tough times or for those with limited resources.

Dollar Tree is for smart shoppers across all income brackets where value, convenience and discovery matter. At the same time, higher income households are trading into Dollar Tree, lower-income households are depending on us more than ever. For example, the average spend for lower-income households grew more than twice as fast in the third quarter as the average spend for higher income households.

While part of this reflects the fact that higher income households are typically earlier in their customer life cycle with us, the data clearly shows that our core customer remains loyal and deeply engaged. She's balancing her household budget carefully and continues to count on Dollar Tree for essentials and increasingly for the seasonal and discretionary items that bring joy to her and her family.

Over time, our goal is to inspire the same level of loyalty in our newer higher income customers that we see in our core customers. While the average per household spend for our higher income customers is currently lower, even given their higher income, larger average basket size and ability to spend more, this is a simple function of trip frequency. Because many of our higher income customers are still early in their relationship with Dollar Tree, their purchase frequency has significant room to grow.

Over time, we believe that growing trip frequency among these higher-income customers, given their propensity to build bigger baskets will be a powerful growth driver for Dollar Tree. This is why our brand promise matters so much right now. We make it easier for customers to do more with less without trading down on quality or experience. And that is what keeps our traffic and baskets healthy in a cautious consumer environment.

And with that, let's take a look at some of our Q3 highlights. Comparable sales increased 4.2%, a nice acceleration from the quarter-to-date trend of 3.8% we shared in mid-October. As the results suggest, October finished strong, driven by momentum in our multi-price assortment and a great Halloween. Our Q3 comp was all ticket-driven as traffic was slightly negative.

Discretionary mix improved 40 basis points to 50.5%. Comp increased 4.8% in discretionary and 3.5% in consumables. Gross margin performance exceeded expectations, reflecting strong operational execution and cost discipline. Adjusted EPS of $1.21 was nicely above our outlook, and Stewart will go through the drivers behind this upside in his remarks. We believe these results reflect our sharper focus and more disciplined execution. Multi-price was a key driver of our Q3 momentum.

As a reminder, multi-price is a deliberate long-term data-driven strategy that began back in 2019 to make Dollar Tree more relevant, flexible and profitable. Multi-price is about evolving our assortment over time to include new, more relevant and attractively valued items that we could not offer at a fixed price point of $1 or $1.25. Multi-price is one of the most important strategic shifts in Dollar Tree's modern history, and it's working. As we highlighted at our Investor Day, the roughly 5.5% annual comp we've averaged since breaking the dollar in 2022 is among the very best in all of retail.

Those of you who attended our Investor Day may recall a slide from Stewart's presentation, where he demonstrated how expanded multi-price penetration in categories like electronics, hardware and Easter had a meaningfully positive impact on sales and per unit profitability. We've reproduced a similar analysis on our multi-price Halloween assortment this year, which we've included in our supplemental presentation available on our Investor Relations website.

Our Halloween performance this year is another clear example of the power of multi-price. This year, our Halloween assortment generated over $200 million in sales, an all-time record. But to see the full impact of multi-price, let's go back to Halloween 2022 when multi-price was still in its infancy. That year, multi-price represented about 3% of units sold, 10% of sales and 7% of merchandise gross margin across our full Halloween assortment.

Fast forward to 2025 on a 25% larger base of sales, where multi-price accounted for roughly 1/4 of our total Halloween sales and merchandise gross margin, but only 8% of Halloween units sold. We are continually engineering incremental value and profitability drivers into our multi-price assortment. Across Halloween this year, each multi-price item that we sold generated 3.5x more profit than each non-multi-price item we sold. This is a full turn higher than Halloween 2022.

By combining this increased per unit profitability with a higher multi-price mix, we were able to generate approximately 25% more margin dollars from our Halloween assortment this year compared to 2022, while selling approximately 10% fewer units. And this is just the positive impact on merchandise margin. It doesn't take into consideration any labor or distribution cost savings that come from handling fewer units.

Looking at it this way, multi-price is a powerful growth and profitability driver. It broadens our value proposition and relevance to our customers, allows us to compete more effectively, helps drive cost leverage and sets the business up for long-term success. More importantly, we are just getting started. Multi-price is not a one-and-done proposition. We expect these dynamics to play out across every holiday and special occasion and strengthen as our multi-price penetration expands. Over time, our customers will let us know what the right multi-price mix ultimately is, but we're confident that it's meaningfully higher than where we are today.

So let's take a look at some broader merchandising highlights from the quarter. Discretionary categories accelerated through the quarter with standout performances in party and home decor. Consumables were steady, led by household cleaning, personal care, snacks and cookies. Seasonal performance was strong, particularly towards the end of the quarter. We planned the inventory carefully, had strong in-store execution and are pleased with our sell-through. Those wins are proof points for our merchandising strategy and ever-changing more relevant assortment that drives trip completion and more importantly, enhances profitability and margin performance.

Today, with a wider assortment of multi-price merchandise and restickering largely complete, 85% of the items in our store are still priced at $2 or below, offering a broad range of price points while staying firmly grounded in value preserves the integrity of the Dollar Tree brand. We believe time, convenience, pack size and quality are all part of our customers' value calculation and so is an expanded range of products that address a wide range of shopping occasions.

When a customer can fill a basket with snacks, cleaning supplies, home decor items and seasonal products, all at a great value, that's when the Dollar Tree magic is on full display. Q3 results were also powered by strong execution in our stores, supply chain and support functions. At Investor Day, Jocy Konrad spoke about our commitment to simplify work, elevate standards and empower our people. In Q3, we saw measurable improvement in these key areas. On store standards, we've rolled out new tools and training that simplify store routines and improve accountability.

The results are visible with cleaner aisles, stock shelves and faster checkouts with more to come. On associate engagement, our Race to G.O.L.D. initiative continues to gain traction. As we've increased our investment in training and career progression, we've seen continued improvement in turnover. In supply chain, the network is performing at a very high level.

Service levels and in-stocks coming out of this year's peak season are among the highest we've seen and our planned increases in distribution capacity over the next several years should allow us to unlock even greater operating efficiencies and distribution cost savings. In technology, we continue to modernize our back-office systems and upgrades to our infrastructure. These investments are simplifying work and enabling smarter decision-making in merchandising and replenishment.

All of this comes down to one thing, making it easier for our teams to deliver a consistently great experience for our customers. With the Family Dollar sale behind us, we are already seeing measurable improvements in our culture and performance. We are fully aligned behind one brand, one set of priorities and one mission with leadership and investment focus concentrated on growing Dollar Tree.

Every decision across product, stores, technology, supply chain and people is aligned to strengthening one business. That alignment brings speed and accountability. Teams test, learn and scale faster, and we now measure progress across a single set of metrics directly tied to creating shareholder value.

We are moving forward with purpose, clarity and conviction guided by the 5 strategic priorities we laid out at our Investor Day, surprise and delight our customer with an expanded, more relevant assortment, manage expenses with agility by controlling the cost of the goods we sell and managing our SG&A with discipline to drive operating leverage and profitability, create a strong connection with our customers with cost-effective, quick return, data-driven marketing, open more stores and improve the condition of our fleet; and finally, improve the in-store experience for our customers by raising the bar on our store standards.

At the foundation of these priorities are a fast, flexible and efficient supply chain and disciplined financial management that focuses on high-return investments and smart capital allocation. And at the forefront of our success is our people, the more than 150,000 associates who show up every day to serve our customers, support their colleagues and strengthen the communities where we operate. They are the reason we do what we do and the driving force behind every decision we make.

As you heard me emphasize at Investor Day, we manage this business with a focus on what I call the say-do ratio, making clear commitments and delivering on those commitments. This mindset builds trust and accountability across the organization, and we believe that maintaining alignment between what we say and what we do is how we deliver consistent performance over time. In summary, we are pleased with our Q3 results. We're building a stronger foundation for the future, and we're confident about the direction we're heading. With that, I'll turn it over to Stewart.

Stewart Glendinning
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Q3 comp sales increased 4.2% and adjusted EPS was $1.21. Both our comp performance and our adjusted EPS were ahead of the expectations we shared in mid-October. The 40 basis points of Q3 comp acceleration between the middle and end of October was driven by a late but strong performance in Halloween sales on the back of a deeper multi-price assortment and excellent execution across our stores. Dollar Tree's seasonal assortment and value resonated strongly with shoppers.

Our EPS improvement versus expectations was largely driven by freight, higher discretionary sales mix and SG&A. With that, let's go over the details of our third quarter results. Q3 net sales increased 9.4% to $4.7 billion. Consistent with our expectations, Q3 comp growth was primarily ticket driven as traffic was slightly negative. Average ticket growth was supported by increased multi-price penetration, particularly across our Halloween assortment and the pricing actions we began rolling out last quarter.

Importantly, strong execution around merchandise cost, tariff mitigation, freight and operating expenses helped drive profitability. Q3 gross margin expanded 40 basis points to 35.8%. These results reflect the strength of our assortment and the agility of our merchandising, supply chain and store operations teams.

The key drivers of this improvement were merchandise margin, successful execution of our 5 merchant levers: renegotiation, reengineering, shifting country of origin, discontinuing and targeted price changes, all contributed to our ability to manage increased costs from tariffs. Freight, import and inbound freight rates were favorable versus prior year with lower spot market utilization and better container flow-through at our DCs. Domestic transportation costs were also favorable.

Mix, discretionary and seasonal categories, particularly Halloween, were stronger than expected, increasing the realized mark-on -- markdowns. As part of the ongoing strategic initiative to increase shelf productivity that we outlined at Investor Day, we identified and wrote off various slow-turning SKUs. This will create room for more productive items and help optimize storage space utilization in our stores and DCs. The total impact to Q3 earnings was approximately $56 million or approximately $0.21 of EPS.

We believe we will see increased sales and profits per store going forward as we bring in new items or reallocate shelf space to existing but faster-turning products. Shrink. Overall, shrink was higher than last year, but in line with our expectations. These drivers taken together drove the Q3 gross margin performance. At the Dollar Tree segment level, our Q3 adjusted SG&A rate increased 160 basis points to 26.2%, driven by higher store payroll related to wage increases and restickering, general liability claims costs and D&A from elevated store investments. These were partially offset by sales leverage.

As a reminder, we do not expect costs related to restickering and other price-related activities to be repeated next year. Also, the wage-related payroll increases this year were expected and planned. Looking forward to next year, we expect wage growth to moderate. As we discussed at Investor Day, on a go-forward basis, our goal is to grow Dollar Tree segment SG&A per store below the rate of inflation while reinvesting selectively in high-return initiatives that enhance the customer experience and the long-term profitability of our store base.

We believe this will result in future SG&A cost leverage. Adjusted corporate SG&A should be considered net of TSA income because of the costs we carry in order to service the Family Dollar transition. Using this lens, our adjusted corporate SG&A rate, net of the $24 million of TSA income leveraged 80 basis points to 2.4%, a positive step toward our goal of reducing corporate SG&A to 2% of sales by fiscal 2028.

Adjusted operating income increased 4.1% to $345 million. Our operating margin contracted by 30 basis points to 7.3%, reflecting the offset between the gross margin expansion and SG&A deleveraging, partially driven by cost headwinds such as restickering that will not repeat in 2026. Keep in mind our comments with respect to anticipated SG&A leverage next year at both the Dollar Tree segment and the corporate level. Net interest expense and our adjusted tax rate were broadly in line with expectations.

Adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased 12% to $1.21. Moving on to the balance sheet and free cash flow. Inventory was down $143 million or 5% versus prior year, while sales increased by 9.4%, our store count increased by 4.5%, and we ramped up our DCs in Ocala and Odessa. This reduction reflects our focused efforts to increase inventory turns and improve shelf productivity.

We ended the quarter with $620 million of commercial paper notes outstanding and $595 million in cash and cash equivalents. On the Q3 cash flow statement, we generated $319 million in cash from operating activities and had capital expenditures of $376 million. This resulted in negative free cash flow in the quarter of $57 million. Year-to-date, we've generated $88 million of free cash flow.

As a reminder, the fourth quarter is our highest cash-generating quarter because of normally higher levels of sales and because our capital expenditures skew towards the first 3 quarters of the year. In Q3, we purchased 4.1 million shares for $399 million, including excise tax. Subsequent to quarter end, we repurchased an additional 1.7 million shares for $176 million.

Year-to-date, we've completed $1.5 billion of share repurchases or approximately 16.7 million shares at an average price of $90 per share. This represents approximately 8% of the shares we had outstanding at the beginning of the year. Our liquidity remains healthy. Our balance sheet remains flexible, and we have ample capacity to fund our growth and return significant capital to shareholders.

Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged: number one, invest in growth; number two, maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet; and number three, return capital to shareholders. Looking ahead, we expect Q4 comps will come in between 4% and 6%, which should support net sales of $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion and adjusted EPS in the range of $2.40 to $2.60.

On a full year basis, this would raise our comp outlook to between 5% and 5.5% and our adjusted EPS outlook to $5.60 to $5.80. The underlying assumptions incorporated into our full year outlook are as follows: net sales of approximately $19.35 billion to $19.45 billion. Gross margin expansion of approximately 50 to 60 basis points, reflecting sustained favorability in merchandise margin, freight and occupancy leverage with some offset from markdown and shrink.

Dollar Tree segment SG&A deleverage of approximately 120 basis points, primarily driven by higher store payroll related to wage increases and restickering and to a lesser extent, facilities costs and D&A. Corporate SG&A costs. We expect corporate SG&A net of $55 million of TSA income to decrease by approximately 3% year-over-year.

Net interest expense of approximately $85 million to $90 million, which is about $10 million to $15 million below our prior outlook, an effective tax rate of approximately 25%. Shares outstanding of approximately $206.4 million, reflecting our share repurchase activity through December 2. We remain on track to meet our full year CapEx target of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion.

We understand that at this point, many of you are shifting your attention to next year. As is customary, we intend to give a detailed outlook for 2026 on our next earnings call in March. With that said, I will remind you of the directional outlook we provided at our Investor Day, where we outlined an algorithm for adjusted EPS to grow at a 12% to 15% CAGR through 2028, supported by underlying EPS growth of 8% to 10%, with the balance being driven by the unwind of certain discrete items, mostly affecting 2026 with some residual carryover into 2027.

To review the underlying details of the algorithm, I direct you to our Investor Day presentation, which is archived on our IR site, and we will give you more specifics in any updates next quarter. To wrap up, we're executing well against the road map we shared with you in mid-October. Each day, we continue to see tangible proof that the fundamental appeal of this business, value, convenience and discovery is resonating with customers and translating into strong financial results. With that, I'll turn things back over to Mike. Mike?

Michael Creedon
CEO & Director

Thanks, Stewart. Let me wrap up by putting Q3 in the broader context of where we are and where we're going. When we shared our road map at Investor Day, we said this transformation was about focus, consistency and accountability. We believe Q3 was a strong proof point that our strategy is working. We delivered above-market comps, expanded gross margin and continued to make meaningful cultural progress across the organization.

Today, Dollar Tree is a pure-play value retailer with the scale and focus to compete at the highest level. Post Family Dollar, we have clarity of purpose and our teams are responding with renewed intensity. As we look to Q4, the setup is solid. Halloween was great, and our Thanksgiving and Christmas assortments are resonating with our customers as we remain focused on consistently delivering unbeatable wow value and the thrill of the hunt experience.

As 2025 winds down, let me wrap up by saying, first, to our associates, thank you. Your dedication, creativity and pride in the work you do are what makes Dollar Tree special. To our customers, thank you for your trust and loyalty for choosing us for the moments big and small that matter the most in your daily lives. And to our shareholders, thank you for your continued confidence and partnership. With that, Stewart and I are happy to take your questions. .
