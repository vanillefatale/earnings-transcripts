[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.

Jolie Wasserman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

This is Jolie Wasserman on for Chris. Our first question is more how you're thinking about the way the consumer is going to show up this holiday, since you did move Way Day back a few weeks, and from some -- away from some of these more major promos out there across retail like Prime Day. Does this mean you're anticipating spending is going to be more spread out this year? Or are you seeing more of an urgency to get out ahead of the potential 232 tariffs?

Niraj Shah
Co-Founder, Co-Chairman & CEO

Jolie, this is Niraj. Thanks for your question. Well, I mean, there's kind of a few different things wrapped up in there. What I would say it on the tariffs, we really have not seen any consumer behavior based on the tariffs. So as we mentioned earlier on the call, the minor, minor pull forwards we saw were -- lasted days in duration and were very small. So we don't really think there's any tariff-induced behavior. We actually think the holiday shopping is probably going to be similar to past years. And so what we did with Way Day is we actually went back to the timing that we actually had, not last year, but the 2 prior years. So it's the same timing of '22 and '23, which is late in October. And last year, in '24, we did move it earlier in October. And what we kind of came to the conclusion for is that we think that the period that we've always done it in, late October, is probably more optimal, and so that we just went back to that. So I would just -- you should just view it is, yes, we're running kind of a very similar seasonal cadence to what we traditionally do.

Jolie Wasserman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

That makes sense. And our second question is just more broadly, how you're thinking about 2026 abilities to lap accelerated share gains, whether price increases are expected to become a bigger driver and also just how you're thinking about getting some more of the gross margin, advertising margin expansions for 2026 more broadly?

Niraj Shah
Co-Founder, Co-Chairman & CEO

Yes, yes. Great. I mean, so for 2026, what I'd say is, we're definitely focused on driving further top and bottom line growth, and EBITDA growth will definitely outpace revenue growth. And I think the way we're going to do that, it's kind of what we've been talking about since the beginning of this year, which is that since late 2022 through now, we've taken share through continued investment and improvements in the core recipe which is price selection, speed and availability, but then what we've been able to do this year is augment that with the two other pillars of growth that we've historically had through the bulk of our 20-plus year history, which is that we always improve the recipe, which is that core consumer value proposition, but then we augmented that with the second pillar, which was really about new programs and innovation.

So some examples of what's been added over the last year and is really scaling is, for example, what we're doing in physical retail stores, our loyalty program, Wayfair Rewards, what we're doing with our editorial program, Wayfair Verified. Those are three notable examples, but there's a long list. And then the third pillar, and the third pillar is that we have a technology organization of around 2,500 people. And these are software engineers, data scientists, applied science folks, product managers, designers. And these folks, generally, the bulk of their effort is focused on improving the customer and the supplier experience, which drives up conversion, drives up traffic, allow suppliers to do more for customers. It compounds through repeat gains.

And what we did for the last 2, 3 years since 2022 is we spent a couple of years working on reshaping our organizational model so that we could be lean and focused and execute well, but we also spent about 3 years on a very large technology replatforming effort for almost all of our core systems. And as we've gotten substantially through that by the end of last year, we've then seen the technology cycles return to driving the business forward.

So that's part of why we're able to launch all the new programs I mentioned in the second pillar, and it's also contributing a lot to the experience, which is the third pillar. So when you take those three pillars of growth, you see how they provide this compounding benefit. You can then see how we've been gaining momentum through this year, and you can see how it should go into next year, you'll see further top line growth, further bottom line growth, and you'll see EBITDA growth outpace revenue growth.

Fiona Tan
Chief Technology Officer

Jolie, I want to touch on your question around how to think about the gross margin, and the ACNR for next year because I think that speaks to a really important point that we spoke about a little bit in the prepared remarks, which is thinking about that contribution margin. So the gross margin less the customer service and merchant fees, less the marketing expense gets us to that contribution margin. Obviously, it's been sort of 15%-ish plus over the last few quarters. And we increasingly think that's a thoughtful way to sort of look at the business, right? We want to make sure that, that contribution margin is in a very healthy place.

And then the flow-through to EBITDA is really strong because that SOT G&A line below that is holding relatively constant. So as you think about that contribution margin staying healthy and that could be some interplay between gross margin and marketing spend and then the flow through being quite strong, that's how that EBITDA dollar growth is really outpacing that top line growth. And we're very focused on the EBITDA dollar growth continuing.

Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.

Simeon Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I want to first ask about sales, a little follow-up to the prior question. So your top line is running in a place where I think it aligns with the slide deck that you put out, I think, in 2022, mid- to high single digits, if not maybe close to that. Do you think the business is now at this inflection point where it continues to grow in that level? You said it was past some certain technology investments. I realize you can't control what the industry does, but it feels like you've gotten past a bunch of bumps or tough compares plus industry normalizing. So do you think we've gotten past this inflection point?

Niraj Shah
Co-Founder, Co-Chairman & CEO

Yes. So I'm not 100% sure what you're referring to. I think you might be referring to the Analyst Day that we had in the summer a little over 2 years ago, in the summer of '23 and August '23. There, I think we were talking about kind of the long-term potential of the business, and we provided a view as to how the revenue growth could be kind of meaningfully into the double digits. But when you think about our different lines of business and the initiatives we had and the potential and then getting past the technology replatforming, et cetera, and that we're still very bullish on how this compounding benefit will continue to accrue and when our momentum will climb. And then we also give a view on EBITDA growth and how that could grow over time and get meaningfully into the double digits as well.

And you're seeing that play out as we go through time. And we think a lot of benefits are still ahead of us as we get the benefits of volume, as we continue to deploy technology, et cetera. So I would say we feel very good about the direction we're on from that meeting we had 2 years ago.

Kate Gulliver
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Yes. I think I'd maybe add to that. I think what you're seeing here is share gains, as Niraj spoke about, that are compounding frankly because of the initiatives that we started a year plus ago. So things like the replatforming being completed and tech advancements that Niraj spoke to our loyalty program, Wayfair Verified, over time, you'll physical retail. And so you're seeing that ongoing momentum. Obviously, there's a macro context that we're operating in, and we think the category itself right now is flat to slightly down, but that macro context could move things around on the top line.

Simeon Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And then a quick follow-up. Any predictions -- if paid search moves more towards agentic, how does that change the advertising line? Is this something you can think about? Is there visibility on this? Or it's just theoretical at this point?

Niraj Shah
Co-Founder, Co-Chairman & CEO

Well, I think we can both think about it and it is theoretical at this point. So I'll give you some thoughts, but it's very, very early, right? And so I think the way to think about it is so there's no question that the use of the chatbot is growing quite quickly. And you could see how search will then evolve, and whether it's the search interfaces become -- that exist today like a Google search becomes more agentic or whether it's that chatbots become a new way to search, there's different things, and they could all emerge into whatever that new version is.

At the end of the day, the goal historically of search was to show the best answers to questions. And the goal of these agents is to help you find the best answers to your questions. And it's just a different way of doing it, trying to get you closer to answers that help you. Ultimately, if Wayfair is providing the best offerings and provides the best solutions for people, we're going to surface really well. Ultimately, whoever are the media owners of those properties, there's probably a high chance they're also going to monetize them through advertising, right? And so I tend to think that paid search may turn into a different form of paid services and organic search will turn into a new surface of how organic answers are provided.

We've had a long history of being a great partner to all the media properties, whether you think about Google, or you're thinking about Meta, or you're thinking about Pinterest and the list goes on, codeveloping products with them, being an early tester of them, being very optimized for them in the early days. And so the work we're doing with the various AI chat LLM companies is no different, and we're working with a number of them very closely, and that's part of the benefit of having a 2,500-person technology organization and being very technology-oriented, and how we think about how we approach the business and being led by folks who are definitely closer described to being engineers than merchants.

Your next question comes from Peter Keith with Piper Sandler.

Peter Keith
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Great results, guys. So clearly, there's some share gains happening with your business, but it does seem like the industry backdrop is getting better, which I think is surprising to some investors given a sluggish housing market and tariffs. So Niraj, I was wondering if you could just opine on the industry backdrop, if you think it's getting better and, if so, why and perhaps maybe there's some type of replacement cycle that's already starting up.

Niraj Shah
Co-Founder, Co-Chairman & CEO

Yes, sure. So I guess I think the way to think about it, I think, is that the industry backdrop is getting better and a different way to say that is, it is no longer getting worse at a fast rate, right? And so if you think about kind of multiple years of double-digit declines, that means that you've kind of come pretty far off of where you were. And if you take the trend back to pre-COVID, we're quite far off what the trend -- the long-term trend had been. Now what's happening now? Well, it's no longer declining at that type of rate, right? We think it's more like flattish.

So one way to describe that is that it came off perhaps you would call high, it broke trend. And then it basically has kind of "bottomed out" or it's in a low -- a depressed low of some sort. And once you're at that depressed low, things like the replacement cycle, folks who move still for whatever reason, the degree that household formation is still happening, those things are still going to cause people purchasing items. So it's not like the lowest where you purchase 0 in the category.

But then it is, there are cycles, and you're seeing that. Every quarter that goes by, the percent of mortgages below 4% ticks down because some amount of folks refinance to a new mortgage because there is a reason to move. There is a reason to sell their house. There is something that overwhelms the fact that perhaps at a low-cost mortgage and they're going to end up with a high cost margin. So it's happening, it's just happening slowly. And so I do think when you look forward, you're going to see that housing is at a low right now existing home sales. It will end up higher. You'll see that the purchasing in the category will end up higher. And we do think there's kind of a long-term trend that probably, most things revert to the mean over some period of time, and it will probably revert to the mean over some period of time.

So I think that's where you can see that it will get better. It's just less clear that it's an acute upturn. And that's why we took some time this morning in the comments to try to clarify the strategy we have and the way in which we have the compounding gains and the compounding share gains and the compounding benefits to growth and even more to EBITDA is really around things we control. So some folks refer to that as self-help, but basically improving the recipe is something we can do, launching new programs, innovation, growing those is something we can do. Investing our technology efforts into improving the customer-supplier experience is something we can do. And so we think that is how we had only $12-ish billion in revenue out of $500 billion in the TAM, have a lot of room to take share and grow even while the category is more anemic. And as the category gets more energy into it, we would expect that to accrue to even more benefits to growth.

Peter Keith
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. That's very helpful. I guess I had a follow-up question, too, from a topic that's been kind of ongoing during the quarter, which was that Amazon had stopped advertising through Google Shopping early in Q3. And I guess I'm wondering if you think this provided any benefit to sales or maybe ad leverage during the quarter?

Niraj Shah
Co-Founder, Co-Chairman & CEO

Yes. So Amazon, they for a certain period, cut their spending in a certain channel in half. Then they came back in, and then they took spending down entirely. Then they came back in certain countries. And so they've done various things, probably different versions of testing what it's worth to them and the like. Most advertisers that do hold out tests. We mentioned that we just did some recently of some large-scale. Just you want to make sure that your advertising is productive and incremental and paying off in the way that you would need it to want to continue.

That does not -- what they did does not have a very big impact on us at all. And the reason is just that where they're advertising, when you think about the pockets that we specialize in, we're a very significant player already. So what happens is when you think about who surfaces on these paid services, and the auction, there's always multiple folks. And if you're already at a pretty high share. It doesn't really matter whether someone else comes in or out, they just get replaced by someone else. And it doesn't necessarily make sense for you to take more share because you're already purchasing the optimal amount of share that is worth to you.

And the places where they may advertise where it's less relevant to you, you're not going to go advertise there anyways even if the price went very close to 0, because it doesn't benefit you. It's not something that you participate in, not a category you sell in or where your offering makes sense to advertise. So the net effect is, I'm sure, for some folks who maybe were just under them in share who -- Amazon's bidding price was such that, all of a sudden, the inventory opened up and they're the next person who could grab it, it would benefit them. But that's going to be very narrow and who it would help. And in our case, given our specialist nature and where we focus and the degree of share we have there, it didn't really have an impact on us.

Kate Gulliver
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Yes. Peter, to your question around the sort of what drove the ad spend leverage in the quarter, I would think about it as a few folds. First, we are seeing nice gains in free traffic. We've talked about that. I mentioned in the prepared remarks, increased downloads, frankly, of the app and app usage, which is an area that we've been driving for some time. And then there are some onetime benefits because of our own holdout test this quarter. And so when you think about the sort of efficiency beyond that general 11% to 12% range, some of that was certainly driven by the holdout testing that we do. We think that's quite important frankly to ensure the efficacy of our modeling. But I would think about that in general. Yes, and those are onetime in nature.

Your next question comes from Maria Ripps with Canaccord.

Maria Ripps
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. First, can you maybe give us a little bit more color on what drove sort of revenue acceleration in the later part of the quarter? Is there anything sort of worth highlighting in terms of performance by brand or consumer income levels? And can you quantify the impact have been of this pull forward to Q3?

Kate Gulliver
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Maybe I'll just start on sort of revenue and then, Niraj, you can jump in. So we don't typically disclose revenue by month or within the quarter. In general, revenue growth has been aided by all of these factors that we've been speaking to, which has been really the compounding share gains from initiatives that have been begun over a year ago, so Wayfair Verified, the loyalty program, the improvements to the site experience from the replatforming, and we're seeing that continue to build momentum.

As it relates specifically to brands and income, we are seeing strength in the sort of higher-end brands. That's been for quite some time. So Perigold, which is our luxury brand, and then the specialty retail brands, those all operate at a higher average order value, higher price point, has seen some really nice strength, which I think is consistent with what others have seen from consumers that, that higher income consumer has held in a bit better.

Niraj Shah
Co-Founder, Co-Chairman & CEO

Yes. And what I would say, the strength we're seeing overall comes from the structural business initiatives we have, not pull forward. So -- and we're continuing to see good momentum on the structural business initiatives, and it's just -- and those are things we control. So I wouldn't think of a pull forward being -- playing a role into how the quarter played out.

Maria Ripps
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

Got it. That's very helpful. And then just to follow-up on agentic shopping, and I appreciate all the color there. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color on how sort of agentic shopping for the furniture vertical could be different from shopping across maybe like other simpler items? And can you maybe give us a little bit more specifics in terms of how you're optimizing your platform and listings for organic chatbot search results?

Niraj Shah
Co-Founder, Co-Chairman & CEO

Yes. So great. Maybe, I'll let Fiona share some thoughts and then I'll add anything that maybe -- as well. Fiona, do you want to share any thoughts?

Fiona Tan
Chief Technology Officer

Yes. So certainly, I think for agentic shopping, one of the things that is a little bit different for us in the home category is the fact that it is a more complex category. We've got high consideration items and very complex delivery promises. So one thing we want to make sure that we get right is the foundational first-party truth as to make sure that our catalog, pricing fulfillment is perfectly integrated, and that's the critical first step. And we're working on that actively with all the partners that I mentioned earlier, the AI platforms. And then we also make -- want to make sure that once customers are able to discover our products also that they're able to transact, so something that we are also working on with the partners.

Niraj Shah
Co-Founder, Co-Chairman & CEO

Yes. And I think, Maria, one thing we've always found is that -- and this goes back to even back to the search days when you think about platforms like Google, Pinterest and Meta, but certainly be true today. This is a category -- it's not a UPC code commodity-driven category where you can specify what you need. And then a lot of the purchasing is replenishment purchasing, where you continue to buy the same items over time, and you want them deliver to you perhaps or maybe pick them up. But either way, you kind of know exactly what you want. And so product discovery is something that is, I think, is unique in our category. And so customers do have a lot of zeal to understand what's available, what styles are developing, what's changing in trends.

So I do think in the agentic world, there's a lot one can do with customers to help them, with whether it's product visualization, taking their room and showing them images of what it could be. And I think there's things that can happen on these AI chatbots in there. But I think there's a lot we can also do on our own platform with customers, particularly with all the data we have about them. And I think what you'll find is that there are certain things that may start more upper funnel and as they move lower funnel and maybe different experiences they need that are helpful as the product discovery, product education, nuanced decision-making all occurs.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.

Brian Nagel
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Congrats on a nice quarter. So the first question I want to ask, just with regard to -- it's a bit repetitive, but with regard to gross margin, in the commentary this quarter and then, I guess, just recently about the focus now on contribution margin. Is there a philosophical change happening as you're thinking about gross margin? Or are you seeing a lever within that line item now that you're increasingly likely to pull in order to drive a better outcome?

Niraj Shah
Co-Founder, Co-Chairman & CEO

Let me -- I'll just say one thing, and I'll turn it over to Kate to answer your question. I would say we're very focused on the long-term potential of the business, the long-term profitability of the business. And so if you think about long-term, how do we maximize EBITDA? There's multiple ways to maximize EBITDA. Margin rate is one feature. Revenue volume is another feature. And obviously, if you multiply these things by each other, you then end up with the EBITDA dollars, or we can talk about free cash flow dollars. Ultimately, we care about the owner's earnings dollars, which is really the thing we're trying to optimize, which is where we do think of the stock-based compensation is a real cost.

And so the owner's earnings dollars, which is what we care about, we're going to optimize. And we're going to do that by both growing, by managing costs well, and there's an interplay between the two. Now to answer your question more precisely from a financial modeling standpoint, let me turn it over to Kate.

Kate Gulliver
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Yes. I think, Niraj articulated actually the philosophy and the philosophy that's been consistent for some time, right, which is ultimately what we're focused on is adjusted EBITDA dollars growth on this multi-quarter view. Perhaps what you're hearing from us is we're trying to do a better job of articulating how that happens and the components there.

So if we go to contribution margin, again, that's the gross margin less the CS&M, less the ACNR. That contribution margin, we are also focused on optimizing contribution margin dollars on this multi-quarter view and how do we manage the levers that make up contribution margin to get to that point. As we think about those, the variable cost components that sort of drive that contribution margin, we are constantly testing what is the sort of optimum mix and what works best, again, with this multi-quarter dollars view, right?

And so to the specific question on gross margin, for the last many quarters, the optimal place to be, has sort of been between the 30% and 31% range, closer to 30%, as you all have noticed. And that's been the right place again to optimize multi-quarter contribution margin dollars and then, obviously, multi-quarter adjusted EBITDA dollars because as we think about having that fixed cost piece of that SOT G&A controls, as we grow those contribution margin dollars, that flow-through to adjusted EBITDA dollars, you're seeing that these last several quarters is quite nice. So again, not a philosophical shift, but hopefully a better articulation of how we're managing it.

Brian Nagel
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

No, that's really helpful. I appreciate all the color. My follow-up question, look, I appreciate all the discussion today on gen AI and how Wayfair is employing the technology, and nice to meet you over the phone, Fiona. So I guess the question, I don't want to go too short term on this, but clearly, Wayfair, there's an improving market share dynamic here we've seen. The question is, as you -- is Gen AI helping that? Or -- and I guess maybe another way to ask it, from an investment standpoint, what should we be watching for in Wayfair results to basically say, look, here's a company that truly is using gen AI to break away from the pack?

Niraj Shah
Co-Founder, Co-Chairman & CEO

Yes. So one thing I would say to that, Brian. So if you think about the potential of what you can do with gen AI, it's quite substantial, but like if you think about like a baseball game, last night went 18 innings, but say it normally goes 9 innings, you'd still say we're in like the first inning of what you can do. Now, I think what we're doing is meaningfully out ahead of most retailers, but what we're doing is still very early days compared to what we think the potential is. And so the bulk of the gains are definitely yet to come.

And in terms of the market share dynamic, in terms of us gaining market share, meaning looking backwards over what's happened over this year so far over the last couple of years, gen AI would not have played a very big role in that. But what we're working on and deploying, we're very excited about, and we can see the trajectory of what it's doing. And so we think it will become meaningful over time, but this is just the latest in what's been an ongoing evolution of technologies. We've been using machine learning for a decade or longer, and there's a lot -- we've always done with technology, that's very helpful.

And I think basically, it's hard not to be excited about the potential of gen AI. And I do think you will see some companies be much more adept at using it in a way that's differentiated and faster than others. And so I do think it is yet the latest in something that will separate some from others through technology and the use of.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities.

Steven Forbes
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Niraj, maybe changing topics to the multichannel fulfillment offering, curious if you could just expand on the general receptivity from their supplier network. Any comments on how you expect the offering to mature? And just how fast we should sort of think through CastleGate utilization as that program ramps over the coming years here?

Niraj Shah
Co-Founder, Co-Chairman & CEO

Yes. Yes. Sure, Steve. So on multichannel fulfillment, so we talked about that last quarter. That's a great example. When I talk about the three pillars of growth, I talked about the recipe, the second is programs, and the third was technology. And a lot of the programs are enabled by technology. Multichannel is a great example of another program, right? And so that's something that required technology work for us to create it and launch it.

Obviously, then it's something we execute on our physical operations in our facilities. It's something that adds a lot of value to our suppliers. It helps us with a larger forward position inventory pool for our business. It creates a new revenue stream and margin stream associated with infrastructure we already have. And it's just another way we can be a deeper partner to our suppliers. So it has had many compounding benefits the profitability being one of the benefits, meaning the direct profitability program being one of the benefits, but there's all the other things.

And so suppliers have actually been pretty excited about it. It is optimized for what they care about, meaning that we focus -- we generally sell larger bulkier items. And so our program is optimized for larger bulkier items. Most of the fulfillment services suppliers can use that are out there are optimized for smaller, lighter packages, which is the bulk of packages that ship every day, but not in the home space. And so it's been a great offering for suppliers that they've been excited by. We're seeing them -- they start by trialing it out, and then they like it, they start ramping up and they start growing their usage over time.

And so we feel good about how that's going to go. The fulfillment center infrastructure we have is quite large. And so it's just another way we can leverage it, and use it and get volume into it. In terms of CastleGate penetration, I think we -- Kate, did we give a stat about how it hit kind of an all-time high last quarter?

Kate Gulliver
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Yes. We said last quarter, there was roughly 25%. We give that stat from time to time. But I just -- sort of stepping back on that, you are seeing nice momentum there. And that's certainly, obviously, helping as we think about improving that customer offering and getting it tour as fast and as efficiently as possible.

Niraj Shah
Co-Founder, Co-Chairman & CEO

Yes. And just to be clear, that 25% number is the percent of our order volume that ships out of CastleGate facility, not the percent of our fulfillment centers that are utilized. I think I've seen sometimes confusion on that. So just to clarify.

Steven Forbes
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Maybe just a quick follow-up. You talked about the replatforming in the shareholder letter earlier this year. I don't know if you could just maybe speak to how you would sort of qualify the benefits of moving past that, how they're trending relative to expectations and if any sort of new opportunities have emerged as you sort of plan for the next couple of years here?

Niraj Shah
Co-Founder, Co-Chairman & CEO

Okay. So yes. So the way to think about it is so we're 23 years old. And what happens is as you build your technology infrastructure and, as I mentioned, we have a thousands of people, so you're building a large technology infrastructure. Your systems, over time, there's a lot of benefit in replatforming them because what can happen -- what will happen with our core systems is that they basically got very intertangled over time. And they weren't built very discretely because when you're smaller, building them discretely just would be much more expensive than undertaking, and you don't get a lot of benefit.

But as you get bigger, the way you could scale is you want them to be discrete and just interface with each other through APIs and other interfaces or published streams of data so that when a team is working on something, they don't need to then go into every other system. They can engage with those systems through published interfaces or easy, simple, clean interfaces. And so what happens as you go through that replatforming is, obviously, it's a very intensive activity and quite expensive from an investment standpoint because you're spending your technology cycles for a long period of time on doing that work.

But what you get out of it is then your developer velocity, your speed of developing new things is dramatically faster. Your ability to preclude kind of errors or issues in the platforms is much higher so the quality goes up, and you can actually also reduce costs. So it's undertaking that we've been very -- sort of it was a necessary thing to do. But now that we're quite far along in it, we're seeing the benefits in terms of our velocity, the things we can launch, the speed at which we can launch them, the ways in which we can use third-party products as well as what we do first party. And so it's been pretty exciting, and we're just -- I'd say there's a lot of gains to come.

But I highlight it because when we talk about the second pillar of new programs or when we just talk about the core supplier and customer experience, those are both highly reliant on technology and the use of technology. And so it's a very market difference that we're now back in a position where we have the technology cycles to invest in this way, versus where we were committing those cycles to the replatforming. So it's just we're in a very different place, and we're seeing the benefits.
