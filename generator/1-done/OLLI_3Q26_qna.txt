[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett.

Charles Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

I was hoping you could frame out the state of your consumer in light of your basket commentary. DG also spoke about some ticket compression during times of consumer duress recently and also historically. And then bigger picture, can you talk about your vendor relationships, both on the closeout front, but more importantly, the steps you're taking to drive deeper CPG relationships?

Eric van der Valk
President, CEO & Director

Sure. Thanks, Chuck. Yes, I'll start with your -- the second part of your question. In terms of relationships, it's been a difficult environment for many traditional retailers with bankruptcy, store closures, disruptions from tariffs. Customers continue to seek value, and we continue to grow our share of the order book of many vendors kind of regardless of the space that they're in. In CPG has certainly been a big component of that. Our food business is an indication of the strength of not only the customer looking for value in products they need, but also a deal flow that has been particularly strong in large part as a result of abandoned product or order book -- space in CPG order books that used to be sold to some of these companies that are no longer around or have consolidated.

So that has been very good for us. It's helped us to open up new relationships as well. You would think at our size and scale that we know everyone, and that's really not true. We still have opportunities to work more directly with various vendors even in the CPG space, and we've been able to open up some new relationships over the past year that have been very meaningful for us, and it's meeting that customer need to buy to get extreme value in product that they need. In terms of the state of the consumer, we're seeing that the strength -- we're seeing strength in the higher income consumer above $100,000 in household income. Strength in upper middle, it's $65,000 and above.

It's solid lower middle, and we've seen a little bit of -- I don't know if it's trade out or a little bit of softness in the lower income consumer, which we could potentially attribute to the government shutdown and some of the disruption that happened as a result of that. But we're seeing on the whole that the strength of the upper middle and upper income consumer more than offsets a little bit of the weakness with that lower income consumer and that low middle has been hanging in there. And as we indicated, we've been able to attract a lot more customers and convert them in the loyalty program as well, and we think in part driven by deal flow in CPG product.

Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.

Matthew Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So could you elaborate on the components of the third quarter comp, particularly the growth in transactions maybe relative to the second quarter versus drivers of the basket decline? And just how this fits into your customer acquisition strategy? And separately, could you speak to the cadence of monthly comps that you saw in the third quarter and just help define the strong start that you cited in the fourth quarter, maybe notably trends that you saw before and after Black Friday weekend?

Robert Helm
Executive VP & CFO

Matt, I'll chime in on the first part, and then Eric will take the second part about the customer acquisition. We were very pleased with our comp in the third quarter. The positive 3.3% is above our guidance of the positive 3% for the entire quarter. We saw a mid-single-digit positive transaction trend, which is actually an acceleration off of Q2 when you normalize it for the incremental Ollie's Army Night Event that we added during that quarter. Basket was the piece that was down. That was down low single digits, and that was driven by a decline in AUR that was in the high single digits.

From a cadence perspective, we were pleased with the flow of the quarter. We saw a little bit of slowdown midway through the quarter. It was at a time when unseasonably warm weather and the initial government shutdown took place. So I'm not sure how much is attributable to either component. But we saw momentum return in October when the weather changed. We exited the quarter with very strong momentum. That momentum has carried into November. Quarter-to-date trends are currently running ahead of our guidance. And that AUR that was a high single-digit decline is now a positive low single-digit increase to our AUR. So all in all, between the assortment and where we're running from a momentum perspective, we feel very confident to deliver our guidance in the fourth quarter and deliver the year.

Eric van der Valk
President, CEO & Director

Matt, I'll just add a little bit of color on AUR. We really don't overtly manage AUR at Ollie's. We manage price gaps. We saw an opportunity in Q3, and it speaks a little bit to Chuck's question about CPG and strength in CPG. We saw an opportunity to invest in price, especially in consumables. We also had opportunities to buy some very compelling low AUR deals in craft and seasonal in a couple of other categories. And we took the opportunity to invest in lower AUR deals that we believe customers would respond very favorably to, and they did, and that really drove our traffic over the course of Q3. It also made us a lot of friends and it helps us to win hearts and minds and helps us to win loyal customers that will be customers for life. So we like this investment in price. We like this investment in low AUR. We're in this for the long haul in terms of customer acquisition and retention, and we were very happy with the outcome.

Our next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone from Citi.

Steven Zaccone
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I wanted to follow up there. The customer acquisition trends, can you talk about the growth you're seeing with new customers and then overall customer retention? And then as it relates to the Ollie's Army Night in December, how is your planning for that event changed at all based on the learnings from adding an additional night in June this year?

Eric van der Valk
President, CEO & Director

Sure. Thanks, Steve. In terms of customer acquisition, very happy, one of the strongest from an acquisition standpoint, we've ever experienced as a company. Our retention is also very good. Customer reactivations are also strong. So we're hitting on all cylinders in terms of Ollie's Army. Acquisition remains a key focus. It's product, newness, brands, new brands, great pricing, the investing in price that we've done. It improved store experience. The digital marketing, we believe, also is helping to drive a new customer into our stores.

We're seeing -- in terms of the makeup of new customers that were acquired to the Army, we're seeing a younger customer. Our strongest cohort was 18 to 34 years old, which was -- which really blew us away because typically, it's more in the mid-30s to mid-40s. That was our second strongest cohort from an acquisition standpoint, was 35 to 44. And then from an income standpoint, I commented a little bit when Matt asked his question, but upper middle and higher income were the strongest in terms of acquisition of the Army.

In terms of Ollie's Army Night, I kind of made the comment on the call about our learning from the summer event. We had such an enthusiastic response from customers about the earlier start time of the event. If you remember, we started -- we started the event at 5:00 p.m. So we made an adjustment, given the time of the year and the weather in a lot of places to start this event at 4:00 p.m. The event is actually 1 hour longer runs until 9:00.

Many of the customers that commented favorably about the earlier start time in June were older customers, are the kind of customers like the dinner at 5:30 and watch Jeopardy at 7:00. That's a shout out to my 84-year-old dad because that's him, but he -- that's the customer that appreciates the earlier start time. In terms of how we're thinking about it, we're not actually thinking about the outcome any differently. Currently, it's all accounted for in our guidance. And so we're not banking on any significant incremental contribution from the day itself.

Our next question comes from the line of Brad Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Bradley Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

You did a nice job here of driving leverage even with such a large increase in stores here this quarter. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about some of the levers that you're pulling in SG&A and perhaps an early look at how to think about that into next year.

Robert Helm
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. I'll take that question. It's Rob. We have an incredible white space opportunity ahead. We have a predictable, portable and profitable model that's unlike anything else in the marketplace. The model itself generates an incredible amount of free cash flow, and its unique operating model that can be scaled over time. Our focus is really positioning the business not for next year, but for the next 5 to 10 years to deliver consistent sales and earnings growth over time. But to your point, we're also focused on delivering near-term results. Thinking ahead to 2026, we anticipate benefiting from the full year annualization of the step change in the new stores that we opened.

We expect to benefit from a favorable real estate environment, setting up another year of strong and elevated growth. Our new store openings being front-loaded for next year is also a positive. And we also should have the roll-off of the dark rent that we incurred for the Big Lots locations that we acquired. At the same time, we're going to continue to reinvest in the business to support growth and do face some cost pressures like medical, which are still remain at elevated levels. But what that means for earnings in 2026 is we will be able to leverage this business, leverage the SG&A, assuming no radical changes in the environment and drive double-digit top line growth with mid-teens bottom line growth.

Eric van der Valk
President, CEO & Director

Maybe I could just comment on the marketing aspect of it because that was a highlight from Q3. As we move forward, I commented in the script a bit that the business has so much potential digital has the ability to reshape how we reach and engage with our customers. And we've been on a multiyear path now to transform our marketing to be much more digital first, applying data analytics to ensure we get the right return out of our marketing spend, especially in the digital space. We did learn that there is a significant opportunity to reallocate print dollars into digital. It was a [indiscernible] in Q3 on a go-forward basis to the point of your question, Brad, how do we look at this in future years? It's more of a reallocation of print into digital.

The reallocation in Q3 specifically was cutting postcards from nonresponders. So those are solo mail delivered postcards, and we virtually saw no impact. October was the best performing month, and that's the month in which we cut the postcards. So longer term, we're looking at continuing that transformation, accelerating the movement out of print and linear media into digital, which should be great for driving top line. We don't look at it as necessarily an SG&A opportunity.

Our next question comes from the line of Sarah Morin from Piper Sandler.

Sarah Morin
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

This is Sarah on for Peter. What kind of opportunities do you see to improve sales productivity? And then how are you thinking about ability to optimize category mix? And then as you do lean more into consumables, I'm wondering what does this imply for the longer-term gross margin? Is 40% still kind of that right target?

Eric van der Valk
President, CEO & Director

Sure, Sarah. I'll take the first part of your question. Rob will take the consumable mix impact to gross margin. Closeouts are the lifeblood of our business, and we still look at it as the most important way in which we demonstrate and deliver value to our customer. As we continue to grow, though, we're seeing opportunities to leverage our size and scale to more overtly steer our category mix, whether that's steering our closeout mix into new brands, new vendors, new categories or emphasizing categories, we're much more in the driver seat than we've been in the past.

Given the sheer amount of product that's being presented to us on an ongoing basis, given our size and scale, the most challenging decisions we have to make is what not to buy, and that's becoming more and more challenging as we continue to move forward. A good example of this in Q3 is that we were able to drive consumer staples, including our food category to a new level, which we'll get to your question about impact on gross margin, we're seeing that we are one of the few buyers out there of substance in that business, the closeout excess inventory space for CPG. Seasonal was the other example where we were -- we steered our category mix to have much more emphasis on seasonal. So we're going to continue steering as we move into future years and maximizing our sales productivity as we go forward.

Robert Helm
Executive VP & CFO

So let me touch on the gross margin for a moment. Our guidance of 40.3% is above our long-term algo of 40%. We have quite a number of tailwinds within gross margin this year. The first one to speak to is really our size and scale in the closeout environment, which has been quite good. Markdowns and shrink has also been lower, and that's been offset to some degree by higher supply chain costs and tariff expenses. We have -- we're not giving guidance for 2026 today, and that's something we'll give in a couple of months.

But what I would say broadly about gross margin is we manage this business, as Eric said, to price gaps to the fancy stores. Our price gaps have extended at a time that we've also expanded margins. So that feels quite good, but we do have a flexible buying model where if we can't be the lowest price in the market and we can't have that wide of a price gap, we simply won't buy the item, and we'll move on to the next item.

Our next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.

Mary Smart

This is [ Mary Smart ] on for Lorraine. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing from your new stores? Are they still performing ahead of expectations, particularly those in bankruptcy locations? And then also, you talked a little bit in the past about making changes to more of a soft opening versus a grand opening, especially for the new stores in bankruptcy locations. Is there any update on how the soft openings are going? And is that a strategy that you expect to continue to employ moving forward?

Robert Helm
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. This is Rob. I'll take this question. New store performance has been extremely strong. We've been essentially beat plan across 85% of the stores that we've opened this year. So we're very pleased with that. With respect to the "reverse waterfall" that we've had historically, we are now getting our first looks at the comping stores when we really started that exercise of soft opening versus grand opening with the 99 Cents Only Stores in the fall of 2024. So far, what we're seeing in results is that the reverse waterfall has flattened quite a bit. So the second year typically in our model was a comp decline, and we're seeing that second year for those 99 Cents Only Stores certainly being much flatter, which bodes for a flatter comp in years 3 and 4 as well.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from Truist.

Joshua Young
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

This is Joshua on for Scot. So could you just give us an update on the performance you're seeing from your stores that are in a similar market to the now closed Big Lots locations? And then as we think about new stores and you've kind of accelerated the pace of openings here, has there been any operational stresses you've had to work through whether that might be supply chain or labor, anything to call out there?

Robert Helm
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. I'll take the first part with Big Lots. I think Eric can take the second part with the operations. We're excited about the performance we're seeing where the Bigs have closed. These stores continue to outperform the rest of the chain. The best performers are roughly the, call it, 290 stores within 5 miles of a Big Lots closure where it has not reopened. Those stores remain to be running low single digit -- between low single-digit and mid-single-digit lift versus the rest of the chain. The, call it, 110 locations where Big Lots closed and then a variety of wholesalers reopened the stores, we're roughly seeing the same trends there and maybe a tick lower, but still better performance than the balance of the chain.

Eric van der Valk
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Joshua, I'll take the second part of your question. I think dovetailing on to the first part of your question, the question asked earlier about soft openings and reverse waterfall that we went into this year not only investing in infrastructure, supply chain infrastructure, project management teams, real estate, store development, the construction teams, the store leadership teams to ensure that we could grow at this accelerated pace. But we also went into this year with the soft open approach, which takes some of the stress out of the process in that with the hard opening dates, you centered all of your efforts around hitting this one exact date, and it results in a lot of extraordinary.

What we call it Ollie's muscle through it type moments where the teams get pushed to their limit and they become exhausted. We also paced our openings out over the course of the first 3 quarters so that we weren't opening too many stores in any given week, which allowed us to spread our resources out across the fleet. And it allowed us to successfully deliver the 86 stores. We're tired. It was a tremendous effort for the team. So I'm not indifferent to what it took to accomplish this, but we went in with a plan. We executed the plan and it worked out well, successful. We're ready to do it again for 2026.

Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Chukumba from Loop Capital Markets.

Anthony Chukumba
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

So you talked in your prepared remarks about the fact that you have this increased seasonal merchandise assortment as well as an expanded holiday gift program. If I remember correctly, last year, a lot of the holiday gifts were essentially a closeout from Big Lots. But I'm assuming -- and correct me if I'm wrong, but with a lot of the seasonal gift, it's direct sourced from Asia. I guess, first off, let me know if that's correct or not. And then also just what are the margin implications of direct sourcing with the seasonal and the holiday gift as opposed to close out?

Eric van der Valk
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Anthony. The seasonal gifts are a combination of direct source and closeout. To your point, though, they tend to be a little bit more direct source depending on the category, especially true of seasonal. We were fortunate this year to have the ability to buy closeouts in seasonal as a result of some of the retail bankruptcies and some of the store closures. So we had more closeouts as a percentage of our seasonal assortment than we typically see. Yes, but a lot of it is direct source. Gifts, you're remembering a specific closeout we bought last year that was kind of stocking stuffer-oriented gifts. That's true. There's a combination of produced for us and closeouts in gifts tends to be a little bit more produced. What we're seeing with our continued increase in -- as we've accelerated our growth and our continued increase in size and scale and leverage, we are able to buy this product at an even better margin. And it's not a headwind.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Carden from UBS.

Mark Carden
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So building on your marketing spend commentary on the dollar shift from print to digital, you noted you cut on some of the post cards. How are you thinking about the traditional print flyers role going forward in your advertising strategy? And would you expect to make any incremental changes on that front in the coming quarters?

Eric van der Valk
President, CEO & Director

We still do believe in the flyer events. How we deliver the message to the customer is where we'll continue to evolve. We primarily use shared mail for the print piece, but that flyer is also distributed in various digital channels, and we get a tremendous amount of engagement from those traditional channels around our digital channels around the -- those flyer events. So we're still flyer event-driven. We're less print delivered flyer event-driven. We'll continue to shift dollars away from print into digital to ensure that the message gets out there to our customers and we continue to drive these events.

We'll shift at a somewhat accelerated pace given we have a tremendous amount of data, and we've learned a lot over the last couple of years about digital, and we'll make smart decisions about ensuring that our flyers still get the exposure, but we're using a more form of media that's going to reach more people long term. I call print, especially for shared mail, it's the kind of the inevitable decline of print media. Like ultimately, it's declining whether we like it or not. So we need to get -- make sure we stay ahead of that.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.

Lauren Ng
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

This is Lauren Ng on for Simeon. First, can you maybe walk through your expectations for the Q4 comp? You mentioned quarter-to-date trends are currently ahead of the guide. So maybe how should we think about this in the context of Q4? And maybe what's driving your expectations for this acceleration? And then quickly, just following up on gross margins. Are you able to help us size the impact of the tariff-related expenses on the Q3? And it looks like the Q4 gross margin contracts pretty meaningfully year-over-year. Is this primarily driven by the tariff impacts?

Robert Helm
Executive VP & CFO

Well, I'll try to address that question, but I think it was 6 parts. So if I forget part, let me know. From a comp perspective, I just want to clarify, we did not say that comps needed to accelerate to meet the guidance. We said that comps are currently running ahead of our guidance quarter-to-date. What gives us confidence in delivering that for the balance of the quarter is our strength in our transaction trends, which we've seen in the mid-single digits pretty much for all of the year this year as well as the complexion step change in our AUR, which is now positive low single digits versus a negative high single digits in the third quarter.

In terms of gross margin for fourth quarter, we'd always planned the gross margin to be in the mid-39% range. That's kind of how we think about the fourth quarter historically. We do have a number of tailwinds this year in gross margin that I outlined between lower markdown rates, benefits from shrink, our ability to follow other retailers with price gaps and take price on tariff-impacted products. So all in all, we feel good in delivering the fourth quarter gross margin. We're just always going to be conservative so that we position our guidance that we can deliver to our shareholders, but we can also take the necessary actions that we need to manage our business and deliver to our customers.

Our next question comes from the line of Ed Kelly from Wells Fargo.

Edward Kelly
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I was curious as to maybe just some early thoughts on the 2026 comp build. And I'm kind of thinking about it in the context of the big tailwind, which obviously you are benefiting from or taking advantage of that for some stores, does that normalize next year? Then as we think about the Big Lot -- the store openings from this year, which many of them were Big Lot conversions, do they act like the 99 Cents Only Stores, meaning flattish or low-ish comp in year 1? And then when you pull all that together, does that basically kind of mean that the highest probability outcome or way to start would be your traditional sort of like 1% to 2% comp guide? And then how do you think about like opportunity associated with that? Obviously, there's some fiscal stuff coming next year with tax cuts. And I'm curious as to how you think that might play out for you?

Robert Helm
Executive VP & CFO

Ed, this is Rob. I'll take that question. So listening to your question, and you answered it for me with a positive 1% to 2%. I was giggling a little bit when I was thinking about it. So from a comp guidance perspective for next year, we'll likely stay on algo. We like the beauty of the algo. It's how we manage our business. It's how we set our cost structure each year. But it's not lost on us that there are tailwinds, potential tailwinds to the comp guidance for next year. I think the potential for elevated tax money in the first half of the year is certainly a piece of it. Big Lots market share capture should be the gift that keeps giving. And we'd expect for that to be a multiyear share capture. AUR, which was a drag this year, potentially, we don't see those types of drags from year-to-year. So I think all in all, there's a number of factors to be positive about next year's comp guidance. But like you said in your question, we'll reset at the positive 1% to 2%, and then we'll seek to deliver from there. And you know what we say, we don't turn the registers off.

Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs.

Unknown Analyst

This is [indiscernible] on for Kate McShane. For the 2026 pipeline of 75 stores, could you maybe expand more on the drivers behind this? And any color on the new store pipeline, like maybe anything you're doing differently? And what are you seeing in the real estate environment and unit growth longer term?

Eric van der Valk
President, CEO & Director

Sure. Yes, we are guiding to 75 stores. We -- opening new stores remains our highest and best use of capital and the investments that we made in accelerating growth really paid off. We're pleased with how we executed getting to the 86 stores this year and the front-loading that we've been able to achieve of getting all the stores open by end of Q3, opening on budget, outperforming projections, et cetera. When we look at the environment moving into 2026, there's enough real estate to fuel growth, that the 75 is already set. We have the deals, most leases signed. There is still vacancy out there from all of the distressed retailers and bankrupt retailers that have gone out, including a disproportionate number of Big Lots vacancies that weren't available or were available to purchase, but not purchased it as part of the bankruptcy auction process that were then available for us to pick up on the open market.

So a disproportionate number of the 75 are Big Lots stores, which we like a lot because those Big Lot stores, what we call warm boxes because they have a discount customer who was just shopping in that store literally 5 minutes ago, we reopened as an Ollie's. We've seen a lot of success over the past year with those stores. So we feel very good about the 75, and we'll continue to evaluate based on opportunities that are in the market and not seeking to extend past the 75. We feel like it's the right number at this point when we balance our accelerated growth with other strategic priorities that we have in place for 2026, but it's a very respectful number on 75.

Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Hamblin from Craig-Hallum Capital Group.

Jeremy Hamblin
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

Congrats on the sustained momentum. I wanted to just come back to the unit openings and get a sense, Rob, for what you're expecting in terms of preopening expense next year, given kind of the impacts of dark rent this year and the timing that you're suggesting with a bit more in the front half of the year than the back half of the year. That's kind of part one. And then two is just in terms of the DC expansions that you're looking at -- in looking at the Illinois facility next year, what type of impact do you see on margins, if any, related to those efforts?

Robert Helm
Executive VP & CFO

I'll take both of those actually. So from a preopening perspective, I think the easiest way to think about it was we had $5 million of Big Lots dark rent in this year. When we acquired those stores, we're on the clock immediately. And so you subtract that out and then flex the preopening expense for the number of unit openings between the 86 and the 75, and you should be able to get reasonably close to where we're going to land the '26 guidance. From a margin perspective, on the expansion, back in the day when we were opening distribution centers and we were smaller with less of a sales base, it was a little bit more of an impact on gross margin in terms of drag when we either open a new distribution center or expanded distribution center. Now that the ship has gotten so big, we'd expect a nominal impact and would anticipate that we would be able to fully offset that through our guidance.

Jeremy Hamblin
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

If I could just one follow-up here on tariffs as well. As we look ahead to next year with the China tariffs being pulled down here by 10 percentage points, would you expect, as we look at kind of holiday season impacts around gross margins to be a bit lower next year if nothing else changes on policy front?

Eric van der Valk
President, CEO & Director

I think, Jeremy, just consider we manage our price gaps. We're a fast follower in terms of price. And the whole world is experiencing the same impact of tariffs, 10% less across the entire industry, other retailers, other importers experience the same. So if they invest in price, adjust their price, lower their price, increase their price according to whichever direction the tariffs may move because there's still a little uncertainty around this at this point as well, then we're a fast follower. We're adjusting price, ensuring that we're maintaining our price gaps. So a long way of saying that I would expect if tariffs go down, eventually the market is adjusting price coming down some, we're coming down some to maintain our price gaps and not expecting it to be some sort of unexpected positive win from a gross margin standpoint in the same way that it wasn't a negative for us as tariffs were increased.
