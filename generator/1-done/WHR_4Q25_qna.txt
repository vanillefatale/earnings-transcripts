Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research.

David S. MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

I guess, Marc, I wanted to start by just unpacking the '26 flat industry units number. And you referenced no expectations for increase in discretionary or builder, which would, I guess, imply a flat replacement demand outlook. But you also, at the same time, talked about seeing strength in replacement demand. So I guess I just wanted to better understand that. And maybe within the context of that answer, you could just talk about the extent to which you're seeing pent-up demand as you had referenced. And then I have a follow-up.

Marc Bitzer
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

Yes. So David, again, as you well know, there's 2 main components of replacement demand, discretionary demand. The replacement demand, what we basically said is continues to stay on a very, very healthy structural level. And that is still on the tail end of post-COVID, we saw a significant higher use of appliance, and that just drives a lot of healthy ongoing replacement demand. As a reminder, as everybody knows, while we like that part of the business, it's not necessarily the most margin accretive part of the business. The discretionary side, and just to be also very clear on the guidance, we have not factored in upside on the discretionary side. The discretionary side would have to largely come from increased remodeling activities and in particular faster or an uptick of existing home sales.

So that is not factored in, even though I think there's a certain chance that depending on what the mortgage rate environment will do, that we will start a slow unfreezing of existing home sales. But again, as a reminder, it's not factored in, in our numbers, in our guidance and as such, could potentially provide an upside. But again, let's just see how that evolves. So far, as you look in the rear mirror in '25, existing home sales were just on a very low level and got stuck there pretty much.

David S. MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

And you had mentioned pent-up demand. I guess just what your assessment is at this point of where that stands? And then I have a follow-up.

Marc Bitzer
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

I mean I think, David, there's a very significant pent-up demand tied towards the housing. And I'm not going to repeat what I think everybody knows. I mean the entire housing market is in terms of new home sales is undersupplied in the tune of 3 million homes. Now that will not happen overnight, but it just means just the new homes will spell a multiyear uptick on demand. The other side is, and this is -- and again, that could potentially materialize earlier. The discretionary side, which comes with remodeling or existing home sales, I think, could accelerate faster than the new homes. And there is significant potential out there, as you know, the consumer has equity, equity in particular in the form of housing stock.

So the perceived equity the consumer has is there, it will take an uptick also in consumer sentiment to unleash that. That, in my view, could happen faster than the new home side. But again, it's right now, we're -- as you all know, we're in a very uncertain global environment. And I would say if consumer sentiment changes, I think you could see an uptick already this year on the discretionary side. But certainly, it's just -- it's only a question of when, it's not if there's a multiyear pent-up demand still waiting out there.

David S. MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

Okay. Great. And then second is a follow-up, I guess, you had a very substantial product refresh in 2025. And along with that, of course, comes elevated flooring costs. What's the benefit in '26 from the relief on the flooring costs to North American market?

Marc Bitzer
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

David, you're highlighting a very important point. Just as a recap and I think many of you listening understand that and know that when you have a lot of new product introductions, and we -- as we highlighted, in particular in North America, we had the highest amount of product introductions in more than a decade. I mean it's been massive. You have, of course -- it starts actually in the factories, you have phase-in and phase-out costs because, of course, you don't run the factory in the most efficient way. If you, at one point, take down production and you ramp it up, you have inefficiencies in there. You have inefficiencies in warehousing inventory because for some period, and you saw that also in Q4, you hold inventory pretty much on phase out and phase in.

And then lastly, you have very significant flooring costs, which just come with flooring with products. Now ultimately, it's like a return on investment. You get your return on the flooring costs, but it all hit our P&L largely in '25. So -- and in particular in the back half, and I'm not trying to take that as an excuse, it's just there, and it was -- it's an investment against the future. So as we turn the page into '26, first of all, you have the absence of these introduction costs, which is an uplift. And second of all, now I have a full benefit of a higher flooring. We know because, of course, we get weekly sell-out numbers. We know the new products are not just floor, they're selling. So we're very pleased with the sell-out. And so not only do you have the absence of a cost, but you also have tailwinds in the form of the demand of the new product. So I don't want to give a precise number how much that means. But of course, that is a very -- beyond a normalization of promotion environment, that's a key driver of where we see the improvement in North America.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.

Michael Rehaut
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

My first question is for Roxanne and Juan Carlos. Congratulations, obviously, stepping into your new roles, your expanded roles and Roxanne, it's a pleasure working with you again. I wanted each of your perspectives on if there's any kind of -- how you're going to approach the jobs over the next couple of years. Obviously, the business has had number of challenges, particularly in the North America margin challenges through various macro, tariff, promotional, et cetera. What's the road back from a margin perspective over the next few years? I mean, obviously, you continue to look at your kind of tried-and-true playbook of cost savings, better mix, et cetera. I know a lot of this is also macro led with the challenges in the existing home repair and remodel market. But I'm wondering if you're looking at anything maybe a little bit bigger picture structural or kind of change in strategy, then that might kind of jump start the pathway back? Or is it going to be more of the initiatives that you've done already and expanding on that?

Roxanne Warner
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Michael. I will answer from a global perspective, and then I will move it over to Juan Carlos. First of all, thanks. It's great working with you again as well. The #1 priority for us continues to be, one, debt paydown, and I will continue to have that focus. Driving that is our continued focus on cash and working capital. You see in 2026, we have a guidance of $400 million to $500 million of free cash flow, and that is imperative that we drive our inventory down. And so that is going to be a #1 focus for us. And then overall, we will continue to deliver on cost takeout as we've done over the years. And absolutely, in 2026, price/mix is going to be absolutely a huge focus, one, on seeing the pricing from an overall industry, but then secondly, delivering on the benefits that Marc just touched on as it relates to our new product launches.

With that, I'll turn it over to JC.

Juan Puente
Executive President of North America & Global Strategic Sourcing

Yes. So thank you very much for the congratulations. I am super happy and excited to be in this new role. Like I mentioned at the beginning, I've been in North America before, and I was part on the -- I would say, in the global financial crisis in 2008, moved in 2008 and then obviously, that happened. So I was together with Marc in that turnaround in 2009, 2010. And not that those tools will be working moving forward, but I think like Roxanne mentioned and we mentioned before, with the new products that we're putting in place, with aggressive cost take actions that we have and obviously, with our manufacturing footprint that is extremely strong in North America, we believe that focusing -- lasering focusing on that, we can turn the business around.

Michael Rehaut
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. No, I appreciate that. I guess, secondly, the sales growth like-for-like of 5%, and it looks like that's against a volume outlook of flat, if I'm understanding the segment -- regional segment guidance, by and large. I guess that, that results in a balance of price and mix driving the growth. I wanted to make sure I'm understanding that right. And how much exactly you're anticipating to come from price versus mix? And lastly, if that 5% also, I would assume applies broadly to the North American segment as well.

Marc Bitzer
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

Michael, it's Marc. First of all, the 5% in North America or globally, the direction is also reflective of what we have in mind in North America. Also on a global level, we showed 1.75 percentage points coming from price/mix. There is a healthy mix portion because we have a lot of new products and premium products, but there is also pricing which comes with a more normalized environment. So what we showed on a global level is also true on a direction on North America level. So yes, there is also in our organic in North America, call it, 2 to 3 points of unit growth in there because we know these new products have been picking up market share, and we expect some carryover into next year. So short answer is there is a portion of price/mix and the price/mix also has a good element of mix in there, but there is also some unit growth into our North America assumptions.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets.

Michael Dahl
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Marc, I was hoping you could touch on or your team could touch on just more specifically the comments around the promotional cadence and then also your own actions around your promotional pricing plans. Can you be more specific or quantitative about what you've seen in recent weeks and how that gives you the better confidence ahead of President's Day, I think quantification would help if you can?

Marc Bitzer
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

So Michael, so let me maybe give you a lot more color on what we've seen in North America up until President's Day. Obviously, I can't comment on the go forward. So first of all, in Q4, in some ways, we've seen two parts of a market in Q4. One was the nonpromotional period where we had the new products in there, where we actually like what we saw, and we picked up market share. The promotion period itself was intense by any definition and I think once the competitors announced their numbers, you will see it was intense. We made a conscious decision to hold our ground during this promotion period. We did not pick up share during the promotion period. But frankly, it was a very costly investment. I mean there's no denial, and you've seen that in our number.

What difference we saw after particular Black Friday and is -- well, was a meaningful difference is post Black Friday, the prices, the promotion prices immediately recovered pretty much exactly the week after. And that is, for those of you following the industry a little bit close, is different from prior years. Very often, you saw that either retailers or competitors did not sell all the products they want Black Friday, prices were extended well, in some cases into January. We did not see that last year. So as intense as the promotion period was, it also ended pretty abruptly. And these higher prices held now for pretty much 6 weeks. Now we all know it's 6 weeks, it's not 52 weeks, but it's 6 weeks, and that is very different from prior year.

We saw a meaningful price change already on MLK. We have, of course, already announced our prices to trade towards President's Day. And what we see is these -- call it, this normalized promotional environment certainly held through President's Day. So we saw a big difference in the last 6 weeks. Again, is that a full extrapolation for the full year? No, we all don't know. This is a competitive environment. But at least we saw over the last 6 weeks that the industry is finally starting to reflect the full cost of tariff in the prices.

Michael Dahl
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And just to dovetail on that, can you give us a sense then of within your margin guidance, and I'm thinking specifically the 6% for North America, how you envision the cadence between first half and second half?

Marc Bitzer
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

Yes. I mean there are several elements coming in that cadence. First of all, you will not see the 6% throughout the full year. And there's -- Q1, in particular, will be still impacted by a number of factors. First of all, we just see now the pricing or more positive pricing coming through, so it's starting to build, and that is still a good guy. On negative side, we will curtail production. We said we will control inventories and we'll correct what we had too much of inventories. That will be a burden on our Q1 numbers in North America because we will adjust inventory. As Roxanne highlighted before, cash is a key priority, and we take that very seriously. So you will have the inventory reduction going against us in Q1, but pricing starts moving in our favor. And on top of that, you have now in Q1, contrary to the last year, you had the full cost of tariffs in there. So there's a number of factors. So Q1 will still be clearly below that 6% and as of Q2, we expect a slow and gradual buildup.

Your next question comes from the line of Rafe Jadrosich from Bank of America.

Rafe Jadrosich
BofA Securities, Research Division

I wanted to ask on the capital allocation for the year. The free cash flow guidance of $400 million to $500 million, the $200 million dividend and then I think $400 million of debt paydown, there is a bit of a funding gap there. So can you just help us understand how we get to the full like debt paydown and dividend relative to the free cash flow guidance?

Roxanne Warner
Executive VP & CFO

One of the things that we touched on in the script earlier as well is that we are pleased with the India transaction that we have executed, which turned our majority stake from 51% to 40%. As of this time, we will retain that position, but we will continue to evaluate all options to further reduce our debt in line with the debt paydown guidance of $400 million.

Rafe Jadrosich
BofA Securities, Research Division

So are there additional India sales likely [ competitive ] in the guidance? Or is that just an option that's sort of on the table? Are there other things outside of India that can be done to generate cash?

Marc Bitzer
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

Yes. So Rafe, it's Marc. As Roxanne said, right now, we feel very comfortable with where we are in India, so we're not going to make a statement about what if. But as you know, first of all, we have a number of minority stakes throughout the world and India is now one of these, where we continue to evaluate all the time where we are. We also still have some smaller asset sale opportunity. They are small, which could be part of closing that element. And so we are -- with the ideas which we have in mind, we're pretty confident that we can close that gap or I mean, specify it very soon. But we feel right now with that paydown, as Roxanne pointed out before, we will get going.

Rafe Jadrosich
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. That's really helpful. And then on the promotional cadence that you're seeing from competitors, it's encouraging to see sort of the improvement at the end of 4Q and into 1Q. Are you seeing like actual price announcements from competitors, either on resale or wholesale -- retail or wholesale? Or do you think they've sort of just worked through that inventory? What's driving this improvement in the promotional cadence that's out there?

Marc Bitzer
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

Yes. So Rafe, so first of all, from our perspective, it's pure outside incumbent on competitors. We don't know what's going through ahead or whatever. So what we observe just more from a data set is we have a fairly sophisticated price scraping tool where every week, we see -- we get thousands of in-cart pricing for every competitor, every product, every SKU. So we have a fairly sophisticated in-house tool. So we pretty much weekly observe everything which was going on in the marketplace. So our comments in terms of promotional depth from what we see is based on this pricing scraping tool, which I would say is very accurate. And also my comment on recovery afterwards is based on this price scraping tool.

The actual mechanism which competitors use, it's their decision. I would say it's partially like we also do, sometimes it's a like-for-like price change and sometimes it's just a reduction of promotional depth. But we don't know ultimately what matters for us, what consumer prices are basically in the carts, and that's what we look at. But I would assume every competitor chooses slightly different tools.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Carter from Stifel.

W. Andrew Carter
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I wanted to ask about the negative price/mix variance in 4Q and how it changed so much from kind of the 3Q guidance. I wanted to ask is that, number one, did -- I think you said at one point that you didn't participate in promotion, but it's obviously a more promotional environment. Was there anything to this about clearing activity, i.e., you had a lot of innovation. You also had a weaker market. Therefore, the old analogs didn't move as quick. So anything you can help us on that big delta and kind of the speed at which it improves through '26?

Marc Bitzer
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

Yes. So Andrew, I think what has changed versus what we had in mind Q3. Coming into Q4, we knew there's still some preloaded inventory of the market. Obviously, because we don't have exact competitor data, I think what we may have underestimated how much there still is out there. So the promotion -- that there will be an aggressive promotional environment, we anticipated, but it was deeper than we expected in all transparency. And now at the same time, and I made that comment in the script already, is the fact that the price is corrected pretty immediately after Black Friday, I would read as an indication that this preloaded inventories out of the system. Because if it would still be there, we would have seen Black Friday pricing continuing longer. So I think the big change is probably there was more inventory out there than we assumed. And right now, we assume that is normalized, and we're kind of -- that is behind us. And again, what I said before, the last 6 weeks would indicate we're now in a more what I would consider normal competitive environment.

W. Andrew Carter
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

And I think at one point, you mentioned you get the sellout data on a weekly basis. We can obviously see the AHAM data. I guess it gets cut monthly, but released quarterly. We can see how far below the discretionary units are relative to '19. Are you seeing a quicker reversion in sell-out? And I guess where I'm going with this is like could there be a massive catch-up in discretionary unit shipments relative to nondiscretionary their higher mix, if the turn has happened quicker about what I'm asking, and I know, just to be clear, your guidance is pretty much for 2026, more of the same on the discretionary, nondiscretionary mix?

Marc Bitzer
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

So Andrew, I mean, first of all, to your question, we get sell-out data, high cash registered data for about 70% of our trade partners. So we have a pretty good sense about how we are doing from a sell-out and coupled with that, we typically also get comparable house sales, i.e., we know how we're doing in the store in terms of picking up amount of sale or not. So we have a very good sense, and that is, of course, critical in particular when we're trying to assess the success of our new product launches.

And a lot of confidence you heard before comes exactly from looking at the sell-out data on a weekly basis. To your question about the discretionary demand, again, reemphasizing, it's not baked in the guidance. Is there a certain chance? Yes. But you also -- we've been waiting for this uptick in discretionary demand for a long time, and that's why we're a little bit cautious at this point. What really -- and again, it's -- the big driver will be ultimately consumer sentiment and the broader perception.

Consumer sentiment, and we've seen that before, changes a lot faster than other indicators. And right now, it's low. And if you just take January, consumer sentiment is low by any definition. So reading that, you wouldn't have a lot of confidence. But again, we have seen this coming around faster. And to your point, yes, that could unlock quite a bit of pent-up discretionary demand, but it's not factored in.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.

Eric Bosshard
Cleveland Research Company LLC

Just 2 housekeeping questions for Roxanne. First of all, a lot of talk about the last 6 weeks on price/mix. Is price/mix been positive in this 1.5%, 2% range over these 6 weeks? Is that what you've seen in your business?

Roxanne Warner
Executive VP & CFO

A couple of things to keep into consideration. One of the time periods where we saw the improvement is Black Friday. And so as you'd expect, during the Black Friday period, we are paying out for the depth of the Black Friday holiday. So the majority of the benefit as it relates to price/mix for the 6 weeks would really come in 2026. As Marc mentioned, from a Q1 perspective, though, keep in mind that there are other items that we will be doing such as reducing production, which would therefore impact the Q1 results. And so we expect price/mix to build up as we go throughout the year.

Marc Bitzer
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

Eric, maybe -- and again, keep in mind, we largely pay our sales incentives to a trade partner on sell-out base. So there's a delay effect when you pay out pretty much a lot of these costs. What we look at as an early indicator, but now we're getting to operation probably is also the gross ASVs, i.e., what is really the gross sales value which we have, and that is favorable in the last 6 weeks. So that is an early indicator that we see the pricing coming through.

Eric Bosshard
Cleveland Research Company LLC

And then the second is the assumption in '26 on outgrowing the flat market by 2 or 3 points. Similar question, Roxanne. Is that what you're seeing now that your business is outgrowing the industry by 2 or 3 points? Is that what's happening now or is that a ramp in '26?

Marc Bitzer
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

So Eric, I can comment on this one. That is almost entirely built on the success of the new product. And that is not just the last 6 weeks. As I mentioned before, ever since -- and again, they didn't all launch at the same time. There was a big KitchenAid launch in end of Q3, but we have other products and by the way, we continue to have new products also in '26. So we see from these new products, the flooring gains, and we also see the sell-out gains. So that pickup in volume is, I would say, almost entirely driven by what we see from the new products.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.

Sam Darkatsh
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Roxanne, JC, Ludo, again, congratulations. And Roxanne, in particular, I know you well, very well deserved. And I think it made us all smile when we saw your -- the announcement. A couple of quick questions. I know we've been dancing around the pricing question quite a bit this morning. The [ 1.75 percentage points ] guide for the year, what's the inherent assumption for industry like-for-like net pricing in order for you to achieve the [ 175 bps ].

Marc Bitzer
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

So Sam, again, we're not publishing what we assume as an industry pricing and a lot depends on what competitors will do. Having said that, you saw earlier, and that's why we had this slide with the 3 components of pricing. It's a better promotional environment and it's new products and mix overall. So yes, there's -- in the [ 175 bps ], there is a component about what we just think from a less promotional environment. Again, we typically assume it's roughly 1/3 probably of that overall assumption or maybe half of a less promotional environment. But in our transparency, yes, we like what we saw over the last 6 weeks. But of course, we're just cautious in terms of extrapolating the last 6 weeks of full year. And I think right now, this assumption is kind of a little bit of middle ground.

Sam Darkatsh
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

So to paraphrase, if there is announced increased industry pricing from competitors that would be additive to your price guide theoretically? I've got a follow-up, but I just wanted to clarify that.

Marc Bitzer
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

Sam, there's obviously a lot of if and when's in forward-looking statements, but let's -- if the promotional environment, which we've seen in the last 6 weeks holds on a full year, we will like the outcome.

Sam Darkatsh
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. My follow-up question, I noticed that the RMI guide remains flat for '26. We recognize that steel is set, but there have been moves of late in things like resins and base metals since the October call. I'm guessing the resins are getting offset by lower oil prices, so I think that's pretty understandable but on the base metal side, can you help us as to how the hedges work from a timing standpoint as to when that might flow through or if you are exposed to higher copper, aluminum, nickel, zinc, that kind of stuff in '26 potentially?

Marc Bitzer
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

Sam, you know our business very well, and you pretty much already gave the answer. So steel, because we have multiyear contracts, itâ€™s flat in our assumption. There's still a couple of moving pieces. On resins is directionally a good guy versus our assumption, but as you point out, aluminum and copper, in particular, a little bit of a bad guy, a little bit buffered because, as you know, we go out with hedges with certain hedging corridors. And that's why we're saying right now, the sum of it all is -- we basically assume a flat or not a major surprise. And again, it's a wash of ins and outs, but we feel pretty comfortable about that RMI assumption.

Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs.

Charles Perron-Piché
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

This is Charles Perron in for Susan. First, I just want to go back on the cost action, the $150 million plus tailwind for 2026. Can you talk about some of the -- what is the new actions that are going to be implemented this year versus the carryover impact from 2025 action? Can you elaborate on some of these measures put in place in terms of automation, strategic sourcing and footprint of rationalization? And what factors are you considering before determining whether additional actions would be necessary?

Marc Bitzer
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

Yes. So Charles, it's Marc. First of all, there is some carryover, but frankly, it's not that much. It's obvious overall, this $150 million plus is probably less than 1/3 is carryover. And that largely comes from the actions which we initiated about the cost takeout last year, but just carried through and the additional actions, vertical integration is actually a new angle which we're pursuing. We've made good experience with vertically integrating some components actually in our Mexico factories, and we will aggressively go after that also in North America, where we expect quite a sizable saving on respective components and frankly, also just more stability in our supply chain. That's one element.

Automation is an ongoing effort and will accelerate. That will also drive benefits. What we refer to as strategic sourcing initiative is a fairly elaborate and sophisticated process, which we don't do every year because it's way too complex. Last time we've done that 6 years ago, and we got a lot of savings out of this one. It basically goes down to you take apart every single component, you weigh it, you do a global completely clean sheet assessment, what should cost be, we're putting it out for bidding across the world, so it's a very elaborate thorough process. And again, just for complexity, you can't do that every year. But given that it's 6 years ago, I think it's right. And we know what tool. We've done it before, and we expect probably in the overall context, almost 1/3 of cost savings coming out of this one.

Charles Perron-Piché
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's super helpful color, Marc. And then second, I just want to ask on the continued progress you're seeing in small domestic appliances. It's good to see the 10% sales growth this quarter. When considering the business, how do you balance the growth momentum that you're seeing here versus holding to your 16% EBIT margin as you look to maximize your returns over time?

Ludovic Beaufils
Executive President of KitchenAid Small Appliances, Latin America, Global Information Tech. & Design

Yes, Charles, this is Ludo. So I'll take this one. So as you said, we're very happy with the performance of the SDA business. We grew at 10% in Q3 and again in Q4, and we have similar projections for 2026 going forward. From a margin standpoint, what we believe is most of the -- the highest value we can create, frankly, is through growth given the level of accretiveness we have from the margins already. So we're very focused on delivering that growth, and we're effectively reinvesting the margin that we create in excess of this 15% to 16% margin range into further acceleration.

And your final questions come from the line of Jeffrey Stevenson from Loop Capital Markets.

Jeffrey Stevenson
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

You reported healthy share gains in the third quarter from your new product introductions, which offset your first half share losses. But I was wondering if you could comment on your fourth quarter share gains and whether heavier competitor discounting and a soft underlying R&R demand environment prevented similar levels of share gains during the quarter?

Marc Bitzer
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

So Jeffrey, basically what we reported in Q3, we picked up quite a bit of share with the new product, and that offset what we lost in the entire first half. In Q4, the positive momentum on new products continued. So we continue to gain share with the new product. But of course, by definition, the overall promotional period in Q4 is just a bigger portion of the quarter than in our prior quarter. During the promotion period, and that's what I indicated before, we did not pick up share. We just decided to hold our ground, and that's what we've done. So you have continued gains of share with the new products, but in promotion period, we didn't pick up a lot more. So overall, it ended with a full year where we have a small market share gain for the entire year in North America and almost entirely driven by the back half and almost entirely driven by new products.

Jeffrey Stevenson
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Understood. And then I wanted to go back to comments earlier on replacement demand. And this was tracking to roughly 2/3 of North America MDA sales last year, which is well above normalized levels. And just so I'm clear in your guidance, are you not expecting any moderation in the percentage of replacement demand in 2026, unless we see some improvement in existing housing turnover? And then over the midterm, do you believe the percentage of replacement sales could move closer to 50% once the industry returns to a more normalized repair and remodel demand environment?

Marc Bitzer
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

So Jeffrey, there's two components. The absolute number of replacement volume we get, we expect to stay stable. And we've seen that pretty stable now for an extended time period. And again, it just comes a simple math, it's installed base, and we know that. And the overall usage in terms of year has come down a little bit because people are using it more intensively. That has now been stable for, I would say, 2, almost 3 years on a pure replacement side. So the volume will stay the same. But of course, when by definition, finally, the discretionary demand picks up, the percentage of the total market of replacement will come down. Right now, it's well above 60%.

And in -- I wouldn't even call it peak cycle, I would call it earlier or mid-cycle, the discretionary side should easily cover 50%, not easy, but we had years where discretionary side was up to 60%. So it's -- the percentage is all driven by how much we would see on the discretionary demand going forward.

So with that, I think that was the last question. I'm sorry, we went a little bit over time today, but there's new faces, new voices, and then I think a lot of good questions. Again, as you heard before from us, 2025 is behind us. It's in the rearview. We right now look just forward to '26. There are some encouraging signs already happening now in '26. And I think we laid out the catalyst, why we believe we are confident and it's in our execution and control to deliver on them and that gives us the confidence beyond '26. So thanks for joining me today and looking forward to talk to you again next quarter.
