[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Asad Haider from Goldman Sachs.

Asad Haider
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. Joaquin, maybe just a big picture question for you. You're entering this year in a clear position of strength following what's been one of the best performance years for the stock in about 20 years. You've had momentum in both business segments. You're generating tremendous free cash flow and that you're saying is going to continue to elevate. And you've now started to talk more about double-digit revenue growth by the latter part of the decade, although Street consensus is currently modeling something in the 6% range.

So if you could just maybe double-click a little bit more on what the key levers are to bridge to that double-digit growth profile from where we sit today, particularly in the context of the current revenue base that's now approaching $100 billion and remains sizable through the end of the decade even with the Ortho spin.

And I guess what we're really trying to understand is how much of that acceleration comes from the organic pipeline versus acquisitions versus portfolio pruning. And I guess related, what innings are we in of the strategic repositioning away from lower growth segments like you're doing with Ortho towards higher-growth segments?

Joaquin Duato
CEO & Chairman

Thank you. Great question. And sure, I mean, we came out of a really successful 2025, leaving the STELARA biosimilars in the rearview mirror and initiating a cycle of accelerated growth for Johnson & Johnson. And you have seen that we have provided a guidance for 2026, which is strong and ahead of expectations. And as I said before, we have line of sight to double-digit growth in the later part of the decade, which is especially remarkable for a company that according to our guidance would be $100 billion in sales in 2026.

So what are the reasons to believe? The reasons to believe are focused on the strength of our portfolio and pipeline. And let me now take you through the 6 areas of focus that we are investing into the future. Let me start with Oncology. Our ambition with Oncology is to become the #1 oncology company, reaching $50 billion by the end of the decade, sustained by our success in multiple myeloma and also in solid tumors with lung cancer, prostate cancer and bladder cancer. We are very confident on our progress there in our pipeline, and I'm sure we'll have some time to discuss that later in the call.

In our second area in Innovative Medicine, which is Immunology, we are focusing on 3 major blockbusters. One is TREMFYA, which has been very successful in IBD. You have seen the growth in the fourth quarter, really spectacular, 65%. TREMFYA in IBD launch is doing really well. And as a reminder, in the case of STELARA, IBD was 75% of the sales. So there is significant growth for TREMFYA ahead of us. We see TREMFYA more than a $10 billion asset.

The second one is ICOTYDE. ICOTYDE is the trademark of icotrokinra, our oral IL-23 blocker. We see the oral IL-23 blocker expanding the market, becoming a new blockbuster for us. We expect to have the launch of ICOTYDE in 2026, initially in psoriasis. This is going to be a transformational change for the treatment of these diseases, and we plan to continue to develop ICOTYDE too in IBD, in inflammatory bowel disease.

And finally, the third blockbuster in which we will see data this year is our co-antibody therapeutic for patients that are refractory to biologics. I think that's a great solution for these patients. Many of them relapse. So 3 major blockbusters in Immunology, which are largely derisked. Some of them are approved file or you're going to see data very, very soon.

To end, in Innovative Medicine, we are very encouraged by the progress of SPRAVATO, more than 60% growth, and also the very successful launch of CAPLYTA in adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder. We're seeing the first data coming in, very, very encouraging. We see CAPLYTA, as we discussed, as additive to our growth, and more than $5 billion business. So all positives in our Innovative Medicine group, clearly driving this line of sight to double-digit growth by the end of the decade.

If I move to our MedTech business, our Cardiovascular sector, very strong growth in 2025, double-digit growth. It's reaching $9 billion. It's one of the largest cardiovascular franchises in the industry. We are in 3 major markets, which are specialty markets with high growth; cardiac ablation, where we are the leaders, and we plan to expand our leadership in PFA with the launch of a new catheter every year and new CARTO versions, as Tim will explain later; our strong position both with Abiomed and Shockwave in heart recovery and in calcified arterial disease. So that's going to be a growth driver for us into the rest of the decade.

In Surgery, we have had strong results, both in wound closure and in biosurgery, which are high single digit in both areas. We just filed for OTTAVA, which is going to make us a relevant player in the surgery robotics market, which is an area in which we have all the right to compete. Let me remind all of you that we are in all hospitals in the world, and we already participate in all surgeries, and we plan to be a relevant player in robotic surgery with OTTAVA, and also with the launch of MONARCH in urology, in which we are going to have a unique position.

Then finally, in Vision, you see our results in Vision. It's a market with growth. We're gaining share, and it's an area of innovation in which we plan to invest.

So we have about a dozen new product launches for the company. Some of them are already approved, most of them submitted. So I would say that in that sense, it's essentially what I would call derisked. And some of you have called our story of growth in the second half of the decade as one of the cleanest stories of growth for the health care sector, for the health care entire sector overall.

So we feel very confident about our outlook. It's reflected in our guidance for 2026. And I can assure you that everybody here at Johnson & Johnson is focused on doing exactly what we do best, which is looking for innovation in medicines and medical technologies to improve the standard of care of the millions of patients that we serve, and we are convinced that, that will translate in strong business results.

Our next question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.

Larry Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I'll echo my congratulations on a nice end to the year here. So Tim, there's some dynamics in the MedTech market that you called out in the slides as well as the loss of coverage in the U.S. from the enhanced subsidies expiring. How are you thinking about the MedTech market in 2026 relative to 2025? And how are you thinking about J&J's adjusted operational growth in '26 versus '25? Do you expect an acceleration? And it would be helpful if you could touch upon the outlook for your EP business, which is growing below market.

Tim Schmid
Executive VP & Worldwide Chairman of MedTech

Larry, thank you for the question. Let me touch quickly on the first question around ACA subsidies and put that one to bed. Firstly, based on what we know today, we do not expect the loss of ACA subsidies or any potential policy changes under the One Big Beautiful Bill to have a material impact on our MedTech performance. And while we'll continue to monitor how coverage dynamics evolve, at this stage, we see no indication of an impact on our growth trajectory. The primary constraint, as you know, Larry, in our business is really more about clinical capacity, not coverage levels. And procedure demands remain very robust across our portfolio, which I think really speak to the resilience of the businesses that we decided to participate in.

Turning to your question about the year, we do expect to see accelerate -- we expect the year to be better in 2026 than it was in '25. And I think it's important to maybe hedge this question on really our strategy. And I think you know for the last couple of years, we've been very clear in articulating our strategy focused on shifting our portfolio into higher innovation, higher growth and higher margin markets. And as you just heard from Joaquin, we have deliberately chosen to focus on our 3 focus areas of CV, Surgery and Vision.

And I think our results, Larry, speak for themselves. Our strategy is working. We said we would accelerate our performance in the back half of '25, and we did exactly that, beating consensus for the third consecutive quarter. And what we're most proud of, Larry, is that we saw acceleration across the board. As you heard from Joaquin, Cardiovascular, now one of our largest businesses at $9 billion, grew 15.2% operationally in 2025, driven by success of Abio and Shockwave, both double-digit growers, and increasing performance in EP, which I'll touch on a little later.

Vision, strong mid- to high-single-digit performer. Double-digit growth in Surgical Vision. And of course, we couldn't be more excited by the growth opportunity that will come with OTTAVA as we look to commercialize that first in the U.S. hopefully this year.

We've also seen continued improvement of Ortho. You would have expected maybe some distraction as a result of the announcement we made. We've seen exactly the opposite, with sequential growth during the quarter and 3.5% in Q4.

And so I'll finally reinforce, Larry, that our portfolio transformation is working. If you look at the $34 billion business today, we have roughly half of our assets participating in higher-growth markets, growing north of 5%. That's compared to about 20% in 2018. And this will catapult to north of 70% following the Ortho separation. So as a result, we believe, frankly, that our best days are ahead, and we remain very confident in our ability to drive accelerated operational growth as we further push into higher areas of innovation, growth and margins.

Let me touch quickly on EP, because I think that was another part of your question. The results speak for themselves, and they're speaking loud and clear. We're seeing continued acceleration in the markets that matter most, especially here in the U.S. and in Europe. You will have seen that in the fourth quarter, our growth accelerated to 9.5%. We're on the cusp of once again double-digit growth here in the United States, which is by far and away the most important market. We're seeing this driven by the success of VARIPULSE, more than 40,000 cases today, Larry, with a benchmark safety profile.

As you heard from Joaquin, we've made a commitment to an additional catheter each year for the foreseeable future, starting with Dual Energy STSF, followed by OMNYPULSE, which is a large-tip focal catheter. And we're also doubling down on our leadership position in mapping. And we now see really customers shifting back to CARTO based on the integration we have across our portfolio. And just to put a point on this, Larry, for example, our CARTO 3 System is widely recognized as the industry benchmark in mapping. In fact, in a recent study, it found that patients treated with PFA devices, whether that be ours or the competitions using CARTO, were 61%, once again, 61% less likely to experience AFib-related readmissions, which I think further reinforces the competitive advantage we have in this portfolio.

And so I've said this before, Larry, and I'll end by saying that we are not rolling over. J&J's strength lies in our comprehensive portfolio of integrated EP solutions, mapping, ablation and cardiac imaging technologies, combined with our best-in-class mappers. And we remain resolute and confident that our deep EP expertise earned over 30 years and our robust pipeline position us well to continue to drive global leadership in this important space. Thanks, Larry.

Next question today is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan Chase & Company.

Christopher Schott
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats on the results. Joe, can you just elaborate a little bit more on how to think about margin progression over time at J&J? You've obviously highlighted the potential for accelerating top-line growth over the next several years. Should we think about that higher level of top-line growth being associated with greater margin expansion? Or is this kind of 50 basis point year type improvement that you're seeing this year a reasonable proxy to think about margin expansion for J&J over time?

Joseph Wolk
Executive VP & CFO

Chris, thanks for the question. Yes, it's a great question. As we look at the margin expansion, the idea would be to continue to improve our infrastructure. What gives me confidence with respect to 2026 outlook of at least 50 basis points is, as you know, with the Orthopaedics separation, much like we did with the Consumer Health separation, we're going to take this opportunity to look and see where there's areas of opportunity efficiency to eliminate stranded costs. While that will probably need to be in place for 2027, we're going to get a jump start on that in 2026.

There's also, as you know from recent calls, efforts underway to improve our operating margins, our gross margins specifically in our manufacturing footprint, largely in the MedTech space.

And then lastly, while we will have continued STELARA erosion, it will be off a smaller base. So that will have less of an impact going forward. And so I wouldn't want to give you a longer-term outlook. What I can say is I'll harken back to our last Investor Day where we said that earnings would be commensurate with sales growth. So you can expect that the margin profile will improve in conjunction with the sales growth profile as we move out to the next couple of years and into the back half of this decade.

Next question today is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank.

Joanne Wuensch
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I'll add my congrats on the good quarter. I just want to spend a minute or 2 talking about Vision Care. You highlighted that as one of the 3 growth areas in medical technology. It looks like in your Surgical business, it was a little bit slower during the quarter versus what we saw -- in the United States versus what we saw outside the United States. If you could tease that apart a little bit, and your views on the health of the contact lens market would be really welcome.

Tim Schmid
Executive VP & Worldwide Chairman of MedTech

Joanne, thank you for your note. And once again, we have doubled down and really focusing on Vision as one of our 3 priority areas within MedTech. And as you highlighted, a strong fourth quarter at growth of just under 7%. Strong underlying performance within our contact lens category. While we did see a little softness, Joanne, in Asia Pacific, underlying demand is robust, and we saw tremendous growth at roughly 5.3% with share gains, driven by the continued rollout of our ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family, which I think you probably know that we've added to with the addition of a product focused on multifocal astigmatism, only daily disposable available for patients suffering with both presbyopia and astigmatism. And so we believe that's going to be a nice growth driver for the future.

Turning to Surgical Vision, growth of close to 11% in the quarter, and that's all driven by our doubling down of our focus on premium intraocular lenses, both with TECNIS Odyssey launch here in the U.S. last year and PureSee more broadly globally. As you look to 2026, we're going to be further enhancing that performance by building out the portfolio, specifically with the launch of PureSee here in the United States.

You touched on our fourth quarter performance. Underlying performance of our premium IOLs here in the U.S. was outstanding. We did see that offset somewhat by some ongoing market declines in some of the legacy categories, which we're working to address, but we're confident that our Surgical Vision business can continue to be a strong double-digit grower for the foreseeable future.

A couple of other areas I'll focus on here is that we are expanding global market share, both in contact lenses and Surgical Vision, not just winning here in the but more importantly, globally. We're focusing very much on portfolio optimization. And I do think the Ortho separation enables greater capital allocation to Vision, supporting both R&D, commercial execution and digital transformation. And so we're thrilled with the continued improvement in Surgical Vision and have great confidence in that continuing. Thank you.

Next question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley.

Terence Flynn
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. Obviously, multiple myeloma is another one of your key growth drivers here. I was wondering, post a lot of the earlier stage data, earlier line data we've seen for TECVAYLI, if you could speak to how you're thinking about positioning here of that franchise relative to CARVYKTI.

And then the related question is, I know FDA published some final guidance regarding MRD negativity and CR's endpoint. So just thinking about how you might implement that across your development portfolio and what that could mean for time lines.

Jennifer Taubert
Executive VP & Worldwide Chairman of Innovative Medicine

Thanks for the question, Terence, and good morning, everyone. Yes, for multiple myeloma, we were absolutely thrilled with the data that we saw for TECVAYLI plus DARZALEX in the second line plus setting, as well as most recently, the TECVAYLI data in patients who are refractory to anti-CD38 and lenalidomide therapy. And maybe if I take a step back, over the past 20 years, J&J therapies have dramatically improved survival for people with multiple myeloma, from 3- to 5-year survival rates to 10 to 15 years now or more. Yet despite these advances, multiple myeloma is still -- it's a complex disease, a heterogeneous disease. And about 40% of patients are currently in the second-line and third-line settings.

So how do all of these agents fit? And why do we see that this is such an extraordinary opportunity? Well, first, if we start off with the TEC-dara information, plus TEC-9 and CARVYKTI, together, they really provide highly effective agents that allow treatment that's tailored to the treatment goals, the patient setting, access, the patient status and the prior therapy. So there's a number of things that get taken into account. So if we start off with TEC plus dara. This is really community-ready therapy that's proven an unprecedented efficacy rate in the second line plus setting. The hazard ratio was 0.17. And so this is for patients who are CD38 naive or are CD38 experienced. And this is about 70% of the population in that second line and in the third line setting.

If you take a look at TEC-dara data, again, extraordinarily impressive, 71% reduction in the risk of disease progression, 40% reduction (sic) [ improvement ] in overall survival. And this is for patients who are refractory to anti-CD38 therapy and lenalidomide therapies. And so you can see the 70% TEC-dara and then the 30% for the TEC-9 data. And then when you bring CARVYKTI in, CARVYKTI really is the most successful CAR-T therapy. We just announced we're over 10,000 patients who've been infused with this. And this is a single-dose therapy with really a tremendous shot at what we would count as cure. And we're the only CAR-T therapy that's got that superior overall survival versus the standard of care.

And so really, when you take a look at what the goals are for that patient, what their prior lines of therapy would be, and what the practice setting is, J&J now has an option for really every one of those patients in that second line, third-line setting. So we see a lot of growth potential ahead for these agents as well as DARZALEX in the frontline setting.

John Reed
Executive Vice President of Innovative Medicine and R&D

Yes. And maybe to get into your MRD, but first, just to supplement a little bit. I'd also note that the TECVAYLI regimens, whether it's monotherapy in CD38 refractory patients or the combo with DARZALEX in patients who are CD38 naive, or have been exposed but still remain sensitive, these are dexamethasone-free regimens, which means the patients aren't on high-dose steroids, which really is an improvement on quality of life.

The other thing I wanted to note is that the FDA, in fact, was so impressed with our MajesTEC-3 data that unsolicited, they contacted us and offered a priority review voucher to accelerate bringing this new regimen to patients. So really excited with that recent interaction with the FDA.

Indeed, on MRD, that is exciting for us. Last year, there was an ODAC that endorsed that concept of using this biomarker, if you will, approach to finding those rare residual malignant cells. Much of the evidence behind that, frankly, was pioneered by J&J over the years. So we're excited that, that is an option. We are mindful, however, that it's only not in the United States. So at this point, we'll still have to deliver progression-free and overall survival data for other territories. So I suspect that will continue to be an element of our protocols. But indeed, we will be speaking with the agency about opportunities to accelerate some of our development.

And in that regard, I think a place where this could be particularly apropos is with our new trispecific antibody for myeloma, ramantamig, which brings the features of both TEC and TAL into a single molecule with unprecedented efficacy. Improved tolerability as well. Fewer, for example, of the taste effects that you might see with TALVEY; less weight loss, et cetera; really improved tolerability. And then a great convenience that makes it apropos for the community setting with only one step-up dose and Q4-week dosing for monthly dosing. Really excited about the pilot data we're seeing in newly diagnosed myeloma in combination with dara with that trispecific, and that could be a really apropos place to discuss with the FDA using MRD negativity.

Next question today is coming from Danielle Antalffy from UBS.

Danielle Antalffy
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I'll echo everyone's [Audio Gap] strong end to the year and happy New Year. Just a question on this move to higher growth end markets. I appreciate that you've done a lot of and are doing a lot of portfolio pruning now. You mentioned the 70% in a few years here. I mean, ultimately, I guess it's 2 [Audio Gap]. Do you see that 70% moving higher? Or do you think that's like sort of the aspirational peak? That's the first part.

And the second part is, what are some other growth markets, whether it's in Innovative Medicine or MedTech where you guys aren't participating today that you see [indiscernible] to participate over that time frame, whether it's via organic or inorganic moves?

Tim Schmid
Executive VP & Worldwide Chairman of MedTech

Danielle, thank you. I mean our aspiration is not to put a limit on the high-growth markets in which we participate. And I think we can conservatively say that once we separate Ortho, we'll be at least at 70%. And there is tremendous opportunity even just focused within the 3 business units we've decided to focus on within MedTech, both in Cardiovascular, in Surgery and in Vision. I think we've built your confidence around Cardiovascular continuing to be a strong double-digit grower. Surgery, one of our profitable businesses, where we maintain leadership positions, both in contact lens and Surgical Vision. We believe it's going to be a strong middle to high single-digit grower.

And then Surgery is the major opportunity and really the catapult to our growth. And that comes down to our belief in OTTAVA. As you heard from Joaquin, we are absolutely resolute in our commitment to play a bigger role beyond open and laparoscopic surgery in robotics with OTTAVA. And what we are most confident about is that we have something that is unique and different and something that surgeons and health system CEOs tell us every day that they need.

And so while we're excited by the recent milestone and the submission for approval, we're just getting started. And what really highlights the fact that this is different is you'll recall that this is a very different regulatory pathway we chose. This is a de novo pathway. And the reason we chose that pathway is that there is no predicate device, nothing that can be compared against. And so this is a novel platform where there's no reference or predicate device. And so that, coupled with the fact that we're going after the U.S., should further reinforce our confidence in the fact that we believe we have something that is really different.

Now we're not stopping just in the U.S. We're building our submissions in a parallel path fashion outside of the U.S. with a focus on Japan and some select U.S. markets (sic) [ non-U.S. markets ]. And you will have recalled from the announcement we made 2 weeks ago, we're also already expanding into our next IDE clinical study in the lower abdomen. So make no mistake that we believe that we can and will be a formidable player in surgical robotics. We don't take the current incumbent for granted by any means, but we do think that presence we have in open, laparoscopic, and soon-to-be robotic surgery give us a right to play and a tremendous opportunity to drive to those high levels of growth that we've committed in the back half of the decade.

Jennifer Taubert
Executive VP & Worldwide Chairman of Innovative Medicine

And then in Innovative Medicine, we are looking to expand in a number of really exciting areas right now where we've got clinical work already underway. And so to give maybe a few examples, RYBREVANT in head and neck cancer and colorectal cancer, of which clinical trial is underway. IMAAVY, which we haven't spoken about yet today, but areas such as Sjogren's disease and SLE, lupus, areas of really high unmet medical need.

Atopic dermatitis, of which we made a number of key acquisitions and licensing at the end of 2024, that give us a stable of assets there that we're working towards. B-cell malignancies with our [ BI-CAR ] that's in development and even milvexian that we're developing in partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb that we're very, very excited about for atrial fibrillation and secondary stroke prevention. So a number of additional really key diseases that could be growth drivers for us in the future.

Next question today is coming from Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Securities.

Vamil Divan
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

I just want to ask on INLEXZO. It's a couple of questions here. But just one, any sort of initial feedback you can share with us in terms of the initial launch and kind of what doctors and patients are saying? If there's any update on when you expect to get a permanent J-code?

And then finally, just I see you listed SunRISe-5 data and potential submission on your events list for 2026. So that's good to see. I'm curious if you can just talk about how that data and how that might impact the addressable population for the product. And then tied to that, SunRISe-3, I thought, might come this year. You didn't include that one on the list. So I'm just curious, any update on timing of when we might see data from SunRISe-3?

Jennifer Taubert
Executive VP & Worldwide Chairman of Innovative Medicine

Great. Thanks so much for the question on INLEXZO. So we are really pleased with the launch and what we're seeing in terms of interest and receptivity by both urologists as well as the patients who've had application of the device. As you recall, we've really launched into the BCG unresponsive population. And as you noted, we're actually looking to further expand that through SunRISe-5, the BCG experienced, and then SunRISe-3 population, the BCG-naive population. So, so far, the interest and enthusiasm on this has been really, really robust.

We are anticipating the permanent J-code at the beginning of the second quarter, sort of in that April time frame, which we think is going to be a really nice catalyst for utilization. And so we do continue to believe strongly that this is one of our $5 billion-plus assets, and really look forward to getting that permanent J-code in the second quarter.

John, do you want to talk about -- yes.

John Reed
Executive Vice President of Innovative Medicine and R&D

Yes. Just we're making great progress with this lead product, INLEXZO, but I would also remind that we see a whole series of innovative products where we use these devices in the bladder to deliver different payloads. The next one on deck is containing erdafitinib, that's the same targeted therapy that is currently marketed as BALVERSA for metastatic bladder cancer, but here delivered through a unique device, a customized device. It's not the same one as INLEXZO, but works in much the same way to deliver that target therapy. There, we are focusing on the so-called intermediate risk population, whereas INLEXZO is targeted for the high-risk population. So this broadens our coverage of patients with bladder cancer.

And just to remind people that localized bladder cancer represents about 600,000 new cases per year, and another 400,000 cases annually of patients who've relapsed and looking for a solution that would allow them to save their bladder. So it's about 1 million patients a year. Between INLEXZO and now TAR-210, the erdafitinib carrying device, we'll be able to really address a very large percentage of these patients with these bladder-sparing technologies. With TAR-210, the success rate we've been seeing with complete responses has been north of 90%. And so we're super excited about that, and there'll be other devices with different payloads to come over time. So we see this as a platform that will address this incredible unmet need and that will be a big growth driver for J&J.

I would finally close by just giving a shout out to our colleagues in MedTech, because this is just a wonderful example of how Innovative Medicine and MedTech can come together, bringing devices and drugs together in an unprecedented way, and we're looking for more ways to do that in the future.

The next question is coming from Shagun Singh from RBC Capital Markets.

Shagun Singh Chadha
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Joaquin and Joe, could you spend some time and elaborate on your next step with respect to the talc litigation, implications of the initial Daubert decision? I know you indicated it will be appealed. If reserves need to be stepped up? And then most importantly, what are your plans for an eventual resolution and risk mitigation here? I think this may be contributing to the modest top down today, even though you reported strong results and you have a very strong outlook through the end of the decade.

Joseph Wolk
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I'll start, Shagun, and then, Joaquin, I'll turn it over to you. So thank you very much for the question. And I want to thank you for acknowledging just the strong results and outlook of the business, which is really what is at the heart of Johnson & Johnson. So last night, the special master reviewing the Daubert motions in the talc MDL issued what is known as a report and recommendation. So that really has no legal import until the judge actually accepts this recommendation.

The recommendation itself excluded certain aspects of the plaintiffs' expert witnesses and their opinions. And simultaneously, the recommendation also endorsed virtually all of our opinions of our experts. However, there were other parts of the recommendation where the special master clearly failed to apply the new federal rules of evidence known as Rule 702, which really reinforced, starting in December of 2023, the gatekeeping responsibilities that the special master should have had. We will certainly appeal those erroneous parts of the recommendation to the district court. Again, this recommendation from the special master has no legal consequence until the appeal is resolved.

The bottom line is this is not going to change our strategy. We will continue to aggressively fight in the court system each and every one of these meritless claims. We will do so whether it's at original trial or through appeal. And we will continue to really bring to light the actions of the plaintiffs' bar, the tactics that they use, the third-party litigation financing, all which is really undermining U.S. business and U.S. competitiveness overall.

Joaquin?

Joaquin Duato
CEO & Chairman

Thank you, Joe. Shagun, I would tell you and I would tell investors, we have been navigating this talc issue already for a decade. And we have been able to continue to deliver excellent results, invest in our business and continue to return value to shareholders. So let's focus on the real story here. The real story is our successful 2025, the strong guidance for 2026, and what you said before, our line of sight for double-digit growth in the later part of the decade. This is a clean story for us, one of the cleanest stories in the entire health care sector, and we are in a position of strength today.

And as Joe said, we are going to continue to fight these meritless claims, and we're going to continue with our strategy of litigating every single one. What I can assure you and all investors is that every single employee of Johnson & Johnson does not get distracted. They wake up every day with the intent to bring new medicines and medical technologies that improve the standard of care of the millions of patients that we serve every day, and that's really our goal. Let's focus on what really matters. Let's not get distracted.

So our final question today is coming from Alexandria Hammond from Wolfe Research.

Alexandria Hammond
Wolfe Research, LLC

On milvexian, can you talk a little bit about your confidence in this asset? What do you think you'll need to show to be competitive in what's already a pretty crowded space with another potential next-generation Factor XI from Bayer? And I guess as a quick follow-up, how can you leverage your past experiences commercializing XARELTO to make another multibillion-dollar opportunity for J&J?

John Reed
Executive Vice President of Innovative Medicine and R&D

Yes. So on milvexian, we're expecting data readouts later this year for both secondary stroke as well as atrial fibrillation. We often get asked about atrial fibrillation because the competitor molecule had failed in that indication, and we cite a couple of things. One is that milvexian, at least in vitro, is about 10x more potent than the other molecule that is being developed by another company. And we know from monitoring the aPTT biomarker, the thromboplastin time, that we have very effective reductions in clotting at the dose that we have selected for atrial fibrillation, which is 100 milligrams twice a day. So we feel that we've got the right dose and the right study design. So we'll be looking forward to those data later this year.

Jennifer Taubert
Executive VP & Worldwide Chairman of Innovative Medicine

We're really excited about the opportunity with milvexian. And what we're really looking to show there is clear superiority in terms of safety and bleeding risk. We know from all of our experience in the market with XARELTO that there are a lot of patients that are not treated or are undertreated because of fear of safety risk. And so we think there's extraordinary need for a highly efficacious and highly safe with low bleeding risk product in the market, both for atrial fibrillation, and then we're very excited about the possibilities in secondary stroke as well. So we're looking forward to this product that we're developing in collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. It is absolutely one of our $5 billion-plus assets on our list.
