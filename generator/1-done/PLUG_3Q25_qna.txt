[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.

Andre Stillman Adams
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

You've got Andre Adams on for Colin. I got a couple of questions for you. So first, could you just speak to the cadence of fuel margin improvements and when we might expect margins for that business to turn positive?

Andrew Marsh
Executive Chairman & CEO

You want to take that, Paul?

Paul Middleton
Executive VP, CAO & CFO

Which business did you ask about, Andre? Was there a specific one you mentioned?

Andre Stillman Adams
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Fuel. Fuel.

Paul Middleton
Executive VP, CAO & CFO

Yes. So I'd say what you see as the progression in the margin even in Q3. We had some plant issues in the network from the suppliers and from ours. But despite that, you see a progression because of the strategic agreement we struck that we're starting to see the benefits from that. You'll see even incrementally more benefits from that in Q4 given the leverage of that. And there's certain aspects of that agreement that allow us to work with them and collaborate to navigate the network more efficiently as we move forward.

So again, it will start to build. Plus Plug is continually investing in its own infrastructure and our own networks and how we distribute and manage our plants. And so there's just this continual building process. So I expect to see another big step function improvement in Q4. And I think in the course of next year, kind of -- targeting kind of middle of the year, moving to that breakeven target, if not sooner. So we're laser-focused in it, and we've postured with the right cost structures between what we have in our supply and the supply agreement of the new arrangement that we can continue focusing on all the levers that drive it that direction.

Andre Stillman Adams
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Great. And then I appreciate the color on the electrolyzer pipeline. And just hoping you could give us some expectations on the cadence of growth on an annual basis that you would expect for that business?

Andrew Marsh
Executive Chairman & CEO

Do you want to take that, Jose? I'm going to just add. We, we're not yet providing any guidance for 2026. But there is a good deal of activity in the electrolyzer business. We would expect growth next year, and our plan is for the business to continue to grow. We've been very cautious about guidance because 1 quarter slip on a project developing can change the results.

But as you could see, we grew 43% versus the last quarter. We have a strong quarter coming up. I think most of Galp will be deployed by the fourth quarter. And that were shipped by the fourth quarter. So I think you'll continue to see, I think, some good announcements coming out and good progress, especially later this quarter and the beginning of next quarter with announcements.

Jose Crespo
President, Chief Revenue Officer & GM of Material Handling

You're right. We will see some good progress in the next few weeks on projects that we're going to be able to deploy in 2026. So we will be able to see revenue from those projects in 2026. We've been working in many of the projects that we have in the funnel for years now. These projects take a long time to materialize and to go to FID.

But we are seeing that many of these projects are going to come to FID in 2026 and 2027 because they are very large projects. It will take time to also deploy them once they go into execution mode. In many of them, we have the project-based revenue recognition in the contracts. So we will see some revenue. And as Andy said, we will see growth in 2026. And as time goes by and more projects go FID, we're going to continue to see that growth into the following years.

Andrew Marsh
Executive Chairman & CEO

One thing I would add, Jose, is our sales team has said, the quality of the engagements are so much higher than we've ever had.

Jose Crespo
President, Chief Revenue Officer & GM of Material Handling

100%. I mentioned a little bit of that in the introduction, we are seeing the quality of projects and projects that have high probability to go FID in the funnel compared to a few years ago where we had a lot of projects that had not so many chances to actually materialize.

Next question is coming from Manav Gupta from UBS.

Manav Gupta
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I just wanted to focus a little bit on the news announcements today morning. I think you signed a nonbinding letter of intent with -- improvement of asset through monetizing of electricity as the data center. So help us understand a little bit your leverage to this entire data center and AI revolution and the various ways in which Plug can benefit from it. I'm assuming through power would be the primary ways. If you could help us elaborate on those.

Andrew Marsh
Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think it's -- we've taken a step back. And first, I want to -- want to make a note, we expect this transaction will close in the first quarter. It's been far along. So we think it's mid-first quarter when this closes. This will provide the liquidity on the balance sheet which part of Project Quantum Leap has been about. And Plug next year is going to be sitting there with a strong balance sheet, which will have a complementary improvement to our income statement.

So it's really about liquidity to start. And the second item that's driven a good deal of this is -- and I touched on in my opening remarks about not only our relationship with a large industrial gas company but relationships with people who are going to build hydrogen plants who want our electrolyzers. So we looked at the world and said, we know how to do a combination of sourcing competitive hydrogen and generating competitive -- generating hydrogen to balance those two out.

As part of this program, we've been exploring with our product management team and development team, opportunities to provide levels of backup power using hydrogen to support the data center deployments. It will make sense in some applications. And so that is a real, real focus that Jose and the team will continue to be engaging in next year.

So it's not going to be primary power, but at least in 2026, I think when you get in out years, us here in North America are not always aware of activities going in Europe, including hydrogen pipelines. And in that case, Plug fuel cells become a real viable solution even for primary power.

So we're excited. I'm primarily excited that Jose and Paul next year will have -- not be spending as much time worrying about where is the cash going to come from. Paul, I think your cash usage last quarter was -- operational cash usage was $90 million, and that was a 50% improvement. And so we're going to have a good balance sheet to really position ourselves to achieve being -- achieving the goal of being cash flow neutral as soon as possible, and that is the goal. I hope that helped.

Next question is coming from Eric Stine from Craig-Hallum.

Eric Stine
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

So just sticking with the data center opportunity. I remember several years ago, you had a -- I think it was a pilot project with Microsoft to some degree. And so I'm curious, I know that over the last, I don't know, year to 2 years, you've been prioritizing some other growth initiatives. But curious kind of how that product offering has evolved or does the technology has evolved because clearly -- certainly sensing a higher level of confidence that, that potentially is something near term, at least in terms of announcements, whether that means near-term deployments or not, I guess, remains to be seen.

Andrew Marsh
Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes. I would say we've gained a lot of experience, Eric, both in providing -- we have sites where we're actually powering electric vehicles. We have done some smaller backup power deployments. We do see opportunities there. I don't want to overstate the opportunities, but the products work.

We have confidence in the products. We think a lot about hydrogen all the time. And we're working with people who actually get things done. So I would just say that I don't want to -- the big growth opportunities for us is certainly electrolyzer projects that's going on around the world. Material handling next year will be core to this company's success. But I think you'll keep on seeing more and more activities associated with data centers and hydrogen as you think through how you can provide sensibly cost hydrogen to provide that critical backup.

Eric Stine
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then maybe last one for me. Just it sounds like you've obviously got a lot of confidence in getting to that gross margin positive or neutral level exiting the year. But I guess I'm unclear whether you're sticking with that. And then I also noticed in your commentary...

Andrew Marsh
Executive Chairman & CEO

So let me be clear. We're sticking with that.

Eric Stine
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

Okay. Good. All right. That's good to hear. It seemed like it, but I'm just clarifying. And then on EBITDA positive, that previously had been an end of '26 goal. And I noticed in your release that it looks like that may now be a mid-'26 goal. So maybe -- or I'm sorry, let's see target in the second half, but potentially before the end of the year. So maybe some of the drivers that are leading to that increased confidence as well?

Andrew Marsh
Executive Chairman & CEO

I think I'll let Paul answer to that one.

Paul Middleton
Executive VP, CAO & CFO

Yes. And I think we -- maybe terminology, we're focused on the second half, just given our projections and thoughts on cadence of sales and volumes and cost downs and things that we're doing. I'd say the good news is it doesn't take much movement of the needle on sales to have a meaningful effect. So our focus is to keep doing the prudent things and driving costs down and doing all the different cost initiatives we have and trying to ramp those as fast as possible.

But we definitely see continued strength in the pipeline and the efforts that we've got going on in the sales channels. And so our focus is to continue trying to pull as much of that forward as we can. So more to come, I guess, as we unfold in the next couple of quarters and see how it's tracking, but it's definitely in the art of the possible to go sooner.

But that's -- we're laser-focused on driving volumes and driving cost downs and maintaining headcount, not growing the overall resource base so that we can achieve those goals as fast as possible.

Next question is coming from Craig Irwin from ROTH Capital Partners.

Craig Irwin
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

The thing you said in the prepared remarks that got me the most excited is that your pedestal customers are moving again. Can you unpack that a little bit for us? Can you maybe explain what they're seeing or what's changed for them that has these very important customers saying it's time to buy again, grow our fleets and use more fuel cells going forward?

Andrew Marsh
Executive Chairman & CEO

So I want to start off. I think that the customers, Craig, have always loved the solution. I mean, we do help the Walmarts and Amazons move more goods, and that's the business they're in. I think that what they have seen over the past, and I can tell you with one of these customers I had deep discussions with over the last 3 months, what they have seen that Plug is actually on the right track and financially much stronger.

And third, when you look at policy, and I think all of us were presently surprised that the bill that passed in July extended the investment tax credit through 2032, which Republicans have always supported. If you go back to the last time it passed, it was under President Trump in 2018.

So they like the application. They can see that Quantum Leap is actually working. The government supports it. And they -- basically, what's always driven was they save money by using fuel cells and not using batteries. So that's why we're -- that's why they're growing. It's never been a loss of desire to use the product. I think us getting our financial house in order has dramatically changed our relationship with these customers who want to do business with us.

Craig Irwin
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

So my next question is really one of clarification. And I may be reading the tea leaves a little bit here, but your Galp commentary in the press release, 10 megawatts on the 100-megawatt project, it sounds like you could probably ship the rest of that pretty quickly. Is it possible that we see the rest of Galp shipped in the fourth quarter? Or is this something that's going to go out over the course of '26?

Jose Crespo
President, Chief Revenue Officer & GM of Material Handling

We are going to ship the majority of it before the end of the year. There's going to be -- a portion of it that is going to be shipped in Q1, mainly stacks because the stacks, we want to get them there when -- as close as possible to installation and commissioning. So you're correct. We are aiming at shipping the majority of Galp in the next couple of months.

Andrew Marsh
Executive Chairman & CEO

Jose, I think this is probably the largest real deployment in Europe.

Jose Crespo
President, Chief Revenue Officer & GM of Material Handling

The largest and real deployment in Europe right now, yes.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question today is coming from Sherif Elmaghrabi from BTIG.

Sherif Elmaghrabi
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

First on the electricity rights, are those permanently being signed over? Or some years down the road, do you have the ability to come back and use that power to produce green hydrogen?

Andrew Marsh
Executive Chairman & CEO

We are permanently signing them over. It doesn't mean that there couldn't be other relationships established, but we are permanently signing them over. And look, as I mentioned before, by showing we can build plants, we dramatically changed the competitive environment for purchasing hydrogen.

And that our goal is to continue to work with these folks and look for opportunities to deploy hydrogen where it makes sense. So -- and look, I think when you look at what this will do for our balance sheet and the fact that we're taking care -- we'll take care of a good deal of the debt overload -- overhang. I think it will be -- I think investors will see this is really will be a real good decision for the company long term.

Sherif Elmaghrabi
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

And then on the equipment side, for these plants reaching FID over the next 12 to 18 months, it sounds like mostly in Europe. Can you tell us a little more about the different sectors they're in, like oil refining, for example? And really here, I'm just hoping to get a sense of the revenue opportunity for downstream equipment.

Jose Crespo
President, Chief Revenue Officer & GM of Material Handling

So Sherif, we're getting the majority of the opportunities on green hydrogen right now on transformation from gray hydrogen in industry, especially in Europe to green hydrogen. This is the directive from the European Green Deal. So given that, what we're seeing right now is opportunities, as you mentioned, in refineries. There's a lot of opportunity there.

There's a lot of hydrogen that needs to be converted. The laws at the members' levels, at the country levels are being finalized right now, if not final already in many of the countries, and they determine the pace and the quantities of hydrogen that needs to be converted into green. So that's going to drive adoption.

Also, when you think about the same kind of concept, you have the EU moving or pushing industries like aviation and maritime towards e-fuels. So we see a lot of the opportunities also on sustainable aviation fuels and ammonia or e-methanol. So we are seeing the majority of the projects at scale in those areas in Europe and really globally. Same thing in Australia. We are working with Allied Green for an ammonia project, which is kind of the same logic. And the majority of the large projects are in that -- in those markets.

Our next question today is coming from Sameer Joshi from H.C. Wainwright.

Sameer Joshi
H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division

Jose, first of all, congratulations for the new role. Looking forward to working with you. Just a sort of follow-ups on some of the earlier questions. Of course, we have Portugal 10 megawatts and maybe a majority of the 100 megawatts going before the end of the year. And then Australia is also emerging. Given the international exposure, are you planning to deploy resources? Like are you increasing your sales presence in Europe and Australia and other regions?

Andrew Marsh
Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes. So Sameer, we have a big presence, especially in Europe already. We have probably close to 300 people in Europe -- Paul. So we have -- if you look at our product development activity, a good deal of that happens in Alphen aan den Rijn, Netherlands. If you start thinking about how we build an electrolyzer product, the products that are going to Galp, the system portion of it are actually built with one of our fabricators in the Middle East, and it's sent to Portugal and our stacks are married at the site.

We have activity in Vietnam. We have a large integrator. We have large integrators in Europe. So we do have a relatively large international footprint, both with fabricators and our own people to support the business. So we have people in the Middle East today, for example. So there's -- that footprint, we've been able to build this business because we do have a sales team in Europe. We do have a sales team in Australia. We do have salespeople in the Middle East.

So that -- we don't expect -- there may be some strategic decisions to make some expansion, but we are there already. And I think -- and more important, we can make products there already. So if you think about Galp, what we're using doesn't really have -- the Trump tariffs have almost 0 impact on us at Galp.

Sameer Joshi
H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division

Yes. No, it makes sense. On the cash and balance sheet front, of course, this transaction will provide additional cash or free up additional cash. I think when the last capital raise was completed, there was talk about paying down some of the Yorkville loan. Given all these dynamics, how long do you have a runway? I think -- is it going to extend beyond 2026 with your current cash on hand? Or how should we look at your cash burn over the next 12 to 18 months?

Paul Middleton
Executive VP, CAO & CFO

Yes. It's a good question. I guess I'd just put context that if you look over the last 2 years, the fact that each consecutive year, we continue to reduce the burn by 50% to 60%, directionally, it's going the right way, right? So when you look at next year, I mean, we haven't given exact guidance and thoughts on next year, but I would tell you, I certainly expect that trend to continue, and it should be a much more nominal amount.

And when you look at the combination of the capital that we had on our balance sheet at the end of the third quarter plus the capital raised from the recent equity transaction from an existing investor. And then you look at the $275 million targeted on this data center deal, we feel like we have more than ample capital accessible to us to bridge through that positive cash flows. So we're in a great position. And that -- we even have more if we wanted to deleverage some of that, we could. So -- and probably will work with our lenders to do that. So it's just a question of timing, but we feel like we're in a great position to navigate through that bridge and to get to a point when we get that positive cash flows.

Next question is coming from George Gianarikas from Canaccord Genuity.

George Gianarikas
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

So maybe this is for Jose Luis. I'm just curious, first, congratulations on the new role coming next year. But also, if we look to March of 2028, 2 years after you having taking the position, how do you think Plug will look different? What are the metrics by which we should sort of judge the performance of the company by then? Obviously, profitability is a big milestone, but what growth drivers do you think we should look forward to over the next couple of years that may be underestimated by us on this side of the table?

Jose Crespo
President, Chief Revenue Officer & GM of Material Handling

First, George, thank you. It's exciting to take over this new role. And on the question, 2028, well, from -- two years from now...

George Gianarikas
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

I gave you 2 years.

Paul Middleton
Executive VP, CAO & CFO

We're only giving him a few months.

Jose Crespo
President, Chief Revenue Officer & GM of Material Handling

Well, number one, the financials of the company will be in line to what we've been discussing, profitable company now being able to probably think about growth in other areas of the hydrogen market and have access to be able to finance that type of growth. We will concentrate on -- still on ELX. ELX has a lot of room to grow all the way to the end of this decade, if not beyond, and we will keep on being the leaders in that market.

And the more we deploy, the more profitable we will become. Our volumes will go higher and the profitability of the company will improve. On material handling, we will keep on growing. We were looking today at what is the available market for material handling and it is over $14 billion. And obviously, we have only started to scratching the surface on that market, right?

So as more hydrogen is available, the cost of the technology goes down, we will go deeper into that market as well. And then as you said before, and we were talking before, we kind of put a little bit of a pause on high-power stationary. But by that time, probably we will be thinking about taking a gain on that product line and thinking about growing it for applications like what we were talking before, the data center market once we understand and find solutions for the hydrogen equation on that market, and there will be a pretty substantial opportunity for growth in that market as well. So those are some of the things that you may have on the year 2028..

Andrew Marsh
Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes. I would just say a strong balance sheet, strong revenue growth in our core markets will give you opportunities to explore new applications for hydrogen and fuel cells as they evolve. It's clear that hydrogen needs to be part of the global energy solution, whether as a substitute in things like ammonia or methanol production, oil refineries. But execution over the next year will open up a whole new array of opportunities. And I'll be cheering for you as a Chairman.

George Gianarikas
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

And maybe as a follow-up, there's clearly a thawing or an increase in activity from an electrolyzer perspective in Europe. When you go into these competitive bids, what's the, I guess, top couple of reasons that you're winning? And who are you seeing from a competitive perspective?

Jose Crespo
President, Chief Revenue Officer & GM of Material Handling

So the other day, somebody asked exactly the same question to one of our customers. And the way that the customer answer was when we look at other electrolyzer companies, there is no other electrolyzer manufacturer that actually has deployed their own technology and operates the technology the way that Plug does.

That is incredibly valuable for companies that have not deployed before electrolyzers, knowing that the OEM, the partner that they're working with, in this case, Plug has done it, is doing it and is operating those plants. That is a competitive advantage that no other electrolyzer company can put on the table.

On top of that, we have deployed at scale. We are -- we've been in this market for almost three decades, and that's also really valuable. And when we start and -- when we have started to show that we can turn around the company and our financials are beginning to improve, this makes a very strong partner for anybody that is looking to deploy an electrolyzer project anywhere in the world really.

Next question is coming from Chris Senyek from Wolfe Research.

Christopher Senyek
Wolfe Research, LLC

I wanted to just clarify on Texas. Like about the DOE loan with activities pause, is that the other location for the electricity rights that was sold?

Andrew Marsh
Executive Chairman & CEO

Chris, I would love to answer the question, but I've been asked not to as part of the LOI.

Christopher Senyek
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. All right. Understood. All right. And then maybe just as you continue to shore up your balance sheet, which is starting to look better and better, could you potentially look to divest or monetize your Georgia asset or maybe even your Tennessee and Louisiana liquefaction sites?

Andrew Marsh
Executive Chairman & CEO

I don't expect to. We're going to keep operating. Those facilities give us first cost competitive hydrogen. But look, it lets people know we can deliver hydrogen ourselves and produce cost-effective hydrogen. So I think it's a healthy -- it gives us a healthy negotiating position. The fact we know how to build -- okay go ahead, Chris.

Next question today is coming from Ryan Pfingst from B. Riley Securities.

Andrew Marsh
Executive Chairman & CEO

Ryan, you're going to be my last question ever as a CEO on an earnings call.

Ryan Pfingst
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

So for the electricity rights monetization, are there other opportunities to complete similar transactions based on the assets that you have today? Or will this likely be the only announcement of this kind?

Andrew Marsh
Executive Chairman & CEO

The first question is we do have other asset. And I noticed I didn't use plural. And I don't know if it will be the last one, but we have been engaging in another asset.

Ryan Pfingst
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

Understood. Appreciate that. And then for 2025 guidance, not sure if I missed it, but are we still targeting $700 million in revenue for this year?

Andrew Marsh
Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes.

Operator

Our next question is coming from Bill Peterson from JPMorgan.

William Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Actually, probably a few sort of clarifiers or follow-ups to some of the prior questions. Maybe first on the quarter, you just reiterated that $700 million is a target. Maybe within that, sort of the puts and takes amongst the various segments you have. On the comment -- and then on gross margin neutral, I think you're probably saying that's coming off the adjusted loss of $37 million, not the GAAP loss of $120 million. So I guess, similarly, amongst your various segments, what are the puts and takes that gets you there? That's my first question. And then I'll save the last one for Andy on the second one.

Andrew Marsh
Executive Chairman & CEO

Okay. You want to go, Paul?

Paul Middleton
Executive VP, CAO & CFO

Yes. And there's three elements, Bill. One is, if you think about the math on the volume, that means it's higher volume in Q4 than Q3. So volume, particularly in equipment sales is incredibly lucrative for us. So that -- every incremental dollar of equipment sales means a lot.

Number two is we've already been making a lot of traction on service. We're trying to be prudent and thoughtful about that progression, but we expect that to continue, and that will actually provide meaningful margin enhancement in Q4 and onward just from that continued progression. It helps us in many different ways. But that's another step function change as we continue to enjoy that positive trend.

And then the last, as I talked about earlier, is fuel. We saw certainly progression in Q3. We expect to see a lot more progression in Q4 as we leverage that new platform, and we really continue to drive improvements off of our efficiencies. So those are the biggest drivers that kind of drive the levers here for Q4.

William Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Terrific. And then again, somewhat similar to some earlier lines of questions. But in the last year or so, you've been focusing primarily on materials handling. It sounds like data center is now maybe back to being an emerging application. So -- can you speak to when you may actually need to make investments to bring on new hydrogen capacity?

Would you prefer to still pursue Texas or maybe expand your supply agreements with the third parties under renegotiated terms? I guess I'm trying to get a sense at this stage, would you need to pull the trigger around Texas at some point? Or maybe it is your second site you're talking about? Or is there any other types of funding you could be considering, if not the DOE loan, which is off the table?

Andrew Marsh
Executive Chairman & CEO

So Bill, I -- when I take a look at our new agreement with the industrial gas company, when I look at opportunities Jose has been developing for folks who are looking to build plants, we're going to be strategic and thoughtful about when we build next. I don't foresee a need in the immediate future. We've spent a lot of time looking at this, and we sat down and we thought about it from a financial performance point of view.

It feels -- quite honestly, Bill, it feels really good to hand off to Jose and Paul a balance sheet that works. We've discussed a lot over the last year about Quantum Leap being improving the income statement. But look, Jose is going to be and Paul are going to have essentially 0 debt. We -- between the $150 million we ended with the $360 million, the $350 million we raised this activity, we're going to focus on let's get our debt down.

And I look in and I want to position them. So -- and we want to position because we're doing this as a team, be position that next year, when Jose goes to see customers, he can say to them, look how strong my balance sheet is, look how strong my income statement is. And as I mentioned earlier in the call, people want to buy from us.

And a strong balance sheet will make it a lot easier. And for every electrolyzer dollar Jose sells, it really contributes $0.30 to $0.40 to the bottom line every dollar. So I think the company is much healthier. And with Jose's leadership, I think the company will continue to expand. And I think growth is tied very, very tightly to this balance sheet. And now it's going to be a much, much better balance sheet.

William Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I appreciate that, Andy. I appreciate the dialogue in the past several years. I look forward to following the progress and look forward to hearing more about the strategy in a few weeks -- or actually next week.

Andrew Marsh
Executive Chairman & CEO

Good end for us, Bill, because I need to remind folks, you can register for digitally for the listening to the Plug Symposium. It's an exciting event. We have many -- what customers are going to be here, Teal?

Teal Vivacqua Hoyos
Director of Marketing Communications

Probably a lots of customers. We'll be showcasing our electrolyzers with customers like Arcadia. We have customers like Amazon and Uline presenting on customer panels. So we'll have lots of customer showcase throughout the different panels we're excited about that.

Andrew Marsh
Executive Chairman & CEO

I am excited, and I know the team has put a lot of effort in, and we really want to show folks all the great progress Plug has made to date, but probably more important, where Jose is going to take us in the future. So thank you, everybody.

Jose Crespo
