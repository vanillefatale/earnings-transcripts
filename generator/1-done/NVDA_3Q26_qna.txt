[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.

Joseph Moore
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I wonder if you could update us, you talked about the $500 billion of revenue for Blackwell plus Rubin in '25 and '26 at GTC. At that time, you talked about $150 billion of that already having been shipped. So as the quarter is wrapped up, are those still kind of the general parameters that there's $350 billion in the next kind of 14 months or so. And I would assume over that time, you haven't seen all the demand that there is, there's any possibility of upside to those numbers as we move forward.

Colette Kress
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Joe. I'll start first with a response here on that. Yes, that's correct. We are working into our $500 billion forecast. And we are on track for that as we have finished some of the quarters, and now we have several quarters now in front of us to take us through the end of calendar year '26. The number will grow. And we will achieve, I'm sure, additional needs for compute that will be shippable by fiscal year '26. So we shipped $50 billion this quarter but we would be not finished if we didn't say that we'll probably be taking more orders.

For example, just even today, our announcements with KSA. And that agreement in itself is 400,000 to 600,000 more GPUs over 3 years. Anthropic is also net new. So there's definitely an opportunity for us to have more on top of the $500 billion that we announced.

The next question comes from CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald.

Christopher Muse
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

There's clearly a great deal of consternation around the magnitude of AI infrastructure build-outs and the ability to fund such plans and the ROI yet, at the same time, you're talking about being sold out, every stood up GP is taken. The AI world hasn't seen the enormous benefit yet from B300, never mind Rubin, and Gemini 3 just announced Grok 5 coming soon. And so the question is this, when you look at that as the backdrop do you see a realistic path for supply to catch up with demand over the next 12 to 18 months? Or do you think it can extend beyond that time frame?

Jen-Hsun Huang
Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director

Well, as you know, we've done a really good job planning our supply chain. NVIDIA supply chain basically includes every technology company in the world. And TSMC and their packaging and our memory vendors -- memory partners and all of our system ODMs have done a really good job planning with us. And we were planning for a big year. We've seen for some time, the 3 transitions that I spoke about just a second ago, accelerated computing from general-purpose computing. And it's really important to recognize that AI is not just agentic AI but generative AI is transforming the way that hyperscalers did the work that they used to do on CPUs.

Generative AI made it possible for them to move search and recommender systems and ad recommendations and targeting, all of that has been moved to generative AI and still transitioning. And so whether you install NVIDIA GPUs for data processing or you did it for generative AI for your recommender system or you're building it for agentic chatbots and the type of AIs that most people see when they think about AI, all of those applications are accelerated by NVIDIA. And so when you -- when you look at the totality of the spend, it's really important to think about each 1 of those layers. They're all growing. They're related, but not the same, but the wonderful thing is that they all run on NVIDIA GPUs.

Simultaneously, because the quality of the AI models are improving so incredibly. The adoption of it in the different use cases, whether it's in code assistance, which NVIDIA uses fairly exhaustively, and we're not the only one. I mean, the fastest-growing application in history, a combination of Cursor and Claude Code and code -- OpenAI's Codex and GitHub CoPilot. These applications are the fastest-growing in history. And it's not just used for software engineers. It's used by because of wide coding is used by engineers and marketeers all over companies, supply chain planners, all over companies.

And so I think that that's just 1 example, and the list goes on, whether it's OpenEvidence and the work that they do in health care or the work that's being done in digital video editing, Runway in -- I mean a number of really, really exciting start-ups that are taking advantage of generative AI and agentic AI is growing quite rapidly. And not to mention we're all using it a lot more.

And so all of these exponentials , not to mention just today, I was reading a text from Denis. And he was saying that pre-training and post training are fully intact. And Gemini 3 takes advantage of the scaling laws and got to receive a huge jump in quality performance -- model performance. And so we're seeing all of these exponentials kind of running at the same time. And just always go back to first principles and think about what's happening from each one of the dynamics that I mentioned before, general purpose computing to accelerated computing, generative AI replacing classical machine learning and, of course, agentic AI, which is a brand-new category.

The next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.

Vivek Arya
BofA Securities, Research Division

I'm curious, what assumptions are you making on NVIDIA content per gigawatt in that $500 billion number? Because we have heard numbers as low as $25 billion per gigawatt of content to as high as $30 billion or $40 billion per gigawatt. So I'm curious what power and what dollar per gig assumptions you are making as part of that $500 billion number.

And then longer term, Jensen, the $3 trillion to $4 trillion in data center by 2030 was mentioned. How much of that do you think will require vendor financing? And how much of that can be supported by cash flows of your large customers or governments or enterprises?

Jen-Hsun Huang
Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director

In each generation, from Ampere to Hopper, from Hopper to Blackwell, Blackwell to Rubin, our part of the data center increases. And Hopper generation was probably something along the lines of 20-some-odd, 20 to 25. Blackwell generation, Grace Blackwell particularly is probably 30 to 30 to say, 30 plus or minus and then Rubin is probably higher than that.

And in each one of these generations, the speed up is X factors. And therefore, their TCO, the customer TCO, improves by X factors, and the most important thing is, in the end, you still only have 1 gigawatt of power. One gigawatt data centers, 1 gigawatt power. And therefore, performance per watt, the efficiency of your architecture is incredibly important. And the efficiency of your architecture can't be brute force. There is no brute forcing about it.

That 1 gigawatt translates directly. Your performance per watt translates directly absolutely directly to your revenues, which is the reason why choosing the right architecture matters so much now. The world doesn't have an excess of anything to squander. And so we have to be really, really -- we use this concept called codesign across our entire stack, across the frameworks and models, across the entire data center, even power and cooling, optimized across the entire supply chain or ecosystem.

And so each generation, our economic contribution will be greater. Our value delivered will be greater but the most important thing is our energy efficiency per watt is going to be extraordinary, every single generation. With respect to growing into -- continuing to grow, our customers' financing is up to them. We are -- we see the opportunity to grow for quite some time. And remember, today, most of the focus has been on the hyperscalers.

And one of the areas that is really misunderstood about the hyperscalers is that the investment on NVIDIA GPUs not only improves their scale, speed and cost for -- from general purpose computing. That's number 1, because Moore's Law saw scaling has really slowed. Moore's Law is about driving cost down. It's about deflationary cost, the incredible deflationary cost of computing over time. But that has slowed. Therefore, a new approach is necessary for them to keep driving the cost down. Going to NVIDIA GPU computing is really the best way to do so.

The second is revenue boosting in their current business models, recommender systems drive the world's hyperscalers. Every single -- whether it's watching short-form videos or recommending books or recommending the next item in your basket to recommending ads to recommending news to -- it's all about recommenders. The world has -- the Internet has trillions of pieces of content, how could they possibly figure out what to put in front of you and your little tiny screen, unless they have really sophisticated recommender systems to do so.

Well, that has gone generative AI, so the first 2 things that I've just said, hundreds of billions of dollars of CapEx that's going to have to be invested is fully cash flow funded. What is above it, therefore, is agentic AI. This is revenue -- this is net new, net new consumption, but it's also net new applications and some of the applications I mentioned before, but these are -- these new applications are also the fastest-growing applications in history, okay? So I think that you're going to see that once people start to appreciate what is actually happening under the water, if you will, from the simplistic view of what's happening to CapEx investment, recognizing there's these 3 dynamics.

And then lastly, remember, we were just talking about the American CSPs. Each country will fund their own infrastructure. And you have multiple countries, you have multiple industries. Most of the world's industries haven't really engaged agentic AI yet, and they're about to. All the names of companies that you know we're working with, whether it's autonomous vehicle companies or digital twins for physical AI for factories and the number of factories and warehouses being built around the world, just a number of digital biology start-ups that are being funded so that we could accelerate drug discovery. All of those different industries are now getting engaged, and they're going to do their own fundraising. And so don't just look at the hyperscalers as a way to build out for the future. You got to look at the world, you got to look at all the different industries and enterprise computing is going to fund their own industry.

The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius.

Benjamin Reitzes
Melius Research LLC

Jensen, I wanted to ask you about cash. Speaking of $0.5 trillion, you may generate about $0.5 trillion in free cash flow over the next couple of years. What are your plans for that cash? How much goes to buyback versus investing in the ecosystem? And how do you look at investing in the ecosystem? I think there's just a lot of confusion out there about how these deals work and your criteria for doing those like the Anthropic, the OpenAI's, et cetera.

Jen-Hsun Huang
Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director

Yes, I appreciate the question. Of course, using cash to fund our growth, no company has grown at the scale that we're talking about and have the connection and the depth and the breadth of supply chain that NVIDIA has. The reason why our entire customer base can rely on us is because we've secured a really resilient supply chain, and we have the balance sheet to support them.

When we make purchases, our suppliers can take it to the bank. When we make forecast and we plan with them, they take us seriously because of our balance sheet. We're not making up the offtake. We know what our offtake is, and because they've been planning with us for so many years, our reputation and our credibility is incredible. And so it takes really strong balance sheet to do that, to support the level of growth and the rate of growth and the magnitude associated with that. So that's number one.

The second thing, of course, we're going to continue to do stock buybacks. We're going to continue to do that. But with respect to the investments, this is really, really important work that we do. All of the investments that we've done so far, all the period, is associated with expanding the reach of CUDA expanding the ecosystem. If you look at the work that -- the investments that we did with OpenAI, it's -- of course, that relationship we've had since 2016, I delivered the first AI supercomputer ever made to OpenAI. And so we've had a close and wonderful relationship with OpenAI since then. And everything that OpenAI does runs on NVIDIA today. So all the clouds that they deploy in, whether it's training and inference runs NVIDIA and we love working with them.

The partnership that we have with them is one, so that we could work even deeper from a technical perspective so that we could support their accelerated growth. This is a company that's growing incredibly fast. And don't just look at what is said in the press, look at all the ecosystem partners and all the developers that are connected to OpenAI, and they're all driving consumption of it. and the quality of the AI that's being produced, huge step-up since a year ago. And so the quality of response is extraordinary.

So we invest in OpenAI for a deep partnership in co-development to expand our ecosystem and support their growth. And of course, rather than giving up a share of our company, we get a share of their company. And we invested in them, in one of the most consequential once-in-a-generation companies that we have a share of. And so I fully expect that investment to translate to extraordinary returns.

Now in the case of Anthropic, this is the first time that Anthropic will be on NVIDIA's architecture. The first time Anthropic will be on NVIDIA's architecture is the second most successful AI in the world in terms of total number of users. But in enterprise, they're doing incredibly well. Claude Code is doing incredibly well. Claude Code is doing incredibly well all of the world's enterprise. And now we have the opportunity to have a deep partnership with them and bringing Claude onto the NVIDIA platform.

And so what do we have now? NVIDIA's architecture, taking a step back, NVIDIA's architecture, NVIDIA's platform is the singular platform in the world that runs every AI model. We run OpenAI, we run Anthropic, we run xAI because of our deep partnership with Elon and xAI, we were able to bring that opportunity to Saudi Arabia to the KSA so that HUMAIN could also be hosting opportunity for xAI. We run xAI, we run Gemini, we run Thinking Machines, let's see, what else do we run? We've run them all. And so not to mention, we run the science models, the biology models, DNA models, gene models, chemical models and all the different fields around the world. It's not just cognitive AI that the world uses, AI is impacting every single industry.

And so we have the ability to the ecosystem investments that we make to partner with -- deeply partner on a technical basis with some of the best companies, most brilliant companies in the world, we are expanding the reach of our ecosystem, and we're getting a share and investment in what will be a very successful company, oftentimes once in a generation company. And so that basic -- that's our investment thesis.

The next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.

James Schneider
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

In the past, you've talked about roughly 40% of your shipments tied to AI inference. I'm wondering, as you look forward into next year, where do you expect that percentage could go in, say, a year's time? And can you maybe address the Rubin CPX product you expect to introduce next year or contextualize that, how big of the overall TAM you expect that can take? And maybe talk about some of the target customer applications for that specific product.

Jen-Hsun Huang
Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director

CPX is designed for long context type of workload generation. And so long context, basically, before you start generating answers, you have to read a lot, basically long context. And it could be a bunch of PDFs. It could be watching a bunch of videos, studying 3D images, so on and so forth. You have to absorb the context. And so CPX is designed for a long context type of workloads. And it's perf-per-dollar excellent, it's perf-per-watt is excellent. And which -- maybe forget the first part of the question...

Colette Kress
Executive VP & CFO

Inferencing...

Jen-Hsun Huang
Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director

Oh inferencing, yes, there are 3 scaling laws that are scaling at the same time. The first scaling law called pretraining continues to be very effective. And the second is post-training. Post-training basically has found incredible algorithms for improving an AI's ability to break a problem down and solve a problem step by step. And post-training is scaling exponentially, basically, the more compute you apply to a model, the smarter it is, the more intelligent it is. And then the third is inference. Inference because of chain of thought, because of reasoning capabilities, AIs are essentially reading, thinking before it answers. And the amount of computation necessary as a result of those 3 things has gone completely exponential. I think that it's hard to know exactly what the percentage of it will be at any given point in time and who.

But of course, our hope is that inference is a very large part of the market because if inference is large, then what it suggests is that people are using it in more applications and they're using it more frequently. And that's -- we should all hope for inference to be very large. And this is where Grace Blackwell is just an order of magnitude better more advanced than anything in the world.

The second best platform is H200, and it's very clear now that GB300, GB200and GB300 because of NVLink 72, the scale-up network that we have achieved. And you saw and Colette talked about in the semi analysis benchmark. It's the largest single inference benchmark ever done and GB200, NVLink 72 is 10x, 10 to 15x higher performance. And so that's a big step up. It's going to take a long time before somebody is able to take that on. And our leadership there is surely multiyear. And so I think I'm hoping that inference becomes a very big deal. Our leadership in inference is extraordinary.

The next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.

Timothy Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Jensen, many of your customers are pursuing behind-the-meter power, but like what's the single biggest bottleneck that worries you that could constrain your growth? Is it power? Or maybe it's financing or maybe it's something else like memory or even foundry?

Jen-Hsun Huang
Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director

Well, these are all issues and they're all constraints. And the reason for that, when you're growing at the rate that we are and the scale that we are, how could anything be easy? What NVIDIA is doing obviously has never been done before. And we've created a whole new industry.

Now on the one hand, we are transitioning computing from general purpose and classical or traditional computing to accelerated computing and AI. That's on the one hand. On the other hand, we created a whole new industry called AI factories. The idea that in order for software to run, you need these factories to generate it, generate every single token instead of retrieving information that was pre-created. And so -- so I think this whole transition requires extraordinary scale. And all the way from the supply chain. Of course, the supply chain, we have much better visibility and control over because obviously, we're incredibly good at managing our supply chain. We have great partners that we've worked with for 33 years.

And so the supply chain part of it, we're quite confident. Now looking down our supply chain, we've now established partnerships with so many players in land and power and shell. And of course, financing. These things -- none of these things are easy, but they're all attractable and they're all solvable things. And the most important thing that we have to do is do a good job planning we plan up the supply chain, down the supply chain. We have established a whole lot of partners. And so we have a lot of routes to market. And very importantly, our architecture has to deliver the best value to the customers that we have.

And so at this point, I'm very confident that NVIDIA's architecture is the best performance per TCO, it is the best performance per watt. And therefore, for any amount of energy that is delivered, our architecture will drive the most revenues. And I think the increasing rate of our success, I think that we're more successful this year at this point than we were last year at this point. The number of customers coming to us and the number of platforms coming to us after they've explored others, is increasing, not decreasing. And so I think the -- I think all of that is just -- all the things that I've been telling you over the years are really coming -- are coming through or becoming evident.

The next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.

Stacy Rasgon
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Colette, I have some questions on margins. You said for next year, you're working to hold them in the mid-70s. So I guess, first of all, what are the biggest cost increases? Is it just memory or is it something else? What are you doing to work toward that? Is it -- how much is like cost optimizations versus prebuys versus pricing? And then also, how should we think about OpEx growth next year, given the revenues seem likely to grow materially from where we're running right now?

Colette Kress
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Stacy. Let me see if I can start with remembering where we were with the current fiscal year that we're in. Remember, earlier this year, we indicated that through cost improvements and mix that we would exit the year in our gross margins in the mid 70s. We've achieved that and getting ready to also execute that in Q4. So now it's time for us to communicate where are we working right now in terms of next year.

Next year, there are input prices that are well known in the industries that we need to work through. And our systems are by no means very easy to work with. There are tremendous amount of components in many different parts of it as we think about that. So we're taking all of that into account, but we do believe as we look at working again on cost improvement, cycle time and mix that we will work to try and hold at our gross margins in the mid-70s. So that's our overall plan for gross margin.

Your second question is around OpEx. And right now, our goal in terms of OpEx is to really make sure that we are innovating with our engineering teams with all of our business teams to create more and more systems for this market. As you know, right now, we have a new architecture coming out. And that means they are quite busy in order to meet that goal. And so we're going to continue to see our investments on innovating more and more both the software, both our systems and our hard work to do so. I'll leave it -- turn it to Jensen if he wants to add any couple of more comments.

Jen-Hsun Huang
Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director

Yes, that's spot on. I think the only thing that I would add is remember that we plan, we forecast, we plan and we negotiate with our supply chain well in advance. Our supply chain have known for quite a long time, our requirements. And they've known for quite a long time our demand, and we've been working with them and negotiating with them for quite a long time. And so I think the recent surge obviously quite significant.

But remember, our supply chain has been working with us for a very long time. So in many cases, we've secured a lot of supply for ourselves because, obviously, they're working with the largest company in the world in doing so. And we've also been working closely with them on the financial aspects of it and securing forecasts and plans and so on and so forth. So I think all of that has worked out well for us.

Your final question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.

Aaron Rakers
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Jensen, the question for you. As you think about the Anthropic deal that was announced and just the overall breadth of your customers, I'm curious if your thoughts around the role that AI ASICs or dedicated XPUs play in these architecture build-outs has changed at all? Have you seen, I think you've been fairly adamant in the past that some of these programs never really see deployments. But I'm curious if we're at a point where maybe that's even changed more in favor of just GPU architecture.

Jen-Hsun Huang
Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thank you very much, and I really appreciate the question. So first of all, you're not competing against teams -- excuse me, against a company, you're competing against teams. And the -- there just aren't that many teams in the world who are built -- who are extraordinary at building these incredibly complicated things.

Back in the Hopper day and the Ampere days, we would build one GPU. That's the definition of an accelerated AI system. But today, we've got to build entire racks entire -- 3 different types of switches, scale up, scale out and scale across switch. And it takes a lot more than 1 chip to build a compute node anymore. Everything about that computing system because AI needs to have memory, AI didn't use to have memory at all. Now it has to remember things, the amount of memory and context it has is gigantic. The memory architecture implication is incredible. The diversity of models from mixture of experts to dense models, to diffusion models that are aggressive not to mention biological models that are based on the laws of physics, the list of different types of models have exploded in the last several years.

And so the challenge is the complexity of the problem is much higher. The diversity of AI models is incredibly, incredibly large. And so this is where, if I will say, there are 5 things that makes us special, if you will. The first thing I would say that makes us special is that we accelerate every phase of that transition. That's the first space. CUDA allows us to have CUDA-X for transitioning from general purpose to accelerated computing. We are incredibly good at generative AI. We're incredibly good at agentic AI. So every single phase of that -- every single layer of the transition, we are excellent at. You can invest in 1 architecture, use it across the board. You can use 1 architecture and not worry about the changes in the workload across those 3 phases. That's number one.

Number two, we're excellent at every phase of AI. Everybody's always known that we're incredibly good at pretraining. We're obviously very good at post-training, and we're incredibly good, as it turns out at inference because inference is really, really hard. How could thinking be easy? People think that inference is one shot and therefore, it's easy, anybody could approach the market that way. But it turns out to be the hardest of all because thinking as it turns out is quite hard. We're great at every phase of AI, the second thing.

The third thing is we're now the only architecture in the world that runs every AI model, every frontier AI model, we run open source AI models incredibly well. We run science models, biology models, robotics models. We run every single model. We're the only architecture in the world that can claim that. It doesn't matter whether you're auto regressive or diffusion based. We run everything and we run it for every major platform, as I just mentioned. So we run every model.

And then the fourth thing I would say is that we're in every cloud. The reason why developers love us is because we're literally everywhere. We're in every cloud, we're in every -- we can even make you a little tiny cloud called DGX Spark. And so we're in every computer, we're everywhere, from cloud to on-prem to robotic systems, edge devices, PCs, you name it. One architecture, things just work, it's incredible.

And then the last thing, and this is probably the most important thing, the fifth thing is, if you are a cloud service provider, if you're a new company like HUMAIN, if you're a new company like CoreWeave or Nscale or Nebius or OCI for that matter, the reason why NVIDIA is the best platform for you is because our offtake is so diverse. We can help you with offtake. It's not about just putting a random ASIC into a data center. Where is the offtake coming from? Where is the diversity coming from? Where is the resilience coming from? The versatility of the architecture coming from, the diversity of capability coming from, NVIDIA has such incredibly good offtake because our ecosystem is so large. So these 5 things, every phase of acceleration and transition every phase of AI, every model, every cloud to on-prem. And of course, finally, it all leads to offtake.
