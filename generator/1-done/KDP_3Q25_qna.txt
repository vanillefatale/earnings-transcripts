Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome members of Keurig Dr Pepper's Board of Directors and management team to the stage.

Chethan Mallela

Thank you. I hope you enjoyed that break. We're able to try some of our great beverages. I will now move to a Q&A session with the panel. So we're happy to take your questions. Dara?

Timothy Cofer
CEO & Director

Dara, right here in the front row, [ Katie ].

Dara Mohsenian
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So, Tim, it's been a couple of months now since you announced the transaction. Just can you give us an update as you've done more detailed work and look more under the hood at any incremental opportunities as you see it on the JDE side as you've looked at the business the last couple of months? And specifically on the cost synergy side, potential maybe for upside there, level of visibility that you can deliver the savings you outlined?

And then just secondly, on the base KDP business today, can you just give us an update on the tariff situation? What's embedded in '26 guidance? How we should think about incrementality in '27? But also really wanted to understand how you're managing pricing on both the coffee side as well as the CSD side, given what we're seeing with tariffs and the volatility there.

Timothy Cofer
CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Dara. I'll start. And Roger, I might kick it to you on cost synergies and then I can come back on the tariff and cost outlook. Look, over the last 8 weeks, as I said, I've spent a lot of time with our colleagues at JDE Peet's multiple trips into Amsterdam, et cetera. You can imagine we did a great deal of due diligence prior to announcing this acquisition. But at some point, that's kind of public company due diligence. So now being able to really get underneath the hood, meet the leadership team, review things like brand plans, early thoughts on innovation and so on.

What I'm seeing is, number one, this is a good business. These are good bones, the brands, the positions, et cetera. And you saw a lot of supporting evidence on stage earlier today. I think the other is improved confidence in our synergies, both on a revenue basis in terms of the growth opportunities everything from what we can do on the brewer side, one of many towering strengths of legacy Keurig is our brewer know-how, our brewer innovation, our brewer cost structure and our brewer economics. And having seen the other side brewers and having run one of those businesses in my past life, I think there's real benefits there.

I think a lot of the -- take Keurig legacy brands, think of Green Mountain and a Donut Shop and take it across all formats now in a more profitable way, that's an opportunity for us. Then we start talking about things like Alta, et cetera. So I'm -- the more that I learn, the more excited I am on the base business itself, the early stages of the Reignite the Amazing strategy that, that team is embarking upon as well as the synergies.

You want to talk a little more on cost, Roger?

Roger Johnson
Chief Transformation & Supply Chain Officer

Yes. So in the remarks that I had, we talked about from a cost side, procurement, manufacturing, logistics and SG&A and IT. And after the diligence work concluded, kind of had a chance to dive in deeper and really start to underpin that, right? Learn more about the Reignite the Amazing and then see what's complementary. And I'd echo what Tim said around maybe more obvious things, brewers or otherwise. But then things about manufacturing footprint, routes to market and associated IT systems that I would -- I have confidence as we're building out the plans as best we can as 2 separate companies that I'm confident in it. And then we'll get into the clean rooms a little more detail over the next couple of weeks to substantially underpin those more.

Timothy Cofer
CEO & Director

And then on tariff, lastly and then next, Kevin, looks like is -- look, first of all, unique to U.S., right? So it's not a global impact here for the others. No doubt that cost pressure is a back half '25, early '26 phenomenon. So that pressure will continue into that.

As part of your phrasing the question, what's built into '26 guidance? There is no '26 guidance. That's not the purpose of today. You guys know we have an algorithm. That's an algorithm that we feel strongly about. But today is not the day for '26 guidance. I will tell you, cost pressure will continue to mount in Q4 and carry over into the front half of next year.

Kevin Grundy
BNP Paribas Exane, Research Division

Great. Kevin Grundy, BNP Paribas. Two questions, just kind of taking a step back. Strategically with respect to the deal, maybe just spend a moment on the structure of the deal and why the Board believed it made more sense than potentially a spin or sale of the coffee business where you still get sort of the strategic focus that, that sort of transaction would lend itself to?

And then relatedly, what learnings does the Board take from this and the market reaction in terms of the way you think about capital allocation, communication with your large shareholders and things of that nature? I'd appreciate your thoughts.

Robert Gamgort

Okay. I'll start off from there. Yes. I think -- I mean, Kevin, I think we were incredibly transparent in one of the slides that Tim had today that said we contemplated all potential alternatives, status quo, selling, spinning and then this combination here. And we analyzed each one of those and looked at the potential value creation from that. The problem with selling it is that you need a party on the other side who's willing to buy it and buy it at a price that you think is fair. And this is a really large asset.

Spinning it off on its own does nothing. It weakens the business. It's -- I talked about before about creating a scale player on a global basis. Spinning off Keurig on its own is one that we thought would have destroyed value, and we would have lost a lot of the synergies and the scale that we get as a combined company.

Theoretically, to one of the questions, I think we were talking at a break that you could spin it and then merge it at some point in time. Well, that's an unknown. You're not actually not allowed to spin it tax-free and have a pre-negotiated deal, so we couldn't do that. And then you're left with a lot of uncertainty. And some of these spin, sale conversations are because there are a group of investors, and I understand it, who think that coffee is a problem. They don't like the coffee business. We actually do like the coffee business. And we, as a Board, are responsible for creating value across our portfolio. So separating it so that people could come in and buy the refreshment beverage business and then let the coffee business language out there is not the Board's responsibility.

And so when we took a look at all of the possibilities, we firmly believe, and you see that today, that the combination of KDP's coffee business anchored by Keurig and JDE Peet's is a perfect match. These are complementary businesses that create a real global leader in coffee. And this was the way that we chose to get there.

I don't know. Can Pamela, take the second part in terms of lessons from the Board or build on that one before I take this over too much?

Pamela Patsley

No, that's okay. I'll take the easy part. We did learn a lot. And otherwise, we wouldn't be here again today almost just 2 months after some of us spoke to you all the first time. And I think taking time and we did have a lot of outside advisers, as you would expect, all summer long, spring, summer. We solicited other input, other advisers. And certainly, everyone in this room also was listened to and was heard. And so I think I'm not sure there'll ever be another one of just this thing again. But so that part is definitely a learning.

I will emphasize what Bob said that -- and you heard it both from Bob and Tim in the more formal remarks that we did consider a lot of alternatives. And along that way, because we've heard feedback about JAB and question marks about that, when we were doing some of that strategic analysis, survey of the market, survey of alternatives, whenever it involved JDE Peet's or something, we had a separate committee of the Board of disinterested and independent directors. So that feedback and survey part of the market always went to just that group.

So I feel very good about our governance, our rigor around governance and our respect of independence and competing interest. I think we've done a very good job. But there's no question, maybe just taking our time a little bit would -- slowing a few decisions down would be the biggest takeaway in terms of learnings. I hope that was helpful.

Christopher Carey
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Chris Carey, Wells Fargo. Two questions, please. First, on the free cash flow outlook, 2026 to 2028. Is this a view on free cash flow conversion? Or are you implicitly giving any expectations for net income growth in that time frame? I'm conscious that the algorithms that you've laid out today are longer term, but are you also underwriting high single digits over 2026 to 2028 for those 2 businesses from an earnings growth perspective? So perhaps you can give any context on that. I mean, obviously, we've gotten concrete expectations for 2026 to 2028 free cash flow. That's why I'm kind of testing that.

The second thing would be, in what backdrops would you tap into these additional financing paths, if you will, right, beverage IPO, selling of minority stakes, green coffee inflation is going to carry into the front half of next year. Potentially that has EBITDA risks. Okay, if EBITDA comes in a bit lower, now we finance -- or we tap into these financings. What are the thresholds by which those become near-term realities, so the free cash flow and then the financing?

Timothy Cofer
CEO & Director

I think most of you in this room know Jane and know her well. She's our Head of IR and CFO International. But in addition, over the last few months, Jane has jumped into an expanded role as SVP of Strategic Finance and Capital Markets. And I think, Jane, you're well-placed to answer Chris' two questions.

Jane Gelfand
Vice President of Investor Relations & Strategic Initiatives

Thanks for teeing me up the questions, Tim. Good questions, Chris. So first on free cash flow. What -- our goal and objective for today is to give you more clarity, more data points against which to plan and model and just understand better what we mean by the vision for Beverage Co. and Global Coffee Co.

In doing so, we thought it would be prudent to give you a view of what we think the cash generation potential of each of those businesses is over the next several years rather than pinning you down to any particular year. And so what I would interpret the over $6 billion for Bev Co. and over $5 billion for Global Coffee Co. in free cash flow generation to be is truly a 3-year view, and we will unpack that as we go forward, as we give you more perspective on 2026 specifically. But I think what you're hearing us do is try and give you a view as we operate as a combined company into each of the pieces because we know ultimately, that will be what you are -- we're all marching towards.

Then anyone else want to chime in on alternatives? Otherwise, I'll take it. So look, what we've done here over the last several weeks is take a fresh look at the financing, right, and make sure that we're solving for the things that we know are important for the company and for shareholders, which is a balance sheet that is solid and visibility to balance sheets that are appropriate for the individual pieces. I think we've done that very successfully today, moving your point of view from 5.6x to 4.6x at transaction close, assuming June 2026.

You also have a view of what the deleveraging potential is of the business, right, at about 0.5 turn a year. So very quickly, you see that particularly with a muscle that we already have proven over time around emphasizing cash flow generation, we can get to a blended point for net leverage that gives us real visibility to that separation.

Now businesses naturally are variable, markets are variable, conditions change. And so what you should expect us to do is to evaluate all of our options, right? To build on what Pam said, like the lesson is you got to be flexible. You know where you're marching. You got to get there in a value-maximizing way. And what you're hearing from us is that there is a set of potential options and levers we could pursue, but we will only pursue those if we believe they unlock maximum value and better outcomes for the business.

Chethan Mallela

Andrea?

Andrea Teixeira
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So, Andrea Teixeira, JPMorgan. So my question is on the synergies. I understand that the $400 million is on top of the EUR 500 million from the JDEP, and we have the details for the JDEP. Obviously, there is a lot of kind of optimization of the brands and facilities as well. So I was hoping to see out of that $400 million, I understand, Tim, you said a lot of this is SG&A. But thinking of like how the hedging of the commodities and procurement can be with -- to all of these. And then I understand JDEP has a very strong capability for hedging. So thinking of how that can be linked and how conservative were you setting that guidance of $400 million and how to think as investors?

Timothy Cofer
CEO & Director

Thanks, Andrea. Let's -- first, I want to just clarify the baseline here, and then I'll ask Roger to build from his unique position, both as Head of Supply Chain and Procurement and Chief Transformation Officer.

For clarity to Andrea's question, the JDE Peet's cost-out program is EUR 500 million over 7 years, half of which will be reinvested in the business. The acquisition integration synergies are $400 million over 3 years as a result of the combination. And we have spent a great deal of time leading up to the acquisition announcement first at a high level. And in the last 8 weeks at a far more detailed level as we've kicked off this transformation management office and with external advisers as well who have worked with both our company and JDE Peet's company to comfort ourselves that those 2 numbers over those 2 time frames are incremental.

Roger, what else would you say on Andreas double-click?

Roger Johnson
Chief Transformation & Supply Chain Officer

Yes. So from a building the -- to the extent we can, right, understanding the -- each of the programs, right, and independent programs, I think we've arrived at a good place where we have confidence in the underpinnings. We always reserve the right to get smarter, but one of the principles we have is best of both, right? And really bringing that to light as we're really underpinning the plans. Again, the next step is to get into the clean room and understand detailed policies and what have you.

The coffee market is a fairly efficient market on its own. And I think there's other opportunities there as we look at the capabilities, whether it's technology, whether it's development or what have you, to really bring some flexibility to unlock further places to look, specifically around coffee formulation and what have you. And so I'm looking forward to the next couple of weeks of getting into that. I'll be in Amsterdam next week to start that process of going into the next click of it.

But to date, what we've seen is underpinning the numbers in a way that we feel confident, and we reserve the right to accelerate that more and drive where we see opportunities. We know we have to phase it. We know we have to make choices, right? We can't do everything all at once. But sitting here today, I have confidence in that number. And then as we learn more about policies and how to action those numbers, we'll come back to you with the schedules after we build them.

Chethan Mallela

Let's go Peter Grom, and then Filippo.

Peter Grom
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Peter Grom from UBS. So, 2 coffee questions, just maybe a follow-up on that. So the long-term algorithm of low single-digit top line growth into high single-digit EPS growth, is that inclusive of the synergies? Or are there other factors that drive that degree of operating leverage?

And then just on the business itself, so just ball mix for coffee this quarter, it didn't really change that much sequentially despite pricing stepping higher. So how much of that is actually the mix component versus shipments actually holding stable? And then just on elasticities, how are you thinking about that through the balance of the year?

Timothy Cofer
CEO & Director

Yes. I can start. I think the first answer is inclusive. Obviously, that's near term. That's a long-term algorithm. Near term, that's an enabler for that.

On the coffee quarter, the second question, do you want to take that, Jane or Olivier?

Jane Gelfand
Vice President of Investor Relations & Strategic Initiatives

I'll start and Olivier, if you want to add. I had a conversation with some of you offline about, hey, what gives you confidence in the coffee category recovery. And I think if you zoom out, right, we've had a couple of years now of sequential volume improvement. We're not where we expect to be longer term. But this year and the year-to-date experience, I think, would be very supportive of this trend, right? There is record pricing in the market because we have record sea prices. And yet despite that, what we are seeing is very manageable elasticity.

So to answer your question specifically, Peter, you did see some volume trade-off as more pricing was enacted in the market. At the same time, you had favorable mix. within that sort of U.S. coffee segment. I will say that pods are quite resilient. You are seeing more elasticity on the brewers, but that would have been expected.

Chethan Mallela

Filippo, go ahead.

Filippo Falorni
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Filippo Falorni, Citi. So going back to the coffee category more long term. Bob and Tim, you talked both about the attractiveness of the category. Maybe can you expand a little bit more on the rationale of the deal? Why was coffee the best category to double down compared to maybe some of the fastest growth categories within beverages? And even from a long-term standpoint, like we've seen some of the categories taking some share in terms of caffeine consumption like energy drinks. So what gives you the confidence that, that 2% 40-year CAGR is still kind of the right trajectory?

Robert Gamgort

Given that I've been around for 40 years, I'll start with the last one. I seem to be an expert on that, and then Tim is going to talk about the piece about the second -- the first part of the question. So I'm going to go back to 1985 in that case study. You know what the case study was, was how do you fix the coffee category given that everyone at below a certain age is switching to diet Coke? That was the case that was on campus in 1985. And so the point is there are always the short-term trends where categories are challenged by new formats, new varieties. But that's why it's always important, I think, in CPG to step back and take a long-term view. And I could give you 25 examples of short-term trends that never panned out. What's really interesting about coffee and the reason that it is so powerful over the long term is what Tim said in his section. There's an emotional element to it. There's a premiumization element to it. There's a comfort element to it. And also, it is one of the few food and beverage products I have worked on in my 40-year career where it is deemed healthy.

Other than water, I haven't worked on one that the government wasn't trying to limit some version of consumption. And so this is a rare situation where it's energy and it has all the other attributes, and it has a health tailwind to it. And that's why there is no suggestion over the long term that it's going to change. And all of the diagnostics that we were doing, even post-COVID when it was slowing down, there's nothing negative we could find about coffee.

If you do some analysis, you'll always find something on the fringe. If you did in 1985, you would have saw the diet Coke coming in was replacing some of the occasions for a period of time. You see the same thing now to a degree on energy, but we have zero belief that, that is something that is a long-term structural change in the category.

Timothy Cofer
CEO & Director

You said it well.

Chethan Mallela

Rob?

Robert Moskow
TD Cowen, Research Division

Rob Moskow, TD Cowen. I wanted to know about the high single-digit EPS growth target for coffee. There's a lot of leverage there implied because the net sales target is only low single digit. And what gives you confidence that there's enough leverage to bridge those 2?

And if I could also come back to your 40 years of experience, the volume growth, I know it's in the USDA chart, shows volume growth over the last 5 years in coffee. Volume has grown over the past 5 years, but KDP's volume is down and JDE's volume is down, too. So who's taking all that coffee? Like who -- where is all that volume going, if not to the European leader and the single-serve leader here?

Timothy Cofer
CEO & Director

You want to take the first one on HSD?

Jane Gelfand
Vice President of Investor Relations & Strategic Initiatives

Sure. Look, I mean, what we're laying out for you are very identifiable actionable cost synergies that we're going after in short order and then longer-term opportunities, both in terms of top line and kind of continuous productivity and the Reignite the Amazing target through 2032 is a part of that.

All of which is to say, when we think about HSD, certainly in the first years out of the gate, that's very visible from a cost synergy standpoint, right? But -- and also deleveraging can help bridge that. As you go forward, you're going to have that much more traction on the various opportunities that Tim unpacked for you and you'll also drive a more resilient business such that you can get more ongoing operating leverage. But we'll have to prove it to you, right? Again, out of the gate, you have a lot of visibility between below-the-line leverage and the cost synergies, and you heard Roger talk about his confidence there.

Olivier Lemire
President of U.S. Coffee

Yes. Maybe from a total at-home consumption, obviously, last four years, we saw a spike in consumption in at-home through COVID and then decline in in-home as people return to normal life and work. This has been stabilized over the last few years. And we're coming from a very strong foundation with 47 million households and very good intel that we've got tens of millions of high-value households that have yet to convert into the Keurig system.

So with strong marketing campaigns coming up hitting in Q4 with good promise to consumer, great coffee without the grind and a series of innovation, and we saw new coffee system, we're very confident that we'll be able to return to growth from a volume standpoint.

Chethan Mallela

Let's go Lauren, and then to Steve Powers.

Lauren Lieberman
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. So I think I sensed a change potentially on time line to separation is sort of like at or before by year-end '26 or we'll be ready to go. So at the risk of word-sniffing, like confirm if that's right or not. But notwithstanding the comments on like lessons learned and we should go more slowly, I'm just curious why, like what the determining factors would be to decide to move more slowly or to do it right away? What you'd be looking to achieve or benefit from going more slowly?

And then secondly, I feel like we're spending a lot of time talking about coffee, why coffee, coffee, coffee. What changes, if anything, for Bev Co. going forward? And I'd love to hear about that.

Timothy Cofer
CEO & Director

Great. I'll take the first one. And Eric, why don't you take a shot at the second?

Lauren, I would say I'm not sure you heard a definitive change in time line. What we said on August 25 was we anticipated that this could close by the mid of next year and separate by the end of next year. You heard something similar today, but there was a shift around we still expect mid of next year for the close and that we will be ready to separate year-end. So those times are the same. The difference is in that nuance. And I think what you heard from us today is it will be milestone-based. We are not going to commit to a hard date to you today. And recall what those milestones are, right? We want to be sure that our business is continuing to perform well. Guess what, you saw it again today, it is, and we're committed to that.

We want to be sure that we have the right capital structures in place. And you heard us make big steps today towards that in terms of improved leverage at close and stated targets at separation. You also heard us say we need to be sure we've got world-class independent Boards of Directors and proven, experienced, high-caliber leadership teams. And you heard even an update on one of those points today around leadership of Global Coffee Co., which we're beginning a process to find that right leader. And then you also heard, let's make sure from a market condition standpoint that we've got the right conditions that could support a potential option, not yet a firm decision. We'll stay flexible and agile, and Jane covered that in her section.

So I think the broad time line, Lauren and group here is similar to what we said on 8/25, but with an important nuance where we'll be milestone-based and we'll do it at the right time when we're ready to get the right outcome for our shareholders.

Do you want to talk about Bev Co. and what an independent Bev Co. looks like?

Eric Gorli
President of U.S. Refreshment Beverages

I was able to talk to you guys for about 25 minutes on kind of our playbook, playbook that has been driving success. We really feel like that playbook is going to work in the future as well, and I gave a number of examples.

I think the separation, Tim hit on it, the focus on the Bev Co. entity from the management team, from our supporting functions, from the Board, I think that's probably going to be the biggest benefit. There is definitely a different culture for a fast-moving soft drink-centric, DSD-centric organization versus a warehouse model. I think the amplification of that and just how we go about creating the company's culture, coupled with the management team's focus will probably be the biggest underpinnings. That said, we've got a playbook that's working, and I would expect you're going to see more of the same.

Timothy Cofer
CEO & Director

No doubt. And the only build on Eric's point, for sure, around focus and culture. I think there are upside benefits to a stand-alone pure-play ref bev business. The other that I briefly mentioned in my remarks was around strategic optionality. And certainly, today, I'm not going to give you the list of here are the 5 things. But I would say, as you continue to advance a scaled strong brand portfolio, many different categories of participation, strengthen that DSD muscle, there could be options down the road that present themselves around ownership in different levers of the business, brands, distribution, et cetera.

So we'll take a step at a time. But I do think an option like that longer term is enhanced. It's more accessible, more available, more actionable, should we choose that that's in the best interest of the shareholder as a stand-alone ref bev company.

Chethan Mallela

Steve?

Stephen Robert Powers
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I was actually going to ask along a similar line, which is shocking. We have a habit of doing that. So, it's Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. So I get the -- that future focus and optionality post-transaction. But as you assess this initiative today going out and kind of doubling down on coffee and separating coffee, that's a big project that wasn't envision. So just the opportunity -- how do you get comfortable with the risk and opportunity costs of pursuing that and maintaining all the good that you've been doing on refreshment beverages? How do you handicap that? And how big of a consideration was that? Really my main question.

I do have a secondary question, which probably is for Jane. Just on the separation, I think the base case is to spin coffee. But then earlier, when you talked about the different optionalities, you talked about partial IPO of beverages. Just what that means for the existing debt that KDP has? Does that stay with Beverage Co.? Does that go to Coffee Co.? Do we know?

Timothy Cofer
CEO & Director

I'll start with the first one, and Jane can take the second one.

Look, Steve, it is all about execution. This is not something that's unique in the world. We would agree that it's a big undertaking and has complexity to it. That's not daunting for us. As I shared on stage, many of us on this stage right now have experience in large acquisitions, integrations, separations, right? We've done it before. Many of these people on stage. And then it's really about do you have a great plan, set of processes. That's why we elected today to also ask Roger to unpack our transformation management office and our approach to that, obviously, external advisers, et cetera, carving off a group of individuals who are focused on that to then allow the vast majority of our 29,000 colleagues at KDP to deliver their mission day after day after day. And I think Q3, quite honestly, is an early proof point. This was a challenging quarter.

One might argue a quarter where there were some distractions, right? And look, we put up a pretty good quarter here that we're proud of. And so it is just about the right plan, the right governance around it, the right people with the right experience executing well.

Jane Gelfand
Vice President of Investor Relations & Strategic Initiatives

Steve, good question on separation plans. You're right that we've now named a couple of options to pursue a separation. The common element across those is it's a tax-free separation, and that piece is sacrosanct, and we're going to solve for that first and foremost. Secondarily, we got to think about, well, what's the optimal separation mechanism? And that depends on the circumstances in the market. And again, what we think will create the most value, right, for our shareholders. And so one potential is a tax-free spin. Another is this partial IPO concept, which would allow all of our shareholders to participate as we could consider floating a small portion of Bev Co. as well as bring in additional participants, right, and raise primary proceeds, which can be used to accelerate deleveraging.

We haven't made a decision. I think what you should expect us to do is to solve for optionality as long as possible and then think about, to your point, the debt structure, how we raise the debt, how we think about those moving pieces to maximize our flexibility. Not all of that has been decided yet, but that is something that we are very actively considering.

Chethan Mallela

Michael?

Michael Lavery
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Michael Lavery, Piper Sandler. Just wanted to come back to some of the milestones you laid out, one of which is operational performance. Would that include both businesses running on the algo targets?

And then second question, just on the pace of delevering. Originally, you had expected about a 5.6x at close and 5.2x at the end of the year, around half a year, obviously, around 0.4 turn. Now you're calling out about 0.5 turn on a full year. But did anything change? Or is that conservative? How do we think about the 0.5 turn?

Timothy Cofer
CEO & Director

Again, I'll take the first. Jane, you can take the second.

Look, our expectation is we continue to perform at a high level at both KDP and JDE Peet's. You've seen us do it so far this year, and that's the expectation going forward. And yes, we do believe, I said it on stage earlier, we're doing this transformational next step from a position of strength, and we think that's the best position to launch 2 new companies.

Jane Gelfand
Vice President of Investor Relations & Strategic Initiatives

As it relates to the leverage, right? So just to clarify because there are a bunch of numbers that we've thrown around, and I want to ground us in what we're talking about. The original plan, as was announced in late August, would have contemplated a net leverage at acquisition close, assuming June 2026 at 5.6x. We've made a set of announcements today that give us visibility to about 4.6x on the same time frame.

You're also right that we've talked about pace of deleveraging, right? And there is a little bit of delta between what we're seeing today, which we feel very, very good about, right, the 0.5 turn a year and some of the assumptions that were built into the 5.2x, which would have included some synergy capture in year 1.

And so look, I think what you're hearing from us is the commitment to maximize, right, cash flow and get to a very quick pace on deleveraging. I wouldn't read too much into exactly this number versus this number, the 0.5 turn and then the commitment to see if we can accelerate that responsibly is what you should anchor to from here.

Chethan Mallela

Kaumil?

Kaumil Gajrawala
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Kaumil Gajrawala from Jefferies. I guess a couple of things as you responded to the market reaction and you were thinking about all of your options. Why was the Apollo, KKR option, why were they the best partners? I believe they have a Board member coming on. Will that Board member be on both sides of future co, just one of the sides?

And then when we think about -- we only had 5 hours to think about this, but when we think about the new structure, you've talked about all the benefits, why it should work, everything that's -- how everything is intended to go. But what were the risks that you considered under this new structure on what if things don't go right, how much flexibility do we have to be able to get to where we're looking to go?

Timothy Cofer
CEO & Director

I think Pam will take the Board member question. Do you want to take the 2 new investors, KKR, Apollo?

Jane Gelfand
Vice President of Investor Relations & Strategic Initiatives

Yes. Look, we're extremely excited to partner with Apollo and KKR. Obviously, there is real strategic merit in the investments that they've underwritten, right? You see an expressed conviction in each of the future successor companies, right, and the value of the assets there and the upside opportunity, particularly as you think about Bev Co. and all of the optionality that we've talked about here, but also in terms of the single-serve prospects in North America and in the JV.

Beyond just the sort of economic profile of all of that, we get the benefit of some of the smartest minds in the financial world with a ton of experience in transactions, complicated transactions across industries, across the world. And we're excited to partner together and leverage that insight.

I will pass it on to Pam in terms of the Board member and all of those Board dynamics. But I'll just say all of the work that we've done over the last several weeks have absolutely been confirmatory of that partnership and the mindset with which we're walking into these strategic investments and partnerships, and we're excited.

Great. With regard to what was in the press release this morning about it would be our intent to name Brian Driscoll as put him forward in the proxy for election to our Board of Directors. I believe the press release said in conjunction with the transactions, which we were outlining in that press release.

However, we are initiating and have a very robust process using an outside search firm to help us because at the end of the day, whenever separation comes, we will have to stand up, as you've heard, 2 fully independent boards able to field the requisite committees, and it is our goal to make those best-in-class. While we may have some supposition and ideas in our head as to who might go where, we are way not at that point to begin to talk about that because we don't have enough people to field both. So it's going to be an iterative process, and we will use someone from the outside, and we have an internal committee that will be doing a lot of the leg work on behalf of the full Board, but of independent directors and of course, Tim and Bob participating as we go through the interview process and looking at candidates.

We always look for diversity of background, diversity of skills and filling in gaps in terms of capabilities as we look around the Board table. And we have to keep that in mind now for 2 Boards ultimately. So, hopefully, that answers your question.

Chethan Mallela

Great. I think that's about all the time we have today. So I just want to thank everybody joining us in person and on the webcast for your interest in KDP. I think you've heard very clearly about our conviction in the acquisition of JDE Peet's and the planned separation into 2 pure-play companies, and we hope you share our excitement about the future for KDP. Thank you.
