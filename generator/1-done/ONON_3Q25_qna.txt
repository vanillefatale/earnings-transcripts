[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez of Citi.

Paul Lejuez
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Curious if you could talk about the traction that you're seeing in apparel with any detail that you can give about regional acceptance of that product? And curious how it's performing in DTC versus wholesale accounts? And then just within your wholesale doors, can you talk about what percent carry apparel and any opportunity long term that you think? And when you think about the percent of accounts that carry footwear, what percent ultimately will cover include apparel?

Caspar Coppetti
Co-Founder & Executive Co-Chairman

Thank you, Paul, for the question. We're very excited about the apparel performance. As you've heard on the call just now. We sold over 1 million items now in Q3 for the first time and apparel and accessories together accounted for about 8% of our total business. That's a new record, and we're well on track of hopefully getting quickly into the double digits there. So traction is really strong. What drives this is we're really executing on all fronts.

So on the distribution side, our own stores play a very important role because we need to be able to showcase the breadth and the beauty of this product. So if you've been to any of our newly opened flagship stores, you'll see that come to live. But we're also doing that, for example, at department stores. Wherever we have shop-in-shops, we usually lead with apparel, and it's a great way to tell the brand story.

Now as we break down a bit into which parts of apparel are seeing the most traction, happy to give you a bit of color there. We have an exceptional strong running, training and tennis business in apparel. And within running, we clearly see that whenever we do something from the performance side, so we work with our athletes and we bring some of these latest material innovations to broader audiences that resonates very well.

In training, it's all about winning with her. And so the sweet spot there for on seems to be where we have light resistance work, so you at the gym or you're in a class and On brings performance innovation like [indiscernible] that we're rolling out now across the lines, but we're also bringing a bit more elevated aesthetic that resonates with our affluent customer.

And then, of course, tennis, maybe a category we even a bit underestimated just the tennis look, whether it's actually the performance here that our athletes wear in competition like João Fonseca, the Brazilians are crazy about it, all the way to the lifestyle looks, and you've probably seen what we've done with Burna Boy just now, bringing the tennis lifestyle to wider audiences. All these things resonate extremely well. Over time, we will definitely attack in additional categories there, bringing it more to movement and stuff that can be worn every day, always with the performance and innovation core. And we also have a very strong jacket business that is mostly reflected in our outdoor and running collections.

Martin Hoffmann
CEO & CFO

Maybe just add a point here because I think it's very important for where we are taking our business model. We said it on the call that really the way we look at apparel is as a company and the company, and it follows a slightly different distribution model approach. It will be much more D2C heavy, which doesn't mean we are not working with great wholesale partners, as Caspar just said. But retail will play a much stronger role in the physical presence of apparel. And as a result, our apparel business is expected to drive also a superior margin profile into the brand. So we are not only adding additional customers, but also additional profitability.

Your next question comes from the line of Jay Sole of UBS.

Jay Sole
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

My question just is the growth was obviously very strong in the quarter. At the same time, the gross margin expanded a lot. And at the same time, your inventory looks very lean. Can you just talk about how you balance driving top line growth versus protecting margins, your premium position, maintaining that scarcity model and just delivering an algorithm you think it's right for the brand for the long term, but also in a way that allows the company to grow without having any like operational issues?

Martin Hoffmann
CEO & CFO

I mean I think this is the result of the amazing work that the team is doing and that we really amplify capabilities in the organization across every part. And so we are really able to manage all the 3 areas that you mentioned in sync. I mean I think on the gross profit margin, it's just super important to understand that the premium business that we are building is the driver behind the gross profit margin. And of course, building a premium business also requires incredible discipline in your inventory management in order to protect the high share of full price sales. So this is the essence of what we are building.

And you have already seen the power of that business model coming to life in the last 2 years with our gross profit margin expanding constantly. And this has really been the result of the pricing power, the full price discipline, a more D2C focused channel mix, operational improvements and then also economies of scale. And now in the last months, this has really amplified given the power of our team, our strong team that we have in Vietnam working with the factories.

And so we have now really achieved a new level on gross profit margin that we also consider sustainable. And that's, I think, a great place to be given the environment around tariffs. So we are fully in control of our future. We will digest our -- the tariffs and still be well above our long-term target. And at the same time, we can reinvest into the business. We can invest into the brand, into technology. But we are fully in control on pricing, on doing the right things and also investing into the product. So this is the power of that premium position that we are building.

Your next question comes from the line of Alex Straton of Morgan Stanley.

Alexandra Straton
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Maybe just on the 2026 initial guidance at 23% rate. Was that a constant currency number? And then can you just elaborate a little bit more on how you kind of get confidence there by region and channel? I'm just curious if any geographies or channels or categories should decelerate more than others or what the kind of the composition of how you're arriving there is?

Martin Hoffmann
CEO & CFO

Thanks for the question, Alex. Yes, it's a constant currency number. So the 30% that we gave as a CAGR, both are constant currency. I mean I think it's important, and we had it in the script already to always be clear on what is our strategic aspiration. And this is to become the most premium global sportswear brand. And so the first focus of what we are building is to increase our addressable market. I mean about 75% of the people in our markets don't know about on. So increasing the brand awareness is a key first step.

But we are not using a shotgun approach to do this, but instead, we are extremely conscious about the different communities and customer groups we are targeting. So if you take Burna Boy and Zendaya, they speak to a Gen Z customer. If you take Hellen Obiri, she builds credibility with all kinds of runners. João Fonseca drives a hype in the brand in Brazil, and I could go on forever. But what is most important is that we are not fishing in the same pond as everyone else. Instead, On is really expanding the market of sportswear because in the end, our products give our fans an identity that is really rooted in the innovation and the design that we are bringing to the product.

And so we are bringing fans into our shoes and into the apparel that have basically not used sneakers or performance-inspired apparel before. And so ultimately, we are becoming a bigger part of the life of our consumers. And I think it's very important that this strategy is to set ourselves apart from everyone else in the industry. And it also clearly defines on what we are doing as a next step going into '26 when it comes to products, channels, and regions. So there's -- out of that strategy, it's very clear. If you look on the product side, you can expect a firework of innovation.

So we mentioned it on the call, early next year, we will update 2 of our key franchises, the Cloudrunner, the Cloudmonster. LightSpray will become big, and it will really revolutionize running. And then we still have a few surprises further down the road for next year. And then you already see the success of apparel and how this is really incremental to the business. Then in retail, we are continuing to add about 20 to 25 stores on an annual basis as we have done this year. At the same time, we are heavily investing into our wholesale partners. So really, if you will experience on in a physical space in a year from now, it will look very elevated to where it is today.

And all of this will drive strong growth in each of our region because that strategy will be working in each of our regions. And of course, we could not give such a strong outlook for next year if we would have doubts about the growth opportunity that we have in our largest regions, Americas. So this is fully embedded in there. And so I think this is the confidence and the strategy that is sitting behind the outlook and the strong increase that we have given on the 3-year plan.

Your next question comes from the line of John Kernan of TD Cowen.

Krista Kerr Zuber

This is Krista Zuber on for John. Just one on gross margin. You raised the fiscal '25 gross margin expectation. It kind of implies a modest expansion for 4Q against your toughest year ago compare. Can you walk us through the various sort of tailwinds, headwinds that support the outlook into 4Q? And separately, I think in the release, you mentioned favorable product costing benefits in 3Q and kind of what is the long-term outlook for that line item?

Martin Hoffmann
CEO & CFO

Yes. As I just said, I think it's super important to understand that a big part of the upside that we have seen in Q3 or the strong margin that we have seen in Q3 is really based on the power of the business model that we have built, and we consider this to be long term. If we look into Q4, I think there is still upside in the margin. We put some prudence in here. And then going into next year, that sustained uplift will still be there, and it will help us to more than offset the additional impacts that are expected from the tariffs to come into the P&L. And on top of that, we are benefiting from the current FX environment, from the current freight environment, which will drive additional margin into the gross profit. But really, the important piece is that we have taken a big step above our target that we communicated by improving the business that we have built.

Your next question comes from the line of Sam Poser of Williams Trading.

Samuel Poser
Williams Trading, LLC, Research Division

Real quick, you said at a conference that you said that the U.S. that you might tone down the U.S. growth. How much of what's going on right now of sort of with the really strong growth in APAC and EMEA. How should we think about the U.S.? And how much is that sort of more controlled growth, it sounds like you're going to do going forward reflected in the gross margin and the outlook for the gross margin?

Caspar Coppetti
Co-Founder & Executive Co-Chairman

Thank you, Sam. That's a very thoughtful question. Look, executing a premium strategy takes a lot of discipline. And the comment that we've made repeatedly also on these calls is that we're not chasing growth by adding especially wholesale doors that don't make any sense. We're also not chasing growth by discounting. And I can maybe give you a bit of color around the U.S. We're very happy to see that the price increases that we've done now in July of this year have been very well received, and we see continued demand growth, implying that our affluent consumers are not price sensitive.

So I think that's a very important fact as a lot of people seem to be concerned about the tariff impact. Secondly, our global brand tracker for the U.S. shows that it's one of the regions where we've gained the most awareness. And we're also gaining with relevance, especially with high-income teams and affluent demographics, combined with a high relevance in running. So all the things we do around running, like Hellen Obiri winning the New York City Marathon, these things translate into more demand from consumers.

And then thirdly, as you have heard on the call, Q3 saw less season sales. We always have a very small percentage anyway, but we saw even less than we had last year. And we're going into this holiday season with a full price strategy. So we have no discounts coming up, and that's against the backdrop of a very price competitive environment. So we're really staying true to the discipline that the premium strategy demands.

Samuel Poser
Williams Trading, LLC, Research Division

And when we think about your initial look at '26 and the raise of the 3-year plan, is that -- would that sort of mean on an FX-neutral basis, that sort of ongoing double-digit growth in the U.S., but significantly higher growth in Asia and EMEA.

Martin Hoffmann
CEO & CFO

I mean will -- it includes strong growth across all the different regions. As I just said, a lot of the things that we are building, they will amplify the opportunity that we have as a brand, the reach that we have as a brand in all the different regions. So our assumption is based on the continued strong growth of the U.S. And so it is on a continued strong growth of Europe and Asia Pacific. I mean just take apparel, for example, this is a global story. Apparel is as much underpenetrated in the U.S. as it is in Asia Pacific and the growth opportunity is massive in each and every region. We will expand on retail in all the different regions. And then at the same time, we will not change the philosophy that Caspar just mentioned on expanding wholesale. So we still have about 60% of the key account doors from Foot, DICK'S and JD where On is not yet present. And so that's a multiyear opportunity, but again, very much with a focus on building the brand in a very meaningful and controlled way.

Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Liu of JPMorgan.

M. Liu
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats on an excellent quarter. I have 2 questions. One is in APAC, very impressive triple-digit growth. You mentioned triple digit in Greater China, South Korea. I was wondering if you could share how much of that comes from space versus same-store sales growth or like-for-like growth. And then secondly, just a quick clarification question. I think you had your raised guidance implies a mid-20s growth in Q4. We know there's tough comps here, but I just wanted to track what are the considerations behind this outlook, which still looks pretty conservative. What are you seeing in each regional market since October?

Martin Hoffmann
CEO & CFO

Okay. I think in Asia Pacific, we talk about very different markets. Japan is a market where we entered in 2015. We have a strong presence with our wholesale partners. We are very carefully expanding with additional retail stores as we just have opened the one in Ginza, but this is a playbook of growing brand awareness and being where the customer is shopping. If we are looking in most of the other regions and I include China in that, I think On is very much at the beginning of the journey.

And here, we see massive same-store growth. And at the same time, we are extremely disciplined in opening additional stores. So the 20 to 25 store numbers that I gave earlier, that was a global number. So it includes China, which means we take the same approach as in every other region to very carefully go from one city to the other to build the brand in the right way and to really make sure that there's also a strong performance credibility.

And I think that approach just hits an environment where the demand for a premium sportswear brand is incredibly high, and we could easily sell more product there, but we see this as a multiyear journey. If we -- I think if we look into Q4, and we already gave some colors in the prepared remarks. It's always very important to understand what does the holiday season mean for on. For us, the holiday season is a moment to connect with our brands about the right gear for the season that we are in. It's to shop for gifts, but it's absolutely not the moment for us to drive sales through discounts.

And as Caspar said before, our commitment to full price sales is first and foremost, the commitment to build the brand long term. So when we look into Q4, we had a very strong start into October and into November. We spoke about China, single days for yesterday, 11/11, and we have seen incredible momentum in Tmall. Our traffic there has been up by more than 250%. And again, it's a full price environment. We achieved our apparel target much earlier than the end of 11/11. And if we are looking into Americas, we had a very strong holiday season last year, and we are now expecting that region to be in line or even slightly accelerated in terms of growth compared to what we had seen in Q3. So there's a lot of momentum on a global level.

Your next question comes from the line of Aubrey Tianello of BNP Paribas.

Aubrey Tianello
BNP Paribas, Research Division

I wanted to ask about profitability. Your EBITDA margin guidance for this year puts you a year ahead of schedule versus your 2026 target. How should we be thinking about the progression of EBITDA margin longer term now that you're surpassing some of these targets, especially, Martin, with your comment that there's structural improvement on the distribution expense line.

Martin Hoffmann
CEO & CFO

Yes. I think it's always important to recall the philosophy that we have when it comes to managing our business around profitability. So for us, it's first and foremost, about investing into the business, investing into long-term growth, which means investing into brand building, into building capabilities, the team, technology and at the same time, drive additional profitability year-by-year. And we keep on doing this unless there is a moment where our sales just exceeds expectations and we can't invest into the business in a meaningful way.

And this is a bit what we have seen now in Q3, where really sales came in much stronger than expected and has driven together with a strong gross profit margin, a high profitability. So our philosophy of approaching that profitable growth has not changed. And so we will approach next year very much with the same mindset. So how can we invest into the brand? How can we maybe accelerate some of the dreams that we are having that will continue to drive growth well beyond '26, given the fact that we have a stronger gross profit, we have a solid sales outlook, and we have an improved distribution line. And at the same time, how can we drive profitability beyond the outlook that we gave 3 years ago. So this is the mindset that we are approaching '26, and then we'll give a precise outlook in March.

Your next question comes from the line of Rick Patel of Raymond James.

Rakesh Patel
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

You touched on the opportunity with the younger consumer. Can you expand on that? Like what do you define as a young consumer? And how big is that business today? And then can you unpack your go-to-market strategy to acquire these consumers as we think about categories and geographies?

Caspar Coppetti
Co-Founder & Executive Co-Chairman

Yes. So we entered this space with running and the running categories is typically a bit older. At the same time, we entered the running category with an injury prevention technology, which made it even older, right? And so really over the last, I would say, about 6, 7 years, we have gained a lot of traction with younger consumers. The -- working with a generational talent like Zendaya has, of course, helped a lot. And you've seen recently, we started a collaboration with Burna Boy to add something more on the -- something that is appealing to male teens as well.

So if you're going across a high school in the U.S., especially in a more affluent neighborhood, you'll see the cool kid's wearing On's, right? That's a relatively new phenomenon. That's not something we're chasing. It's not that we depend on the market. But it's, of course, very inspiring that we're able to connect to this younger target group. And this target group gives us a very long -- a very strong LTV. You may have also seen that we have launched the kid's line. That is going phenomenally well. It's really hard to keep it in stock. Of course, for the small children, it's the moms and dads buying the product. So we're basically leveraging that appeal. But then we have also a kids line, so basically young teams, where we're also seeing very, very strong results.
