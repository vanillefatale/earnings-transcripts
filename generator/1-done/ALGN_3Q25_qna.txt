[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson at Evercore ISI.

Elizabeth Anderson
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Congrats on a nice quarter. It was really nice to see the acceleration in cases in the quarter. I was wondering if you would mind commenting on any early 4Q comments -- color that you've seen in terms of the end market. And also, just if you could comment a little bit further about the new ClinCheck launch and what you think the expected impact on the gross margins will be?

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Elizabeth, look, obviously, we felt good about third quarter overall. We are just looking forward to moving forward. The technology we're talking about incorporating overall, it is a comprehensive type of solution we've been developing over a series of years. I can see it -- two critical targets here is one to make it much more efficient for our doctors to be able to convert cases, understand the difficulty of cases and get the proper type of a structure for that case. And secondly, it helps us from an efficiency standpoint also in the sense of we can take our time with customers on other things that are maybe more difficult.

So it's great to see these things coming together. It's not just a productivity tool for those doctors also. It also helps them in their communications. We talked about the 15-minute, the live update piece. As you can be able to address that patient in that chair in 15 minutes, you have a much better chance of closing the case because you know what the extent of the case will be and how long it will be. So we're excited about that, Elizabeth.

Our next question comes from Jon Block at Stifel.

Jonathan Block
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Look, not many blemishes, but I'll try to find one. So ASP was supposed to be up a smidge Q-over-Q. It was down a bit. John, I think I heard you right, you mentioned country mix. So I think like for like was still maybe what you expected. But for 4Q, you do expect it to be up sequentially. Just help me out with that. So I'm guessing a full quarter of that probably helps with that. What else gets it up sequentially?

And then just more big picture, Joe, for you, if you want to comment on the pricing environment and really any thoughts on the timing about the potential rollout of what we're at least referring to as no refinement plan. And then I'll ask a follow-up.

John Morici
CFO & Executive VP of Global Finance

Yes, Jon, I'll take the first one on the ASP. It was really just the growth that we saw in some of the markets like China that has a lower ASP compared to Europe. So the opposite of that happened in Q4. Europe becomes bigger as a percentage of our total. They come out of their holiday season and that shows up in Q4 and China as a percentage comes down in Q4. So you really -- those 2 geographies drive a fair amount of ASP impact.

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

And Jon, your bigger picture on the no refinement plan. You can see we've been evolving on that route for a while, Jon. I mean, obviously, we went from a 5 x 5 to a 3 x 3. Our moderate products and those kinds of things normally didn't have any more than one aligner associated with it. So I look at this as not like a phase transformation. I look at this as a continued evolution in the sense of serving our doctors the way they want to be served.

And you think about it, too, Jon. I think what we've done is, we've developed the technology over the years in a sense that doctors understand these malocclusions. They don't need 5 additional aligners in most cases to be able to address things and they want that optionality to say, "I know this case. I think I can get it done without refinements," or "I can buy one if I do get in trouble," or "I'll buy an insurance policy because I'm not sure." So it's just -- it's an improvement in technology, but it's also an improvement in confidence in the sense that we have in developing our cases and the doctors do, too.

Jonathan Block
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. That was helpful. And I'll pivot for the second one. Maybe this falls to both of you guys again. You've certainly given some 2026 margin thoughts, 100 bps is good to see. Just any high-level discussion on the top line next year? It seems like, Joe, like half the Clear Aligner business is growing double digit. The other half is flat to down, being North America.

Systems and Services, at least in my view, is maybe a little bit longer in the tooth regarding the Lumina product cycle. John, you talked about ASPs being down low single digits. And when I roll that up, I land up LSD when you think about all those moving parts, but anything directionally for us to think about to sort of pair with the margin commentary?

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Jon, I'll take a shot at that, but that's a big question, right? So I mean, obviously, we gave you a fourth quarter, and we feel good about those projections that we have in the fourth quarter overall. Obviously, if you look at -- in my script, Jon, we talked about third quarter versus second quarter, we had 9 of our top 10 countries were up. And so we're seeing good robust growth.

Our biggest issue is actually North America retail. And, obviously, in North America DSO, we talk about it a lot. That growth is over 20% in some areas. And so we look to help us solidify that as we go into the fourth quarter. We think we'll continue with a strong global type of presence that we have. Right now, I'm not making any predictions for 2026.

Our next question comes from Michael Cherny at Leerink Partners.

Michael Cherny
Leerink Partners LLC, Research Division

Maybe, Joe, if I can just follow up on that last comment you made, at least in terms of the markets in North America. As you think about that retail customer, I'm trying to wrap in a lot of comments we already had, but what do you think is the biggest gating factor you think gets them back to some level of, I don't want to call it, normalized demand, new normal demand, whatever it might be? And what can Align proactively do relative to waiting out the macro in order to help them get there?

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Michael, it's a good question. I'd say, if you break down, again, North America retail side, Canada, we've had more pressure in Canada than I reported than we had in the United States. But overall, I think we continue to push hard on the DSO side because we know that, that works both on the GP side and on orthodontic side.

Secondly is, we feel like moving downstream from a marketing standpoint, getting close to our customers, advertising more around ZIP codes and all that can direct those patients to those doctors because I still lean into -- these are economic issues that I think that the retail customers feel more than what I call the business-oriented DSOs that we have out there. And as much as we can leverage our brand and the strength of our portfolio to help to drive that, I think it'll help to drive the marketplace, too.

I mean, ultimately, what addresses this, I think, is a much more confident U.S. consumer, but we can't wait for that. So we're going to use our brand. We're going to use our technology. You'll see us use our field force to get closer to our retail customers and doctors and try to help them out as much as we possibly can.

Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson at Baird.

Jeffrey Johnson
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Joe, just -- I promised you when I met you or when I saw you last time in Vegas that I was going to try to maybe get you to give us a little more detail by geography than you do on these high-level comments. So on EMEA and APAC, I think I heard you say up double digits year-over-year in both markets on Clear Aligner volumes. Just one, want to confirm that was the case on a year-over-year basis.

And two, are we talking kind of 10%, 11% there? Just trying to kind of use those numbers to back into how much if North America would have been down a few points or down more than kind of that low single digits, more in the mid-single-digit range from a North American case volume standpoint.

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Jeff, overall, to confirm that double-digit year-over-year growth that we talked about. Again, it was widespread. We talked about our top 10 countries. India being one that's growing well, Turkey in different areas, really strong performance in EMEA overall. So Jeff, I'm not ready to give any kind of broad specific numbers on the double-digit piece, but it's robust in a lot of different parts of the world, which gives us a lot of confidence in the sense that we can keep that kind of momentum, but also to make sure from a resource standpoint and a focus standpoint, we start to move our retail doctors in the United States more towards positive growth.

Jeffrey Johnson
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. All right. And then just on the U.S. side, I mean, obviously, that's where the biggest headwind remains. You talked last quarter about kind of the gross receipts looking good, but then the case is not closing. Any change in behavior? Did any of that clear itself up a little bit? Did it get a little worse?

And I think more importantly, on that front, just as 3Q itself played out in that retail channel, just again any kind of incremental improvements or degradations throughout the period. We did see consumer confidence come off in September and then again in October. So would just love to hear kind of what the exit rate might have looked like on 3Q as we head into 4Q here as well from a U.S. standpoint.

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Jeff, I'd say we did dig down into gross receipts and CCAs last quarter to try to explain what had occurred. I can tell you there's no primary change or any kind of material change in that data at all. It differs all over the world. We watch each one of those countries. There's really nothing to report on in that sense.

I think what you just mentioned at the end of your question is, obviously, you're watching the North American marketplace pretty closely and what you see consumer confidence and different things. But -- and again, nothing has really changed in the sense of how -- from an overall sales standpoint, how our DSOs continue to grow and how our retail accounts continue to be challenged. I guess, I'd overemphasized. It didn't get any worse. It's consistent.

Our next question comes from Brandon Vazquez at William Blair.

Brandon Vazquez
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Can I first start on the orthodontic side or more specifically, the teens? That seemed to be a nice highlight of the quarter. Last quarter, we were talking about this kind of shift back towards wires and brackets in kind of difficult macro times. I didn't hear any of that this quarter encouragingly. So maybe just spend a minute on teens, what was driving kind of the growth there? And do you think we're moving past this kind of shift back to wires and brackets again and we're a little bit back on the offensive there?

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think, overall, when you look at that teen increase, I mean it was pretty phenomenal when you look at the growth. Remember, it's a big China growth period for us from a teen standpoint. That's their season. And we saw really substantial growth there, which is tremendous. What's helping to drive the growth also are our new products like IPE and mandibular advancement with occlusal blocks. It just gives us more leverage to be able to start those patients earlier.

And often, as we mentioned before, Brandon, Invisalign First goes along those products one way or another to be able to address different types of expansions or different kinds of malocclusion. So what I like about the teens is it had good breadth to it all over the world. We saw the same thing in Europe also and in some of the emerging economies that we're doing. Again, I think it's the penetration that we're getting in those areas, but also our technology, the breadth of our technology, particularly for early interventions in kids.

Brandon Vazquez
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Okay. And maybe as a follow-up here, switching gears a little bit. The -- one of the common themes that I've been hearing among many in the dental space, including yourselves, is that DSOs seem to have some kind of algorithm working correctly here, driving growth in some different segments within dental.

I don't know if you guys will give this number, but just out of curiosity, if you will, what percent of your business is DSOs at this point, roughly speaking? Can maybe spend a minute or two on why they specifically are doing better and if that should be durable as we head into next year?

John Morici
CFO & Executive VP of Global Finance

Yes. Overall, Brandon, it's about in the 25% or so. It varies by country, as you know, but that's probably a good ballpark to be in.

Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette at Mizuho Securities.

Steven Valiquette
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

So, I guess, from my side, I was just curious to hear more color around the evolution of the HFD patient financing partnership. Just curious if that help in any notable way to help get patients across the finish line in the third quarter, or is that still maybe going to be just a bigger factor for the fourth quarter and into 2026, where that stands right now.

John Morici
CFO & Executive VP of Global Finance

Steve, this is John. Yes, I would say it's helping, and we're seeing more and more doctors use it. You see it across some of the DSOs. They've taken advantage of that as well. But when patients are -- potential patients are deciding whether they want to go into treatment and it usually comes down to some type of pricing, what's the overall price? And then in all cases, it gets down to how much is it per month if I don't pay it outright. So HFD becomes more critical with that. We like the partnership that we're seeing and more and more doctors are using it. So I would say it's playing out how we wanted it to in the third quarter, and I would expect that we'd see more of that in Q4 and beyond.

Our next question comes from Jason Bednar at Piper Sandler.

Jason Bednar
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

I wanted to start on the China market. It sounds like a pretty good third quarter you had there. Just wondering, any updated perspective on the competitive landscape and anticipated VBP in that market as well as how or whether you plan to adjust your go-to-market and pricing strategy in light of VBP.

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Jason, I mean, we're aware of what's going on from the VBP standpoint. It's still not clear exactly what provinces at all will be included in that and exactly when it will be implemented. But we're positioning ourselves because we know, ultimately, that's probably going to happen one way or another. But I don't have any new news to report versus what we had in the second quarter.

Jason Bednar
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. And Joe, when you say you're positioning yourself, maybe what exactly do you mean by that? And then I'll just ask my follow-up now. I wanted to drill down on the topic du jour here that U.S. retail commentary you're giving. The DSOs doing well. They're up strong double digits. Sure, they're more sophisticated. But it's also evidence this isn't necessarily just a consumer spending problem in the U.S.

So, I guess, I'm wondering out loud if it's not an economic or consumer spending problem and maybe the business that you're -- that's more sensitive here is some maybe lower volume, maybe lower ROI business for you in accounts that have more economic incentive to switch or convert to a cheaper alternative. I guess, how much effort do you put behind defending that business, especially at a time when you're really committed to delivering on margin expansion targets next year?

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I guess, the first part of your second question was about China again. Remember, there are a lot of Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities. So we did have to make sure that our portfolio is structured properly to be able to get at those types of patients because primarily, we've been structured around private patients in the larger areas of China.

Overall, when you say defending things, I think -- I'd like to think that we expand markets with our new technology and what we do. And I mean, obviously, we have to defend certain territories in certain areas. But I look at this market as a market that we can expand. And obviously, we've had a difficult second quarter and whatever. And -- but as we continue to develop technology, remember, 75% of the people out there still have a malocclusion and there's a lot that we can address by this overall.

So part of this is not just playing defense, it's playing offense to help to grow that marketplace. And so that's not just in the United States or different parts of North America. That's all over the world. And you can see that strength in the business as we reported in the third quarter.

John Morici
CFO & Executive VP of Global Finance

And I would say just to close on your DSO comment, I think that some DSOs are doing a really good job. They're recognizing what's happening in the marketplace. And they're seeing that maybe consumers that they're out, maybe they're coming in for a cleaning. What do those DSOs do? They're scanning most patients. They're giving them a lot of visualization kind of before and after. Many of them are competitive from a price standpoint -- an overall price standpoint, and almost all of them are doing external -- internal and external financing like an HFD.

So they're really working. It's not to say everybody is on the same page and some retail doctors are doing this as well, but DSOs kind of en masse are taking that digital orthodontic approach and then being very patient-sensitive in terms of how do they get that patient into treatment. And that's just a great example of the market opportunities that's there, but doing it in a way that really tries to get those potential patients excited about treatment.

Our next question comes from Vik Chopra at Wells Fargo.

Vikramjeet Chopra
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Congrats on a nice quarter. I just want to confirm that you're still confident in your 5% to 15% growth targets that you laid out in your LRP. And if so, is mid-single-digit top line growth on the table for next year?

Joseph Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Vik, we're sticking with our 5% to 15% plan for the future. That hasn't changed, and we really believe the business can do it.

Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin at Bank of America.

Michael Ryskin
BofA Securities, Research Division

I'll just ask one. You called out some of the geographic mix shift in terms of how that impacted ASP as you went through the year between Americas and China and EMEA. You also had an FX tailwind that I think -- I mean actually started as a headwind in 1Q, kind of was essentially neutral in 2Q, and it became more of a tailwind in 3Q. And then I look at the sort of like list of reported ASPs, it's been relatively consistent in the $1,240, $1,250 range.

So if you adjust for some of that FX becoming more and more favorable as we go through the year, there is -- it does look like the underlying ASPs are a little bit weaker. Is that purely just attributed to the geo mix and maybe product mix? Or is there anything else going on there you can point to?

John Morici
CFO & Executive VP of Global Finance

Yes, Michael, this is John. So when you look at like for like on, say, Europe or like for like within the U.S., ASPs are up on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We just have as such -- we're very pleased with the volumes that we saw in some of these emerging markets, like China and so on for us. It's just that the ASP is lower. And that's the effect that we saw.

So despite the FX and everything else, it's that country mix that drives that ASP lower. Had we not -- if you took China out, our ASPs would have been up significantly or pretty well from Q2 to Q3. It's just that you've got that country mix piece of it that comes in. And then you see the converse of that in Q4, where you have less China in Q4, more Europe, as an example, there's just a difference in ASP and you will see an ASP improvement as we go from 3Q to 4Q.
