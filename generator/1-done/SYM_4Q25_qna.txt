Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions] Our first question today will be coming from the line of Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank.

Nicole DeBlase
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Maybe just starting with Medline. Is it possible for you to provide a bit more color on the relationship what they've committed to? And then it seems like health care could be a pretty big opportunity with respect to new customers. Anything on how aggressively the sales force is pursuing that right now?

Richard Cohen
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

So you broke up a little bit, but the Medline relationship is something that we worked on for about a year, maybe a little bit longer. And it was a combination of understanding what they wanted to accomplish with the hospitals and the critical care units that they deliver with and then for them to understand how the ability of our system to handle lots and lots of items and also the incredible accuracy with which we ship product. And then thirdly, the ability we have to sequence products because oftentimes to hospitals, you're delivering to a specific section, to a specific floor. And so we work with them to give them a good understanding of the unique capabilities of our system. And so that's why we won the award, and we're -- they have lots of warehouses, great customer. So I'm very excited about that.

In terms of future growth, we've added about 5 or 6 new salespeople in the past 6 months. And so we're much more in the aggressive marketing role than we were before. Probably a year ago, we were still wanting to make sure everything was working and testing out. And as I tell the organization, you can't scale chaos. But over the last year, as we began to hit all our time lines for builds and price points for execution and the quality of the way we measure it and some of our internal measures has more than improved by almost 300%, so we're feeling very bullish about being able to handle a much broader base of customers and to deploy systems that will work on day 1.

Nicole DeBlase
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

That's really helpful. And you kind of alluded to this, Izzy, when you were talking about like the cadence of 2026. But is the expectation that you guys start to really ramp next-gen systems still kind of around the middle of the year? I think that's what we shared on the last earnings call. And does that mean we're going to have kind of stable revenue through the first half and then the next step-up kind of comes in the second half of '26?

Izilda Martins
Chief Financial Officer

Nicole, that's exactly the way we're thinking of it. As you know, we unveiled it last quarter. So we had some signings then and this quarter's signings are all about the next-gen system. So what that does is exactly what you said. You'll call it see a less pronounced increase in revenue in, call it, the fourth, the first and the second, and then you'll see more of an increase towards the tail end. So Nicole, I would say you got that right.

And our next question is coming from the line of Joe Giordano of TD Cowen.

Joseph Giordano
TD Cowen, Research Division

On Medline, can you talk about like what's contemplated there? Like how many sites are we talking about? Like what types of technology is this encompassing? Is there a break pack in this? Is there room for the micro fulfillment strategy in there as well? Like what was like effectively added to the backlog from them right now?

Richard Cohen
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Yes. So Joe, it's one site. It's a proof-of-concept is the way we look at it. Obviously, if we do a good job, they have a lot of warehouses. And initially, we contemplated a pretty straightforward moving case system. But we also -- as we think we can upsell or extend to sell to these customers, micro fulfillment, which could either be in a receiving room in a hospital for them or very specific selection for them in a warehouse. And then BreakPack is also an opportunity for us to sell. So basically, we could sell them 3 different products. But right now, we have -- we're starting out with the first original product.

Joseph Giordano
TD Cowen, Research Division

And then do we need to like -- I just want to make sure I understand the comments about Walmart where like the 2 phases being incorporated into 1 now. Do we need to like change the way we describe these things? I guess like I just want to make sure we understand the definition. So if you say like 10 new systems were started, can some of those new systems effectively be like 2 that you would have said last time? We have to talk in dollar terms instead of number of sites now?

Richard Cohen
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

I'll turn that over to Izzy because I'll get in trouble.

Izilda Martins
Chief Financial Officer

I think the way you said it, you have it right in the sense of not every system is created equal. But going forward, the size of the system is going to be slightly larger. So that's how I would think about it.

Richard Cohen
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

They could be slightly larger or we also have the ability to do some smaller systems in terms of smaller space in a warehouse, so it gives us a lot of flexibility. But what Izzy was saying is absolutely right is that in the same amount of space that we were going to install in operation in some of our bigger sites, they can actually take down more of the warehouse because we can do more work in the same space as we did before.

Operator

And our next question is coming from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup.

Andrew Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

So systems gross margin was, I think, a high watermark, close to 22%, and that's despite all the changes you're making to your systems. And I think you had spoken about more flattish gross margin for Q4. So is Q4 a function of ASR mix maybe being a little higher? Is it safe to say you're on a better glide path given improved operating leverage, better execution? Any more color on where -- whether you think your system gross margin continues to sort of just kind of go up from here?

Izilda Martins
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So let me tackle what you said in the beginning of your question, is how I think about, call it, ASR in the quarter, it's really, call it, mid- to high digits in terms of a percentage of total revenue in the fourth quarter. And I kind of would expect that to be about the same as we progress. I think the bigger part of your question is how you think about, okay, how do you unpack the margins? And I would say we feel really, really bullish about our system margins, not only where they are, but where we're headed.

So I think that if you see the last several quarters, we have kind of a little bit of a lumpiness, but I think it's about the exit trend where we landed in the fourth. And I would say, even though we don't guide to margins, I would expect that to be a slight uptick in the first. But I think it's more about when you think about how we're recognizing revenue in, call it, that 12- to 18-month period, given when we roll out the next-generation storage system that we expect those margins to really to be expanding in the coming quarters. That's really what's the key part. And like I said, I would reiterate, if there's one thing I would walk away from today is the fact that we are very bullish about where our margins, not only where they are, but where they're going.

Andrew Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

That's helpful, Izzy. And then, Rick, backlog, as you know, has been somewhat flattish for Symbotic. I know your burn rates are going up. But do you think you could grow Symbotic's backlog in FY '26 and/or we know you're ramping on GreenBox, ASR. Can you give us an update on whether FY '26 is a big year for Symbotic new customers, GreenBox? Can you start booking backlog for ASR? Like any thoughts around all that?

Izilda Martins
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So you're trying to track me a little bit. So we don't guide to backlog, but here's how I would say, right? Given the guide we gave for the first quarter, I would expect our backlog in the first quarter to really be no different to where we are. You do have in the 10-K, call it, what our banding is, but what's coming through in the next 12 months. So I would say too soon to tell of where backlog will be. It's not something that we talk to in the coming quarters. But I think you have to take 2 takeaways. As Rick said, we've built up our sales team. We obviously have more opportunities, and so we will continue to do that.

I think it's also important to think about that backlog for us is strictly what you do from a GAAP perspective, not what we think could happen given that most customers will do one system at a time. And then last but not least, what I'll leave you with, maybe not in the next 12 months, but soon thereafter to some extent, is to think about that we still have more than $5 billion of backlog to unlock with the mini micro fulfillment systems. So I'm not troubled about backlog at all. I think that's more about our long-term strategy. But I would say that 2026 is a solid backlog.

Operator

Our next question will be coming from the line of Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs.

Mark Delaney
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

First one was on GreenBox. And now that you have a CEO of GreenBox and also given the new store structure that you've had and some of the progress you spoke to around building out sites there, I was hoping you could speak a bit more on the progress at GreenBox in terms of finding new customers to use the GreenBox sites.

Richard Cohen
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Yes. So our first site that will come live will be Atlanta. I mean some of these sites are still under construction. Some will be a year away, some maybe be a little longer. But Atlanta will come alive. We have a lot of interest in Atlanta, no customers to announce yet. But we expect, hopefully, by the -- in the next 90 days, next 180 days, we'll have some announcements as to who our first customers will be. We continue to get interest. And now that we actually have facilities, we are in discussions with customers about how much space they want and when, but nothing to announce yet.

Mark Delaney
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Anything in particular, Rick, you think new customers would want to see in order to get across the line?

Richard Cohen
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

No. I mean I think what's happened is -- what we're seeing is on the real estate space, there was a downturn after COVID and then some of the big guys have gobbled up a bunch of space. So there's a shortage of space right now. So we're very well positioned. And so we're talking to people about some would be different versions of GreenBox, some might be just jet storage. Some might be very proactive warehouse handling services. And then we're starting to talk to a few new customers about just being a whole active 3PL. So we're in a pretty good spot because we're ahead of the market. And so we're talking to different customers about different things right now.

Mark Delaney
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. And just one more for me, if I could, please, on GreenBox. Your partner, SoftBank, has said they're looking to raise capital more generally in order to fund some of the investments they'd like to do. So as you think about what that may or may not mean for GreenBox, any implications you can share in terms of how GreenBox is looking to have the funding and what that might mean for the pace of deployments at GreenBox.

Richard Cohen
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Yes. So I mean, our agreement with SoftBank is Iron Cloud. They're there to provide the funding. So we don't have any worries about providing the funding there. And we have a lot of cash to do our part of it as well. So funding will not be a problem with GreenBox.

Operator

And our next question is coming from the line of Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer.

Colin Rusch
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

As you get into these customer conversations in a bit more detail, can you talk a little bit about the potential for adjustments to bot design or even system design more broadly and how we might think about the cadence of that evolution?

Richard Cohen
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Yes. So that's a great question. What's happening is that the customers are coming in now, and I'll answer your question in 2 ways. So what's happening is that the market is appreciating the fact that we're not selling the same system that we were 10 years ago. And a lot of our competitors have not innovated. They're just scaling. So our bots, for instance, we introduced to one of our customers, what we call a stretch bot. So we can now handle a 36-inch case. We might even be able to handle 2 18-inch cases. So the bots have more flexibility. We've introduced vision and LiDAR on some of our bots. So we have collision avoidance. So customers are coming in, and they've -- and even some of the ones that we talked to 5 years ago who weren't ready to make a decision, they come in now and they say, "My goodness, the pace of change with which you guys are doing things."

So I think we're really differentiating us from the rest of the world. One of the things that we have done a lot of is we've moved to cloud-based, we're investing in AI resources, the databases. So we can do sorting and slicing and pallet building and for instance, truck routing, I think maybe better than anybody in the world at this point. So I should avoid superlatives, but our customers say, nobody can do what you guys are doing. So it's not just building very aisle-friendly pallets, it's building super friendly aisle pallets, but we can actually route the whole truck because of the reliability of our bots, which has made huge progress in the last 2 years in terms of we pick very, very, very high percentage of what we say we're going to pick, and we never make a mistake picking. So for hospital supply, that's absolutely critical.

But for other people, like we're tarting to go live with our Southern Glazer's site pretty soon and it's liquor and so it's both bars and restaurants. And so the ability to route trucks is really critical for them, and they're telling us other people can't do it. So we continue to make improvements, both in software. Our bots are getting much more technologically both intelligent, but also better vision tools, collision avoidance, better routing. And we're also innovating on our pallet building and depalletizing to get product into the system. So it's been -- I mean, the reason I do what I do is I love the innovation, and I love the fact that we have a team that can do innovation very quickly. And that's creating a big noticeable distinction between us and the rest of the market right now.

Colin Rusch
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

That's incredibly helpful on our side. And then just from the human capital and the competition for talent, we're hearing about a variety of different dynamics on that. Can you talk a little bit about your ability to attract folks and retain them as this market really heats up in terms of both physical AI as well as some of the software that you're talking about?

Richard Cohen
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Yes. So the reason we went public is because we had to create a compensation system that would allow us to attract people that were used to being compensated in stock. And so we're not doing $1 billion packages out in Palo Alto, but we're doing pretty good in the Boston market and in the East. We also have opened an office on the West Coast. We've also opened an office in Vietnam because OhmniLabs, which was one of the health care -- small health care start-ups that we bought has a lot of Vietnamese people that founded that company.

And so we've opened an office in Vietnam where there's huge talent. So we're getting more than our fair share of talent and at a faster rate. And one of the things that's been interesting is as the EV space falls down some, we are getting people from the EV world that are just disillusioned with some of the things that are happening there. And basically, our bot, the way we're approaching it is an electronic vehicle with LiDAR and collision avoidance. It's not passenger carrying, but we do some very complicated things. And so we're able to attract people because they like the problems that we're solving. And our comp is as good as anybody needs to be. We're not going to compete with ChatGPT, but there's plenty of people that aren't going to work for them either.

And our next question will be coming from the line of Guy Hardwick of Barclays Capital.

Guy Drummond Hardwick
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

It looks like the -- based on the change in the RPO that there was very strong bookings in the quarter, the $600 million, $700 million, could you just split that out between the Medline new win and pricing?

Izilda Martins
Chief Financial Officer

Just to make it clear, Medline was something we signed in the tail end of the quarter. So Medline is not going to influence really our results in the fourth quarter. Really, Medline is about no different than how we've spoken to how we recognize our revenue over almost really a 2-year period. So I wouldn't put a lot of, call it, credence to numbers or how we achieved our fourth quarter numbers with the announcement of a new vertical. I think the fourth quarter is about the momentum that we've created for over months on end on the installations and moving, call it, 6 more sites to operational. That's really what drove it, plus the fact that, yes, we did sign 10 more agreements. But overall, the -- I would characterize the, call it, the success of the fourth quarter based on the momentum that we've been working on for months on end.

Guy Drummond Hardwick
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

So Medline was not in the RPO, the $22.5 billion RPO at the end of the quarter.

Izilda Martins
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, it is in the RPO, but it's not -- has no significance to the revenue generated in the quarter.

Guy Drummond Hardwick
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. So I'm just -- my question was more, was it material to that increase in the RPO? Because given you would -- it implies that your bookings are at $700 million given the revenue burn in the quarter plus the change in the backlog. So that's a very significant increase compared to, say, previous quarters. So question is really the mix of that, how much of it was Medline versus the increase in pricing?

Izilda Martins
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I would say it's more about the increase in pricing or call it how you consider what we did years ago and how inflation has moved. So that's really the main driver in the RPO change. But yes, Medline is in there.

Guy Drummond Hardwick
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And just in the 10-K, which you referenced, Izzy, it looks like the 12% of the backlog will be delivered over the next 12 months. That's quite a big increase. And if you go back 12 months ago in the 2024 10-K, you said 10%. It looks like you actually missed that 10%. You came in more at 9%, particularly if you include the ASR R&D revenue. So given what you said also about being a back-end loaded year, 12% of that backlog seems quite a big significant step-up on the previous delivery, which you effectively kind of missed slightly. So what reasons should we give us confidence that you can deliver 12% of the backlog in the next 12 months?

Izilda Martins
Chief Financial Officer

I think it's all about what we said in our prepared remarks, given that we're seeing, call it, improvements from that start of installation to the end line. And that's what gives us the, call it, the momentum that we're talking about. Yes, we do have ASR that we built in during the year. So you're absolutely correct. But I think you really -- we need -- we're laser-focused on the exit trends and what the new structure delivers. As you know, it's -- not only is it more dense, but more importantly, from an installation perspective is that it has, call it, somewhat the subassemblies that come in that have that process get done at a much faster pace. So a quick call out on the 10% to 12%, but I'm really comfortable with the 12% that we have in this year's ending.

Operator

And our next question is coming from the line of Derek Soderberg of Cantor Fitzgerald.

Derek Soderberg
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

On the recurring software fees, I'm wondering if you can share what new customers are signing up for in terms of an annual software fee on a percentage basis. Can you share that at all?

Izilda Martins
Chief Financial Officer

Unfortunately, that's not an area that we give any more color. I think it's just in general, how you map, call it, what we move to operational and when we start triggering that software fee. But I would think if you take the -- a little bit of the exit trend, that's really what we would be expecting in the near term.

Derek Soderberg
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then, Rick, you mentioned there's about 76 million square feet of distribution centers in the health care vertical. I'm wondering if you've done the math internally, how many modules does this equate to? Or what's sort of the dollar opportunity? Just wondering if you could help us size that health care vertical in the U.S.

Richard Cohen
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

I haven't done that, but you can ask Izzy after this call is over.

Operator

And our next question will be coming from the line of Jim Ricchiuti of Needham & Company.

James Ricchiuti
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

I think late in the quarter, there was an announcement regarding Symbotic working with, I guess, a small battery technology company, I think, in the U.K., Nyobolt. And I'm trying to understand the significance of this. And if you could talk to how we might think of potential deployments? Is this going to be on new projects? Is there a plan to move forward with retrofits as the maintenance schedules dictate?

Richard Cohen
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Yes. So all our new batteries starting, I think, from February on, we'll have Nyobolt batteries. So we, for the last 15 years have used ultracapacitors. And an ultracapacitor can take 1 million charges, but the charge only lasts about 8 minutes. The Nyobolt is actually a battery, but it charges the same way as an ultracap, and it can take a 40-minute charge. Now that may not seem that much to you at home, but the American grid, especially with all the stuff that's happening with AI is pretty erratic, especially in hot weather places like Florida and Texas, which also had tornado. So the ability to go 40 minutes is like a lifetime for us in terms of reliability of the bots.

So when there's a power flicker, we want our bots to get back to a home station, which is on a charge plate. And in the past, sometimes 8 minutes wasn't enough. So this is just one more thing that as we show new customers what we're doing with battery technology, most people are operating their bots with a third rail. It's kind of an electronic wires in the system. And so you have -- when you have a flicker, the whole thing is down. But -- so the progress we've made on battery technology, and we've taken a stake in this company, it's very, very exciting, and we can actually use these batteries for other parts of our system and sometimes actually to help our customers keep uninterruptible power supplies in their warehouses.

So it's just one more thing of the [indiscernible] technology that we had a problem, the American grid is pretty bad or erratic. And so we're thinking, well, how do we solve this problem for these automation systems. So I think this is really going to help us in life sciences and a bunch of other areas. But just in general, our systems are way more reliable than they were even 2 years ago.

James Ricchiuti
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Follow-up question. Just as we think about your fiscal '26 goals, I'm wondering how does geographic expansion figure into that? Obviously, you've got a site in Mexico that you're working on. And I'm just wondering if there's an opportunity you think in fiscal '26 to perhaps get into Europe.

Richard Cohen
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Yes. As a matter of fact, half our sales team is in Europe today. So we -- it's been interesting with Europe because so many of the great automation companies came from Europe because Europe had either smaller land spaces, more restrictive labor laws. But as we go to Europe, especially with our smaller, denser warehouses, people are really getting interested. And we've been doing this long enough that the reliability issues are not a problem. So I'm very optimistic about Europe. We see lots of opportunities.

Operator

And our next question will be coming from the line of Ken Newman of KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Kenneth Newman
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Izzy, I wanted to go back to your comment about the change in the phasing of the revenue. I know you said you expect less pronounced sequential revenue growth in the first half versus the back half. Just looking historically, though, I think in the last 3 years, sales have typically been down sequentially, high single to low double digits, 4Q to 1Q and the midpoint of the guide is assuming something that's a little bit better than flat. So I just want to make sure we're understanding that growth comment for accelerating growth in the back half versus what already seems like a bit of a stronger start versus typical seasonality?

Izilda Martins
Chief Financial Officer

That's fair. If you take the high end of the range we just gave for the first quarter, we would sort of break the trends that we've been typically seeing at least from what I saw in the last 2 years. So clearly, that's our main focus. But if you take, call it, the bottom end of the range I gave you, and that's really just about 1% less than where we landed in the fourth quarter. So it depends. But if you take the midpoint, we're kind of flat to exactly what we achieved in the fourth quarter. But internally, as you could imagine, we're trying to get past this lumpiness and really be continuing on continual improvement. And so although I guided right in between, guided slightly under where we are in the fourth, so the guide was $610 million to $630 million. But if you take that midpoint, that's really where I go about this less pronounced sequential improvement. But the overall goal, to be clear, is not to have that lumpiness in the first quarter going forward.

Kenneth Newman
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. No, that's very helpful color. I appreciate that. And then -- and secondly, for my follow-up, we are hearing some more comments from hardware-related manufacturers around higher DRAM pricing and memory shortages. Rick, can you maybe just remind us how memory intensive are the SymBot deployments? And just any comments on what you're seeing broadly from chip availability and pricing as it relates to your ability to kind of keep margins stable even though I'm sure you're able to pass through the pricing. Is there a risk of just nominally margins kind of stepping down?

Richard Cohen
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

No, not for us. I mean our bots are -- I mean, basically, what our bots are doing is transmitting data back to us, which we then process in the cloud and with different various algorithms, which are mostly proprietary. So yes, we're buying more cloud storage, but not significantly like the super big guys are. And so -- and it's coming down in price. But we're not doing that directly on the bots. What we're doing is we will take the information that the bots transmit back. That's a controllable expense, though it's going up and then reprogram the bots for different various edge case behaviors. So like a bot will see something and say, I don't know what to do.

And so it will transmit back to us. But the bots are being trained, but the bots are not truly independent AI machines. We kind of take that information back, do the processing, run the algorithms and then send it back out in a software release. So chips are not really a problem for us as we get bigger and better. I mean, I think this time next year, we'll have over 20,000 bots. So we're a major factor for some of the medium and smaller-sized companies. And even NVIDIA, there's a certain amount of -- the lower-priced chips are what we're using. We may upgrade some of those chips, but they're not the $25,000 chips that other people are buying, and we don't use that many of them.

Operator

And our next question will be coming from the line of Mike Latimore of Northland Capital Markets.

Mike Latimore
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

I guess I'll just build off that last answer. I guess if you're expecting 20,000 or so bots in a year, can you give us kind of a baseline of where we are now?

Richard Cohen
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Yes. I mean we have about 15,000 bots right now. So we expect to keep growing, and there'll be different kind of bots that we'll use. Those will be different versions. The back of store mini system will use a similar bot. So there will be different versions of our bots as well.

Mike Latimore
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

Got it. That makes sense. And then I guess just on the new system starts in the quarter, I think you said there was 10. Were there any break packs in there? And I think last quarter, you had guided to sort of mid-single to upper single digits. And should we still think about that as kind of the run rate for a while?

Izilda Martins
Chief Financial Officer

So there's a mix of the -- in the 10 deployments we had in the fourth quarter. Yes, there were a couple of BreakPacks. Sorry. And your next question was -- can you repeat your latter part of your question?

Mike Latimore
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

Sure, sure, sorry. Yes, last quarter, I think you had guided to system starts being in the kind of mid- to high single-digit range, and then you did 10 this quarter. So I guess any new view on the system start number?

Izilda Martins
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Something we don't typically guide to is what our, call it, system starts are going to be or which ones are going to be moving into operational. I think the best way to think of it is although I said historically, I want to get away from the lumpiness in the revenue. I do think though, sometimes we do have more of a tail end of those deployments in the fourth quarter. Now we have a healthy amount that we have throughout all the quarters of next year, but I think it's less about trying to manage what they are and more about, okay, the size and how much is going to be coming through in the revenue. So more importantly is the guide of the $610 million to $630 million in the top.

Operator

Our next question will be coming from the line of Greg Palm of Craig-Hallum.

Greg Palm
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

I want to go back to systems gross margin because that was certainly a highlight, and it sounds like you're pretty confident that, that can continue to improve. So any way to -- maybe, Izzy, if you can sort of break out or bucket out some of the positive impacts in the quarter and just sort of broadly what's happening from an improvement standpoint relative to maybe the last 12 or 18 months?

Izilda Martins
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I mean I think that we keep going back to the same thing, but I think we've actually seen it over multiple quarters. And really, the way I would think about it is we saw a little bit of, call it, a decline in our operations services, but yet overall, we had a terrific gross margin on the bottom line. So if you just -- if you go through all the math in our earnings release, and I know it's not the easiest thing to track to, you'll come back to that the systems is really where the powerful improvement is.

I think if you unpack the quarters, really what it comes down to last year at this time, we did have some cost creep. And I think what -- if you walk the halls here in Wilmington, what everybody reminds me of is that we did have that really disciplined cost management for the entire year. And with no cost creep in how the supply chain team installed the systems, that's really what's driving the overall systems gross margin. And not to mention what it will become as we deploy the more denser systems. So even before that, I think that's really what's the highlight, not only in the quarter and the highlight of what we feel bullish about what the systems margins will be going forward.

Greg Palm

Okay. Yes, makes sense. And I guess, Rick, I'm fairly certain that Medline was a pretty large user of another competitor in the warehouse automation space. So I'm curious, like does this have potential to be a competitive displacement, something that could be expanded from this initial site? Like I know they've already automated a big chunk of their footprint already. So just want to hear what the actual opportunity with them could be over the years.

Richard Cohen
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

The answer is yes. We -- our technology does things that other people's technology doesn't do. We also can augment some of the other technologies that we've seen in some of their facilities, but we would do bigger projects. And I think we -- if they like what we're doing, and I don't want to mislead anybody, we don't have a contract for any more than one. But if they like what we're doing, I think we have a huge opportunity with them.

And our next question will be coming from the line of Keith Housum of Northcoast Research.

Rick, I know it's kind of new news here. The largest retailer in the U.S. is scaling back some of their investments with, I guess, a smaller competitor of yours. I guess any thoughts on what was perhaps driving that? And any -- is that dampening the enthusiasm that you see from your customers about the use of this type of technology for the fulfillment centers going forward?

Richard Cohen
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Yes. No, actually, it's actually supercharged interest in our technology. So what's happening in the e-commerce space and in the supermarket space, in particular, is the congestion from all the people picking orders in the store, the DoorDash and that stuff, Instacart was a great convenience, but it's really very confusing and messing up the stores. And so what we're talking to people about is how can you put 20,000 or 30,000 items in 10,000 square feet and deliver in a marketplace or a city that could be actually used the fresh produce from the store. So it's -- the e-commerce s evolving in the way of -- the biggest guy in e-commerce delivers 1.2 packages or 1.2 items per delivery. But the retailers in the food space are delivering probably 15 or 20 package order.

And so it actually allows them to do a lot of things that you can't do when you're just delivering 1 or 1.2 eaches. The reason I can't speak fully -- I mean, I have my own view, but I'll express it here, why that retailer made a change of mind with that technology. But I think what you're starting to see and where is that -- we can actually use the same bot but pick each -- and pick eaches or use -- bring a tote -- a bot can bring an item or a number of items to a pick station, very similar to what we do in our BreakPack installs and actually do customer orders, which is -- initially, we -- this is what we've been trying to explain to people.

Three years ago, we did a BreakPack where a bot would bring a tote to a person, the person would pick it and then we basically batch pick it. The same more or less concept can be deployed in the back of a store, except you're picking a customer order. And so that -- the real problem that people are trying to solve with e-commerce now is speed of delivery and much more local. So I think our commitment and our largest customer asked us to develop this for them, we're really excited. This is a very, very big market.
