[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.

Lauren Lieberman
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

So 2 kind of clear themes in the remarks that I wanted to ask about. So Andre, first, kind of what gives you confidence in the near-term acceleration that you mentioned a couple times? And to what degree is that about kind of comparisons and base period dynamics versus like real fundamental improvement in acceleration? And then, Shailesh, I know we'll get a lot more from you at CAGNY, but what gets you excited about this longer-term "reinvention" of P&G? It was a notable choice of words in the press release and then also in the prepared remarks.

Andre Schulten
Chief Financial Officer

Lauren, thanks for the questions. So let me start with half 2 acceleration. I think the first positive element of quarter 2 results is the strength of the business outside of the U.S. If you look at Latin America 8% growth, Europe in aggregate growing 3%, China growing 3% on top of 5% growth last quarter. Asia, Middle East, Africa is up 2%. And if you exclude the restructuring exits, it would be up 4%. So there's real underlying acceleration in the business outside of the U.S. and that is grounded in interventions that we've made in terms of innovation, in terms of commercial strategies and in terms of doubling down on the precision and quality of execution in those markets with Latin America really being ahead of the game here.

And that's proof for us that the core strategies we're implementing, I think, are showing the results that we want to see. The U.S. underlying results, we believe, will improve because we don't have the base period headwinds that we saw in quarter 2. As you point out, I think that's part of the acceleration we expect in half 2 versus quarter 2, not having inventory headwinds to the degree that we saw in quarter 2. But the main element here, I think, is the fundamental execution of the same interventions we made outside of the U.S. earlier.

If you recall, the U.S. slowdown was really a little bit delayed versus the balance of the markets. So we started in the rest of the world earlier with the innovation, commercial interventions and execution. But that same playbook is being executed in the U.S. Early indications where we have done this, for example, the Tide boosted launch that is now in full distribution as of December. We're seeing results that are giving us confidence.

The innovation we're launching on Olay just now on the jars with a new campaign and the launch of treatments at the same time with a new architecture gives us confidence. The innovation we have on Baby Care, first wave executed now, second wave coming later, Tide evo coming in the back half of the year. So there's a wealth of innovation we're launching. We've clearly identified with our North America leadership, the opportunity in sharper execution across all retail channels, and the team is committed and is turning that into execution changes.

And then the simple opportunity to leverage the strength of our brands by staying fully invested across the second half in media with even better execution. So all of those elements that we executed outside the U.S. that are showing progress we feel will work in the U.S. And if we don't see any one-timers anymore in terms of base period headwinds, that will translate into stronger growth. And our objective clearly is to leave the year with share growth in the U.S. Shailesh, you take the second part?

Shailesh Jejurikar
CEO, President & Director

Yes, I will. Thanks, Lauren. So first, what excites me is plenty of growth opportunities. We see that everywhere, but it's not going to happen on its own. It will require us to create our own tailwinds, be it playing in a growth segment and driving it like Personal Care or playing in a segment which wasn't growing like pest with Zevo and then having that category grow high singles. So we see growth, or you take China Baby Care, another example where you take and put the odds of growth with the lowest birth rates and all of that, and we find a way to grow there. So that's one thing that excites me.

The second one is a unique once-in-a-generation opportunity to leverage the shifts in the landscape and our unique strengths and capabilities to set ourselves apart. The media landscape is changing, the retailer landscape is changing. There is tremendous amount of technology, both from a point of what is applicable using AI, enabling a lot of other things, but even fundamentally our own product and packaging technologies, and then consumer preference and demographics which are evolving.

Then you take those and take our strengths and capabilities, brands with large consumer base. If you have a large user base and you're really delivering amazing products, you probably have the biggest fan club already right off the bat. Consumer understanding and consumer data, we have so much data that we have put in. We can get an answer even before getting started. And that flow just continues, and we are further strengthening that. Take the media spend leverage and take the different places we could be using it. That is another huge opportunity.

Our R&D spending and capability across multiple areas of technology from formulate chemistry, substrates, devices, biology, that just enables us to innovate much more broadly. You take the China Baby Care, it's one thing to get the insight, another thing to find a way to put silk in the product, another thing to be able to communicate it to consumer, bring it into packaging, bring it to life with user-generated content. So it's the ability to bring all of that together. And the technology platforms and applications we have been building, and Andre talked a bit about this. We are -- I would say we have been building a lot, and I would say the future is here, it's just a little uneven. So our job is to integrate and bring it all together.

Your next question will come from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.

Stephen Robert Powers
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I'm going to ask a question that kind of follows the same structure as Lauren's question. So the first one, on the second half improvements, if we think about things by category, segment versus by geography, I guess, maybe a little bit more detail on where you expect progress and sequential acceleration to manifest most clearly. It sounds like laundry and Baby and perhaps Skin Care from what you said, Andre, but maybe just if you could elaborate a bit more from that perspective. And then, Shailesh, if you think about all those different pieces of operational enhancement and reinvention initiatives, how do you think about the path and time line from here for the company to put all of them together and create those own tailwinds and win in the marketplace across the portfolio with consistency? How long does that take in your mind?

Andre Schulten
Chief Financial Officer

Steve, if I look across the businesses, the innovation interventions, the commercial interventions, the execution focus is consistently applied across every part of the portfolio. I will tell you the base period effects are probably a strong help when you look at Family Care, Baby Care and even Fem Care, they were most heavily impacted in the first half of the year. So Family Care, for example, we see strong growth in January, even turning into share growth now, and we expect similar dynamics to happen across Baby and Fem.

Baby, at a global level, is actually growing share, so has returned to share growth in the most recent reading. So the momentum is there. We continue to work on the mid-tier proposition. You recall, we had innovated on the top tier. That continues to work well. Swaddlers, Cruisers 360, we've made the innovation interventions on Luvs a year ago. That's working. On Baby Dry, we have a two-phased approach. Phase 1 is executed. Phase 2 is coming later. So that's still work to be done.

On laundry and fabric enhancers, we have very strong innovation Tide Boost that I mentioned before, the biggest laundry liquid upgrade in 20 years for consumers and that is taking hold and working. And we're preparing for the Tide evo launch. We have strong innovation across fabric enhancers as well. And as you know, that's still a huge opportunity in terms of household penetration. So communication effectiveness and copy quality is improving.

In Beauty -- in aggregate, Beauty is growing 4% and we have an opportunity to strengthen growth in Skin Care in the U.S., making strong progress on SK-II outside of the U.S., on Olay outside of the U.S. And I think the new launch of Olay that is just coming out with strong retailer support, I think, will accelerate that business. Personal Care has momentum and will continue momentum in the U.S. and globally. So I can continue to go down the list, but I think I've given you enough depth to say this is really across the portfolio. It's the same idea, double down on the consumer, double down on the execution, double down on the quality of the brand campaign.

And I think that's where Shailesh is putting his focus, if I can speak for him. He's really doubling down in every review on the quality of the execution, the quality of the brand campaign, the quality of the architecture thinking and it's stimulating thought. It's stimulating quality of execution. And I think that gives us confidence from a geographic standpoint, as we talked earlier to Lauren's question, but also from a category standpoint.

Shailesh Jejurikar
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Andre. And I'll just bridge, Steve, from what Andre said to what I'm going to say. But some of it will be sequential just simply because in U.S. also when we make the interventions, we are extremely deliberate about making sure those interventions also drive category growth. So that's also why some of this has to happen with big innovations.

But switching to your question, so I think a lot of the way to think about the future is we have, in many cases, already built platforms. Take the core data lake that I talked about earlier. I mean that did not happen overnight, cannot happen overnight, requires data capabilities, requires partnerships, but also importantly requires internal cultural change for people to work the data and systems in a certain way is not a change that you can just do overnight. Even if you have the technology solution, very often the culture change needs to go along with it.

And so a lot of that work has happened or is happening. The time line, if you asked, as you specifically did ask, is I think by the time we really get the future evenly distributed, I think we're talking 12 to 18 months. But it is not one which is a line of demarcation. So you will see parts of the business and certain businesses better equipped to take on all aspects of the transformation. So some businesses may be ahead of others, some regions may get ahead of others. But the simple answer to your question is really, I think, to get the future evenly distributed will be 12 to 18 months.

The next question will come from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo.

Christopher Carey
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to ask about investment levels. P&G has recently announced a restructuring program and you're going through some initiatives today, new media platforms, supply chain integration with an evolving retail landscape. Obviously, there's an expectation for improvement in sales growth, rebalancing of this, I guess, top line and move toward algorithm over time. Can you give us a sense of the sort of cost of this progress, I suppose, and kind of the balance between the restructuring and some of the savings that, that's going to allow for you relative to what you feel like is going to be needed, potentially, especially if you don't see that acceleration that you're going to be looking for in the coming months, if you really want to stimulate the top line for this business over the next 12 to 18 months?

Andre Schulten
Chief Financial Officer

Chris, let me take a crack at this. The first part of the answer is many of the investments have been made over the last decade. If you think about the amount of money it takes to build a consistent global ERP platform, the data lake, the data governance structure, data engineering, all of that has been done. So that was part of the results that we delivered over the past, I would say, 5 to 10 years. The investment to activate the technology, specifically around the innovation capabilities, the media capabilities won't be significant. It's an investment in scaling, but the underlying technology, the underlying data, that heavy investment is already done. So in that sense, I don't expect major capital or expense investments.

On the supply chain side, you see us build capacity and as we build capacity, that capacity is built in a way that it leverages automation, digitization, both on the manufacturing side and on the warehouse side. So the elevated investment level in terms of capital is really related to building capacity, building capacity in a different way, but not fundamentally more expensive. So I don't expect, again, on the capital side, a significant shift. The restructuring we have announced in June, the 2-year program, I think will take us through the majority of the org changes and portfolio changes that we need to make.

From there on out, if this works the way we want to, it will basically allow us to grow without incremental investments in organization or people. So if you think about it, the objective is to grow productivity, sales per head, disproportionately once these capabilities are implemented, but we don't think it requires another wave of significant restructuring beyond what we typically have as part of our core earnings. So I wouldn't look at a cliff of investment that comes with this. The second part of your question on return to algorithm, I would say let us get through the next 2 quarters and focus on acceleration, and then we'll talk about where we see the next year and how close to algorithm we come once we have that reality under our belt.

The next question will come from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.

Dara Mohsenian
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So Shailesh, I just want to dial down a bit more into the U.S. market. There's always an opportunity under a new CEO to refocus the organization and tweak areas of emphasis. Obviously, there's broad changes in the retailer environment, as you mentioned, AI technology, consumer landscape, et cetera, et cetera. And also, we're coming off a very difficult category growth environment in the U.S. in calendar '25. So just as you look going forward, what are the most important priorities for the organization in terms of driving better execution, reaccelerating that organic sales growth and specifically P&G's part of driving category growth. And part of the question is I'd like to better understand what's changing in terms of areas of emphasis of the strategy plans versus more where you're doubling down on execution in existing plans.

Shailesh Jejurikar
CEO, President & Director

Sure. Thanks, Dara. A few areas. So I think the -- as I said, I think if we get the elements of our plan right, I think there is opportunity to grow the market. So I think that is doable. What are some of the changes? As Andre talked about, the interventions short to midterm that we are looking at and which also bleed into the long term. So it isn't just one separate short- and long-term intervention. One is the media landscape has changed very dramatically over the last few years. I think probably driven somewhat by COVID habits, a bunch of other things, the way people consume media and content has changed dramatically. Adjusting our brand building plans to fully reflect that change and leverage it is the first big intervention we are focused on as we review plans, including in the U.S.

The second one linked to the retail landscape, there are a couple. But the first one is linked to when you see which channels are growing, where the growth is coming, we need to adjust the kind of innovation we do. The way we are calling it is stronger core, bigger, more because by definition what we are finding is just given how challenging it is to get awareness, how important it is for the big items to be there. For instance, even on e-commerce where you can list everything, it's really the first screen or 2 that matters. And so having the item which has the velocity is extremely important.

And so the way to think about it is a stronger core, for example, is the Tide liquid relaunch. You have an amazing user base. You give them a delightful product. They continue using it, use more of it and attract other people to come use it as well. The bigger, more, a good example is launch of something like Tide evo, which is transformational. So you are going to get consumer attention and engagement. So we're changing the innovation to reflect that both from a point of view of how the media is being consumed, but also how the retail landscape is playing out.

The third area of change is, of course, very deliberate on consumer value, particularly in a market like U.S., a lot of it is about strengthening our proposition. Again, Tide is a great example of it, but we are going to have that pretty much across every category where we significantly improve the value by significantly improving the product performance so that the consumer notices it and feels the value. So one of the areas that we're looking at across categories is significant strengthening of the propositions. And in many of these cases that do not come with a change in price. So we will be significantly strengthening value.

So if I were to just summarize what I just said, it would be adjust to the new media landscape with how we do our brand campaigns, adjust how we innovate with much more emphasis on a strong core and a bigger, more and then ensure we are delivering really good consumer value.

The next question will come from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.

Robert Ottenstein
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And I think you've kind of hinted at this, but let's just talk about the U.S. and Amazon. Our data is showing that it's driving disproportionate amount of the growth in your categories, depending on the category, anywhere from 60% to 80% or so. How specifically is that impacting your media efficiency and competitive dynamics against smaller brands? What do you need to do differently? And perhaps, do you have any particular learnings from China that are relevant here?

Shailesh Jejurikar
CEO, President & Director

Andre, do you want...

Andre Schulten
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, I can start. Robert, couple of points that I think Shailesh hinted towards. I think having the core brand as strong as possible by improving the performance, improving the claims, the e-content, all of that, I think is the best and most urgent thing to do across the entire portfolio. So when it shows up on the landing page, it shows up as strong as possible. I think that's number one.

I think there's an opportunity, specifically if you look at online businesses, the willingness of consumers to actually go into higher-priced items is still very, very strongly developed. If you think about categories like Hair Care, if you think about categories like Skin Care, where small brands tend to play is in the upper end of the spectrum from a price per usage component. I think that's an opportunity for us to innovate which is stronger core and a bigger, more and the more, especially on online, I think, can be premium priced. So that's where you see innovation happening.

And in general, the last thing I'll leave you with is taking smaller brands and looking at some of the ideas that these creators are bringing, I think, is good inspiration. So we're looking at some of these brands and saying, that could be an interesting idea, maybe on some of our core business, or it could be an interesting idea to replicate as a line extension. There's nothing unique. If you think about the ability that the ecosystem of small brands can bring, not technology-wise, certainly not from a marketing scale perspective, certainly not from a supply chain perspective, but the creative stage is something interesting for us to look at.

Shailesh Jejurikar
CEO, President & Director

I'd just add a couple of points, Andre, on this to what you said, which is, firstly, at a broad strategic priority level, we are very, very deliberate about ensuring we win in the fast-growing segments which may be channels or segments of a market. What is exciting to the point you made, Robert, about the e-commerce growth at a variety of retailers and variety of countries is very often, if we can channel that right, it can dramatically grow the market size and category.

And if you want to take a stark example and move away from the U.S. for a second, we go to India where our portfolio is slightly different and has been evolving differently. E-commerce is growing probably at 10x the pace almost of offline, and our share is about 1.8x of our offline business. So we are very deliberate about that, whether it's the U.S. or India or any other market to make sure that happens.

The drivers, as Andre pointed out, of winning there need certain things which we are making sure we have across the board, which includes content, which includes the item specificity and making sure those are strong and growing and playing with the right portfolio. So those all become very critical elements whether it's Amazon in U.S. or any other e-comm player in the U.S. or outside the world.

The next question will come from the line of Peter Galbo with Bank of America.

Peter Galbo
BofA Securities, Research Division

I'm now happy to be contributing very much to the Baby Care comps in the Galbo household. So I wanted to ask just regarding, Andre, your comments around returning to kind of the lower half of algorithm in the back half on the near term, maybe a bit of clarification there. I think at one point in the prepared remarks you talked about your categories growing at maybe 2%. Then there was another comment about if we took out the lap, you would have actually seen organic sales at 3%. So just maybe you can help clarify a bit on what you were trying to say with that comment as I've gotten some inbound from folks on that.

Andre Schulten
Chief Financial Officer

Peter, glad to welcome you to the diapering household community. So if you look at our global categories, we see growth around 2% in terms of value. Enterprise Markets are growing at about mid-single digits. China is still negative by about 1 point. Europe, flat in volume, about 1% in value. And the most recent reading in the U.S., all outlet read, so our data would indicate about 2% -- 1% to 2% of value growth. If you look specifically at the OND quarter, there might be a point of -- there is a point of inventory within those numbers. So if you want to be optimistic, you could say the U.S. structurally could be growing at 2 to 3 points, but we have to see where that goes.

From our point of view is the actual results, we've delivered 3% growth outside of the U.S. so that's roughly in line with market growth outside of the U.S. And we have delivered minus 2% in the U.S., which is below the market. And a good part of that is the inventory effects, but there is a component of reduced share. So I don't want to gloss over the fact that we have work to do to recover share. Partially, that's already in progress. I talked about Family Care. We're making progress on laundry. But the recovery in the second half will include both the base period effect moving out of the market and us recovering share. So our objective is really to leave the fiscal year with share momentum out in the U.S. and at a global level.

The next question will come from Kevin Grundy of BNP Paribas.

Kevin Grundy
BNP Paribas, Research Division

Shailesh, I wanted to take a step back and ask for your assessment overall on the portfolio from a strategy perspective. So it's been over a decade since P&G completed its portfolio review. Success, as you know, didn't come right away, but ultimately did and set the company on a very strong path for growth. But now as we talked about on this call, the company finds itself in more of a transitional sort of phase of reinvention, if you will, as growth has slowed. So with that as context, I'd like your view here on whether you are generally pleased with the current portfolio. Is Procter still in the right segments within big total addressable markets, attractive returns on capital and stronger growth? Or do you see it possible that certain businesses may make less sense today in P&G's portfolio than they may have in years past? So your thoughts there would be appreciated.

Shailesh Jejurikar
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Kevin. I'd split it into a few parts. So first is, I think we are clear that we play in daily use categories where performance matters. So I think we feel very good about that choice. We feel very good about that choice because it's extremely well integrated with the total strategy. That's where superiority becomes critical. The whole model works well when we are in categories where -- daily use categories where performance matters. So I think that is one part of it.

Second part of it is what we call the Day 1 look. If we were starting our company today, we would look at our portfolio and say, "Okay, are we in the right places?" That has been really the genesis or driver of the restructuring that we talked about, about 6 months back, where we said we need to get out of certain parts of the business because simply them being a drag or where -- not where we saw future growth. So there's another part of it, which is just disciplined look, a continuous review of which are the right segments and are we playing adequately in higher growth segments or not.

There's a third element of it, which is when we look at categories, are we playing in the right segments? And something Andre just talked about, which is if you look at e-comm you see which category, what segments are growing and are we present enough in some of those. If you look at social commerce in some categories and see are we well represented in all segments, and we actually find a lot of opportunity at some of the higher price points in some of the categories in things like social commerce. So that's another aspect of the portfolio that we continue to strengthen.

And the final point I would make is we continue to look at where we can build greater strength. And we've always talked about the fact that health and beauty are 2 areas where we find we have still opportunity to build a stronger presence, and we continue to look at opportunities which come our way there.

The next question will come from the line of Peter Grom with UBS.

Peter Grom
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So I guess I just wanted to follow-up on the U.S. And I guess it sounds -- you sound confident in your ability to see performance improve. But I guess I was trying to just pin down what you're expecting in terms of category growth for the back half of the year. And I wasn't sure in your response to Peter's question around 1% to 2% growth, whether that's kind of the right runway we should expect moving forward or whether the guidance expects to get back to that 2% to 3%. So maybe if you could just elaborate on that, that would be helpful. And then I guess just related, at CAGNY last year, there's a lot of discussion around inventory destocking. So just any thoughts or comments on what investors should expect as we anniversary those impacts.

Andre Schulten
Chief Financial Officer

Peter, yes, thanks for the push on clarifying U.S. category growth. Our base expectation is 2% category growth in the back half. That's what we know and that's what we're planning on. From an inventory standpoint, hard to predict. The only thing I'll leave you with is I would not expect any significant inventory built in the second half. That's not part of our plan. We expect some level of inventory efficiency to be driven across retailers like they always do. Some of our retail partners are finishing up supply chain interventions, and that will probably lead to some efficiency in terms of inventory levels. So I would tell you a slight headwind from inventory is probably adequate to assume on a market base that has about 2% of value growth.

Operator

The next question will come from Filippo Falorni of Citi.

Filippo Falorni
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I wanted to shift maybe to margins. For the second half of the year, is it the right expectation to think that we should see an improving margin trajectory as well, considering the assumed improvement that you're embedded in the U.S. market, which is your highest margin business, and given the commodity outlook looks a little bit more favorable in your guidance? And then below the gross margin line, Shailesh, you mentioned a lot about the interventions that you're planning, including the U.S. business. Can you help us quantify where the sizing of those interventions? Where would they show up, whether it's with more advertising, more R&D, more promotional investment? Any help like sizing and quantifying those impacts will be helpful.

Andre Schulten
Chief Financial Officer

Filippo, let me start. At the risk of disappointing you, I will not give you margin guidance for the back half. I think the margin will be an outcome, and we will have to tactically maneuver to see where we want to invest for the strongest possible growth. We focus on top line, and we focus on EPS. And as you will have noticed, our guidance ranges on both are relatively wide, and they are wide because the outcomes will vary. There's still a lot of variability, and the most important variability to the margin line will be our conviction and need to invest. And so it's hard for me to give you a good indication of where that's going to land because it's going to be entirely driven by our ability and conviction to continue to invest in the brands.

Where that investment comes, I can start, Shailesh, and you jump in. I think it's mostly in the range of, again, the innovation we're launching and Shailesh talked about improving value by driving significant performance improvements on the core propositions. That will be an investment we are making. That's baked into our assumptions. And the second component is to communicate those investments effectively and consistently across the balance of the year. So the media side is an important part. I wouldn't expect a significant increase year-over-year, but consistent media spend across the second half. And the third one is trade-related spending to drive trial, create display visibility, secondary placement in store. Again, our path chosen is not heavy investment in promotion, depth and price. We don't believe that's market constructive, but it will be to drive trial of those superior propositions. So that's the third bucket. So product, media and communication and in-store visibility and trial.

Shailesh Jejurikar
CEO, President & Director

I think you covered it. Only thing I would say is the ratios of that vary based on the category. So the mix of which one needs a little more on product, which one needs a little more on advertising or visibility will vary. So that's the only point I would add to what you said, Andre.

Our next question today will come from Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs.

Bonnie Herzog
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I guess I had a question on your Grooming segment. Organic sales were flat in the quarter, which was a pretty big deceleration versus last quarter with volumes inflecting negative and then margins contracting nearly 300 bps. So could you provide a little more color, I guess, on what drove the weakness on volumes? And if there are any other factors behind the margin contraction outside of volume deleverage? And then maybe lastly, how should we think about the segment for the second half in terms of whether it's innovation and whether the business can accelerate?

Andre Schulten
Chief Financial Officer

Bonnie, I think you answered the first part of the question. I think the margin component and the bottom line component is an outcome of the top line. It's obviously a high-margin business. And so if the volume's slowing, that translates into the bottom line slowing, specifically since we don't curtail the investment in the business. Superiority investment across Grooming is very important. The timing of the Grooming business is heavily related to initiative timing. So year-over-year, the phasing of Braun initiative, female grooming and male grooming initiatives is a driver in the quarterly profile that you see. On the second half, like other businesses, we expect modest acceleration in Grooming related mostly to the U.S. And I think the biggest opportunity for our Grooming business is continued activation of the portfolio in the U.S. and quality of execution in U.S. stores, and that's what the team is entirely focused on.

Shailesh Jejurikar
CEO, President & Director

I'd just add maybe a couple of points, Bonnie, to that. One is we see within Grooming, a huge opportunity in continuing to drive Venus. That has upside in pretty much every region. In many regions, that's growing in the 10s and 20s percent growth. So we see a lot of upside on the female grooming side. We see a lot more on appliances as well. And then we are working on innovation which will have -- which comes in calendar '26, which should further drive category growth. And probably the last point I would make is in U.S., we are also looking at changing the way our shelves are in many of the retailers and significantly improving how Grooming comes across as a shopping experience.

Our next question will come from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala of Jefferies.

Kaumil Gajrawala
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

If we could talk a bit about usage and volume because there's so many puts and takes on your quarter, but to the extent that you're able to calculate what actual usage is in the households, has that sort of trended off as we got into the front half of this fiscal year? Is it about the same and the rest sort of within it is just noise?

Andre Schulten
Chief Financial Officer

I think, Kaumil, that is still a huge opportunity in our categories. Usage volume growth is slow to honestly flat if you look at the front half of the year and even in the last quarter both in the U.S. and in Europe. So reaccelerating household penetration, reaccelerating user growth is a big part of what we're focusing on. And if you think about it, a lot of the growth in the past few years have been price driven, right, as we came through the inflationary cycle of the supply chain crisis in all of our categories.

And so I think the opportunity for us now is exactly what Shailesh described. It is to improve the value proposition for consumers by diligently constructing propositions that have a perfectly matching performance profile, well communicated and executed without raising the price so we can make the proposition attractive to more households, more consumers more consistently. So the volume component will have to be a part of how we grow markets. As we talked about the second half, we believe this will take time. So we don't think this is an easy fix nor will it come quickly. So our growth trajectory that I just highlighted, the 2% value growth in the U.S., which is the assumption for half 2, largely assumes that the volume component remains slow.

Shailesh Jejurikar
CEO, President & Director

Just to add one point, reinforcing, Andre, what you said. But as we get on the journey of growth, I think user growth will be one which we place a lot of emphasis on. As Andre said, between user usage and price/mix, I think the last 5 years probably had, due to inflation, a bigger component of price/mix. We think the future is going to be a lot more about user growth as the foundation. And then that typically, when we get that, we also get the usage growth.

The next question will come from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.

Andrea Teixeira
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So I was hoping if you -- I have a clarification on one question. On the clarification you just mentioned, Shailesh and Andre, like you're assuming that your 2% category growth, but are you thinking you can stabilize or even perhaps have share gains with the interventions you're making? And within that, are you still seeing some trade down within your brands from, let's say, pods to liquid, or if that has stabilized? And my real question is on the productivity reinvestment, as you had a very strong productivity in the quarter, so are you thinking of like as you go in terms of reinvestments and all the media initiatives, innovation you've made and perhaps price-pack architecture for affordability, should we expect that to be canceled out? Or perhaps as you see this environment and the opportunity to lean into more of a value proposition, how are you thinking of like the balance between top line and bottom line?

Andre Schulten
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Andrea. From a share perspective, it certainly is our objective to leave the year with share growth both in the U.S. and in the rest of the world. But we also acknowledge that, that is an outcome of how well we execute, the competitive environment, other factors in terms of geopolitical dimensions, consumer health. So that's why we still maintain the range. And within the range, if we end up in the mid- to higher section, that will probably have an element of share growth. If we end up in the lower section, it won't. But be assured, our team's energy is exactly that. We need to grow share by growing more users, growing more households, and that's where all the innovation and the investment is focused.

On the balance between productivity flow through top line and bottom line, I'll go back to what I said earlier. It depends on what we see happening. We will certainly err on the side of more investment to drive more user growth, drive household penetration in the short term. If we are convinced that we have the right innovation, if we are convinced that we have the right marketing program, the right commercial program, we will double down, but we will be diligent in that assessment. So if we feel we've got the right program, we absolutely will continue to reinvest productivity.

The next question will come from Olivia Tong of Raymond James.

Olivia Tong Cheang
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

I want to talk a little bit about the margin. With productivity savings about 270 basis points this quarter, you reinvested 220 basis points of that, which I think highlights your pricing, productivity and reinvestment even as demand remains lower. So could you drill into that a little bit more in terms of what limitations there could be over the balance of the year on the price and productivity levers, particularly on price? Your implied second half guidance assumes some fairly strong margin leverage, but I want to understand those moving parts.

And then in terms of the guidance range, you mentioned to, in answer to another question that you can grow even without additional head count, leveraging sales per employee. What's the risk that you might need to adjust those investment levels as you think about delivering on EPS?

Andre Schulten
Chief Financial Officer

I'll give it a shot, Olivia, but you can certainly follow-up with the IR team to get you more detail. I think the margin productivity side, I feel very good about. We will continue to deliver in the range that we've delivered on. We have visibility to the productivity components for the next 2 to 3 years. So I think -- and we have the effect of the restructuring program kicking in. So I feel good about our ability to continue to drive productivity at the level we need to deliver investment and a reasonable EPS outcome.

Again, I won't get into guidance for next year, but it's certainly our objective to make progress towards algorithm over the next few quarters. The extent of that progress will not depend on our ability to deliver productivity. I feel very confident about that. But it will entirely deliver -- depend on our ability to stimulate top line growth in the market conditions we're facing and the level of confidence and conviction we have to invest behind that growth in the market. So I'll leave it there.

For the longer term, I'll tell you, I am fairly convinced, and Shailesh will jump in here, that with the restructuring program, the way we're approaching the organization design, the way we're integrating technology into the way we work and the way we want to decrease functional barriers, we think that's a powerful path forward to continue to drive organizational effectiveness and, honestly, free up a ton of capacity of our teams from internal work to focus on what really matters, which is the consumer innovation and execution.

Shailesh Jejurikar
CEO, President & Director

I agree with everything, Andre. I would just add a couple of points to frame what we are trying to do, which is productivity as fuel for growth, growth as a fuel for EPS. So we really think productivity enables us to do what we need to get the growth, which gives us balanced top and bottom line growth. So that is really the effort. So as you think of that, and that's really what Andre was also saying is, we're doing the productivity. We're very confident, by the way, in the productivity. But that finally is going -- success on that is getting us growing top and bottom line.

The next question will come from the line of Robert Moskow of TD Cowen.

Robert Moskow
TD Cowen, Research Division

Your -- Procter & Gamble probably does more than any CPG company to grow categories through innovation and improving performance. That's always been your mantra. But when you look at the data in terms of like the past 12 weeks or even the past year, the percent of products sold on promotion at Procter is substantially higher by about 200 basis points, 300 basis points. So I'm wondering, do you think this data like accurately represents what your approach is in market or -- because it would indicate that there is more need to move volume? And -- or is it inaccurately depicting what you're trying to do to improve the volume?

Andre Schulten
Chief Financial Officer

Robert, I'll give you a 2-part answer here. Good question. I think I've repeatedly said that I don't see a reason why the categories will not move back to pre-COVID levels of promotion, which are around 30%. That will happen. It's just a competitive dynamic, a retailer dynamic, a consumer dynamic, and it's happening sequentially over time. The promotion read you're getting is not wrong, but it only captures part of what the market reality is. It doesn't capture forward gift cards. It doesn't capture layered couponing, which is a significant part of competitive promotion that we're seeing. You're right, our promotion volume is increasing and probably will increase in the second half.

As we execute the innovation, part of creating trial for those innovations is to deliver promotion visibility. Not all of those promotions come with deep price discounting. In many cases, they don't, but they show up in the promotion line. So what I'll tell you is our objective is to grow categories. Have we done this consistently over the past 12 months? No. That's our -- when Shailesh talks about, we need to grow users and we need to grow usage, that is the part of category growth that we're striving to drive. And part of that has to be to generate trial because if you don't have new users try superior propositions, you don't get repeat and you don't get the growth.

Shailesh Jejurikar
CEO, President & Director

Thanks. I'd just add one thing to this, which is that as we strengthen our propositions, it should strengthen our promotion elasticities as well, so which means we will be less impacted as our propositions get stronger. So that is always something we look for. So there's a balance between ensuring we are building a future business, which is less dependent on promotions, but making sure we are not completely losing the plot on competitiveness.

The next question will come from the line of Edward Lewis of Rothschild & Co Redburn.

Edward Lewis
Rothschild & Co Redburn, Research Division

I just, Shailesh, wanted to touch on the regional mix of the business. Clearly, your elevated presence in the U.S. has served you well of late. But as the U.S. growth slows back to sort of, I guess, more normalized levels, and we see continued growth in emerging markets, for example, what you're seeing in Latin America, how do you think about the regional mix of the business? And the advantages that you see the business is having, are those regionally agnostic, or can they be applied globally?

Shailesh Jejurikar
CEO, President & Director

Great question. Let me take a crack at it. So I would say our task always, given our business size and other things is, first and foremost, to get U.S. growing faster. And I believe it is doable, and we have plans to try and do it. That is really part of what we talk about when we say we want to create the future. But similarly, we don't -- we think there are tremendous opportunities on the -- outside the U.S., which we are very focused on. And what we have tried to do is get very deliberate about which markets have that potential and then really double down in making sure we are playing to the future there.

So a lot of the portfolio choices we have made over the past 6 to 9 months have really been to put us in a position that we are playing in winning segments. Even if I take Latin America, we made the choice to change our business model in Argentina. A large part of that enabled us to much better focus on Mexico and Brazil. And we changed the organization structure in the rest of Latin America, which then enabled us to get much more consumer focused. And now we are seeing, as Andre mentioned earlier, 9% growth in Brazil. That's not the pace the market is growing at. Double digit in Mexico, that's definitely not the pace the market is growing at.

So I talked about India a bit earlier in a different context. But again, playing to the future growth there, which is heavily e-comm. I mean having spent a lot of my life there, it's staggering to see the pace of change over the last 5 years in that space. So we're very deliberate on the big markets outside the U.S. on how we're going to get the growth. Of course, China still remains a big one, has a slightly different profile of where it is coming from, but still a lot of future opportunities. So we do believe many of these large markets, we are well positioned to play to where the future is going.

Andre Schulten
Chief Financial Officer

And I would just say it's an end. We need to get the U.S. growing and we need to grow outside. And I think the good news is, maybe only one point to add, is the margin structure that John and then Shailesh have built in Enterprise Markets allows consistent investment because we have -- we can cover the cost of capacity, the cost of capital. So it's not dilutive. It funds itself. And that's the core idea behind expansion and growth in Enterprise Markets.

Your final question will come from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler.

Michael Lavery
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Just wanted to come back to some of the share opportunities and how to think about it relative to value for the consumer. You've talked about the importance of that, but also it sounds like no real price changes are under consideration. You've pointed out some of the premiumization some smaller brands are doing effectively and maybe delivering better benefits and value in that way. But you've also had, of course, some private label strength and share pressure. I guess how do we reconcile all of it? And maybe is it as simple as just a waiting game for the consumer health to improve, or is there more to do to move the needle on how the consumer sees value other than just sort of trading them up?

Shailesh Jejurikar
CEO, President & Director

Yes. No, great question. I would say it's not one thing because a very critical part of our strategy of delivering value is also having a portfolio. So Luvs plays an important role in Baby Care in that sense. Similarly, on laundry, we have a portfolio with Gain and Tide Simply. So across markets, we do build that portfolio to ensure we are playing at a variety of price points and making our products accessible.

But if I were to look at the largest opportunities to address growth through value, I would say bulk of them are really in strengthening propositions. And if I look at probably one of our largest core items, which would be Tide liquid, which is a huge, huge business, we're seeing real momentum as we've just significantly improved the product performance. So it's a combination to answer your question.

Okay. With that, it looks like we have no further questions. So just thank you for joining us this morning and look forward to seeing you at CAGNY next month. Have a great day.
