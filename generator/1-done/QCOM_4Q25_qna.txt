[Operator Instructions] First question, which will come from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen.

Joshua Buchalter
TD Cowen, Research Division

Congrats on a stellar set of results in a bumpy backdrop. I wanted to start with the data center business. I realize you're going to provide more details in the first half of 2026, and my questions might get punted as a result. But maybe you could spend a few minutes talking about what you see as Qualcomm's right to win in the data center space? And any details you can provide on the specs of the AI200 and 250 beyond what you were able to offer in the press release when the HUMAIN engagement was announced. And then lastly, on this topic, last quarter, you called out, I believe, a hyperscale engagement. I assume that's distinct from the HUMAIN engagement and any details on timing there?

Cristiano Amon
CEO, President & Director

Josh, thanks for your question and thank you. Yes. Look, we're very excited. I think this is the next chapter of, I think, the process we have been in Qualcomm to changing the company, diversifying the company, expanding our IP. I think that's one of the reasons I think we made acquisitions such as Alphawave. We think there are 2 areas that we outlined that we can participate into the data center. We were incredibly excited about the size of the opportunity in the next phase, I think, of data center build-out where there's going to be real competition. We go from training to inference.

We have been focused in 2 areas. One is we believe we have one very strategic asset in the industry, which is very competitive, power-efficient CPU. That is both for the head node of AI clusters as well as general purpose compute. And then we also have been building what we think is a new architecture dedicated for inference. I think the focus has been increased computer density and simplify the architecture for the data center in terms of increase, I think, performance per watt.

I think it's all going to be about generating the most amount of tokens with the least amount of power, and that's our right to play. We're excited about what we're doing that has been in development. It's something that we're actually doing in a very disciplined manner. We spend a lot of time, I think, with our early experimentation with AI100 to develop the software. And then we're now building AI200, AI250, both the SoC, the card, direct solutions. And I think we're pleased with what we're seeing. We will provide more details on that as you outlined early next year. Specific to your questions, I think we were in discussion with a hyperscaler.

We're very pleased with the outcome of that conversation, and that's going to be part of our update when we provide details on the road map, the performance, the KPI, we'll be able to show details of the solution as well as our customer engagement. We are in conversation with a lot of companies. It's clear the market wants competition for this. But in a typical Qualcomm way, we're just going to be focused on executing and show the products performing. Like I said, this is an exciting new chapter of our expansion. And alongside robotics, those are kind of new opportunities for us.

Joshua Buchalter
TD Cowen, Research Division

I appreciate all the color there and looking forward to the updates. For my follow-up, I wanted to ask about the handset market. So you highlighted your ongoing momentum in the Android space as driving growth in the fourth quarter -- excuse me, calendar fourth quarter in your prepared remarks. There's been a lot of noise, I think, about your lead Android customer potentially looking to use an internal modem more than they have in recent years. Could you maybe just talk about your visibility into your share at that customer? And any sort of share that you would expect to -- how that you would expect that over the next year or so?

Cristiano Amon
CEO, President & Director

Look, thanks for the question. I'm actually -- I want to spend a little bit of time on this because I sense that there's potential for a lot of noise when noise is actually not required. I think, first of all, there is one thing that is happening with our Snapdragon and our premium tier, Snapdragon Android, which has been very consistent, and this is going to happen over the past few years. The premium tier is expanding. I think if you look at the overall market, we have this trend that is very healthy, and the premium tier is expanding and is adding more compute. That is the reason why our Android business, even on a market that is relatively flat, which is the handset market.

We continue to grow our content, ASPs and earnings because we see premium tier expanding. A lot of the upside we have in the handsets is primarily driven by the Android premium tier. Second part is our relationship with Samsung. We have said for a number of years -- a number of reasons, and this has been true in the past, I think, several years that what used to be a normal relationship at a 50% share, the new baseline is about 75% share. And that is always going to be our financial assumption. When we out-execute, sometimes we get more than 75%, on Galaxy S25, we got 100%. Our assumption for any new Galaxy is always going to be 75%. That's our assumption for Galaxy S26.

The next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.

Samik Chatterjee
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Cristiano, you mentioned the -- on the data center side, starting with that, you mentioned the price performance for the inferencing performance that you're trying to deliver. I mean most of the training clusters that we've sort of seen the other incumbents sort of talk about the ranges of installation cost is somewhere in the sort of $30 billion, $40 billion per gigawatt that we're hearing of.

Can you just right size us in terms of when you're thinking about the deployment on a gigawatt basis, what kind of cost performance or price performance are you thinking of relative to these inferencing workloads that you can support on the AI 200 or AI 250? And I'm also trying to get to sort of what revenue implications are for HUMAIN when you sort of deploy 200 megawatts with them? And I have a follow-up, please.

Cristiano Amon
CEO, President & Director

Okay. I'm going to try to give as much color as I can without getting ahead of the update we're going to provide next year. So first, let's just have a broader discussion about revenue. What we said before that we expect data center products to start leading to a revenue ramp beginning in fiscal '28. I think as a result of the HUMAIN engagement and our progress on the AI accelerator, I think we're pulling this forward into fiscal '27. So you should expect now from what we said before, I think data center revenue is going to start to become material in fiscal '27.

So I think that's the extent of what I can provide at this moment. It's about a 1-year pulling. The second thing is we are getting interest. You should assume that companies, they are having to deploy as much compute as they need in the data center for inference, especially now that you see the constraints that you have on power, the constraints that you have on the amount of computer density. I think we have a lot of folks interested. We were not having conversations if we didn't have a solution that is competitive. But we will show the KPIs of the platform, I think, when we have a road map update early next year.

Samik Chatterjee
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Okay. Got it. And maybe the second one, similar to Josh's question. I think, Akash, if I'm interpreting the market's reaction to your strong numbers, there seems to be that concern about what March looks like with the change in share at the primary Android customer. Typically, on the handset side, your quarter-over-quarter decline into March has been sort of this high single-digit pace. Is that still a good run rate with sort of the lower level of share? Or would you sort of guide us otherwise? Because I think that's really what the market seems to be sort of concerned about at this point.

Akash Palkhiwala
CFO & COO

Yes, Samik, thanks for the question. We're not guiding beyond first quarter at this point. But when you look at our strong business momentum exiting fiscal '25, you see the benefit of that showed up in our results also showing up in the December quarter guidance. And so that carries forward into the rest of the fiscal year. The only additional thing I'd note is just a reminder that we expect to close our Alphawave acquisition in the first calendar quarter of '26. But otherwise, I think the business momentum is strong and just a couple of factors that you outlined.

Operator

The next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.

Timothy Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Akash, when you talked about September, you said that the beat was driven mostly by premium Android, but it seemed like it came a little more from your top customer because before you were saying to take like 30% of units out, and that was like $500 million roughly. But it seems like nowhere near that much came out from that customer. So -- I mean, it was kind of barely down year-over-year.

So can you just square that? And then also as part of that, can you speak to how much that customer is as kind of a baseline assumption for December? I think we've seen that the model that has their modem and it's not really selling very well. So I would assume that that's a tailwind for you also in calendar Q4. And then I had a second question.

Akash Palkhiwala
CFO & COO

Sure, Tim. So as we had said earlier, we expected to be in 3 of the 4 models of the phone that was launched. And so that is exactly what happened. And share, of course, is based on what sell -- how sell-through plays out. Specifically on the September quarter question, we already had kind of demand from the customer that was factored into the guidance we gave. So the upside we saw was not from Apple.

It was really driven by Android customers and primarily the premium tier with the launch of our new Snapdragon chip. When you look at the sequential trend as well, as I mentioned, the -- we are forecasting approximately low teens sequential revenue growth in the handset revenue stream for QCT and primarily driven by Android as well. So there is some benefit from Apple, but the primary driver for the growth quarter-over-quarter is actually Android premium tier shipments.

Timothy Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. And then is there any update on the negotiation with Huawei for a license? It seems like it's kind of dragging on a little bit. Can you just talk about that?

Alexander Rogers
President of Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL) & Global Affairs

Yes. This is Alex. Thanks for the question. No, we actually don't have an update now. Discussions are still underway, really nothing substantive to say beyond that.

Operator

The next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.

Stacy Rasgon
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

So you noted the non-Apple QCT revenue was up 18% year-over-year. And even if I take out the auto and the IoT, it's clear that the Android piece was up like pretty strong double digits year-over-year. So am I right in assuming that's all content or primarily content given I don't think units grew that much. And is that the right sort of pace of like further content increase that we ought to be thinking about as we go forward?

Akash Palkhiwala
CFO & COO

Yes. So Stacy, you're doing -- obviously doing the math right. There are 2 primary drivers on this. One is just the mix shift of units up. And so this is a trend that we've seen over the last several years, and it's -- sometimes it's thought of as a developed market trend, but that's not true. It's across all developing regions as well. The devices that are purchased continue to move up, and so that shows up in the benefit to our revenue stream. The second trend is within premium tier. Content continues to grow as we deliver more and more capable chips, and more capable handsets are being delivered as a result of it. And those are the 2 primary drivers of kind of the long-term trend of our handset business.

Stacy Rasgon
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Got it. And if I could have a quick follow-up. Just the Snapdragon Android strength in September and December, is that primarily China? And are there any concerns there? I mean, is that just the timing of the launches? Like any thoughts on pull forward or anything like that. Anything we ought to be thinking about there?

Akash Palkhiwala
CFO & COO

Yes. No, there's no pull forward there. I think what we've seen is all of our -- most of our China customers, actually, all the major customers have already launched devices and the initial reception to the devices have been very positive. We'll see a lot of our global customers launch devices as well later this quarter going into early next year. And so it's just a reflection of kind of normal purchase patterns around the launch of these devices and the great initial consumer reaction to the launches.

The next question is from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research.

Christopher Caso
Wolfe Research, LLC

And a question again on AI data center. And I realize you're going to provide some details coming up, but there's some specs out there, so -- which is why we ask. But from what we've seen what was in the press release was perhaps a different architecture than what we've seen others attack the market with DDR memory, PCI Express in that. Should we interpret that as sort of a first approach by Qualcomm with more to come? Or is this rather a different sort of philosophy for attacking the market? You talked about being more efficient on power consumption. Is this sort of a different -- attacking the market differently than what's in the market today?

Cristiano Amon
CEO, President & Director

I think the answer to the question is yes. For us, I think we're approaching this thinking about what the future architecture should look like. We had said before, and I think that's -- we have thought about this for the edge as well, which means when we think about dedicated inferencing clusters and the goal is to actually have the highest possible computer density at the lowest possible cost and energy consumption to generate tokens, we thought that maybe an architecture that is beyond the GPU and what you've traditionally been doing with GPU and HBM is what we should be doing. That's we're developing and we have to execute, and that's the focus on the company right now.

Christopher Caso
Wolfe Research, LLC

Got it. With -- just back on handsets. And you talked about a mix shift towards the premium tier. To what extent has the growth that you've seen in handsets been driven by Snapdragon ASPs? And obviously, wafer prices are going up as you go to finer geometries. Maybe talk about the impact of higher ASPs on handset growth, both now and going forward and how the industry absorbs those higher ASPs?

Akash Palkhiwala
CFO & COO

Yes. So I think there's a long-term trend that we've seen. This is a conversation that we have every year, but we continue to see just very strong demand for more capable chips, more capable processing in these premium tier chips. And so the competition between the OEMs drives it, the demand for consumers doing more activity on the phone drives it. And we know the next couple of chips that we are making, and we're already in discussions, advanced discussions with our customers.

So we feel pretty confident that there are legs to this trend over the next several years. The second factor that I outlined is important to keep in mind as well is this very significant mix shift towards more premium devices. And that's not about content growth within the tier, but it's more about more capable devices being purchased by consumer. And that is a multiyear trend as well that we're continuing to see going forward.

The next question is from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America.

Tal Liani
BofA Securities, Research Division

If I look at this quarter, you grew handsets by 14% and it looks like next quarter, you're guiding again 600 basis points of above market growth or above market expectations for QCT. When you look at next quarter, what are the components of this outperformance? Do you -- can you go over kind of IoT, autos and handsets? Where do you think you can perform better than you initially thought last quarter, et cetera? Can you give us a little bit of a color on how next quarter is behaving of the QCT breakdown?

Akash Palkhiwala
CFO & COO

Tal, just to confirm, your question is about the December quarter, first fiscal quarter?

Tal Liani
BofA Securities, Research Division

Yes, first fiscal quarter, sorry. The question is about the guidance for next quarter. Yes.

Akash Palkhiwala
CFO & COO

Yes, perfect. So in -- specifically in automotive, we had a record quarter in September, so $1.1 billion -- approximately $1.1 billion, and we are guiding flat to slightly up in automotive. We do think that we're in this very strong position as additional cars get launched with our capabilities in them, we will continue to grow revenue through the year. IoT is similarly positioned, right? We saw significant upside relative to our guidance within the September quarter, and we are positioned to continue to grow revenue starting first quarter going into the rest of the fiscal year as well.

Within handsets, the upside that you're seeing in the December quarter is really the success of our launch of our new chip. We've seen all the major OEMs launch devices with it. As I said earlier, strong consumer reaction, and that is reflected in our financial forecast. On a sequential basis, as I mentioned earlier, we are forecasting a low teens sequential revenue growth in the handset stream in QCT.

Tal Liani
BofA Securities, Research Division

And my follow-up is on a -- like historical perspective, when you launch a product into China and it's into the New Year's -- the Chinese New Year, et cetera, is first fiscal quarter the strongest quarter? What happens from a seasonality point of view, what happens for the next few quarters from a historical perspective?

Akash Palkhiwala
CFO & COO

I mean, as you've seen in the past, we expect our first fiscal and second fiscal quarters to be the stronger quarters in the year. And usually, the June quarter, the third fiscal quarter is a lower quarter. So that's -- seasonality should be consistent with what you've seen before in the handset business.

Operator

The next questions come from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald.

Christopher Muse
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

I wanted to kind of focus on QCT EBT margins and revenues grew 5% year-on-year, yet margins were down 100-plus bps. And I'm curious, is that a function of mix? Or is that a function of higher manufacturing costs? Or is it simply R&D investments for future revenue growth?

Akash Palkhiwala
CFO & COO

Yes. I think when you look at the year-over-year trend, I think you should think of we are investing in the data center area, which over the last several years, we've been kind of just focusing OpEx on moving from mature businesses into growth areas. Data center is incremental to the investment profile that we have.

Christopher Muse
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

Okay. It's very helpful. And then I guess just to hone in on your non-Android handset business. Is there an update in terms of how we should model that for calendar '26?

Akash Palkhiwala
CFO & COO

No change to what we've said on share within Apple versus what we've said in the past.

Operator

The next question comes from the line of Ben Rises with Melius Research.

Benjamin Reitzes
Melius Research LLC

Just wanted to touch back on the data center event, you said you're going to be updating us in the next calendar year. Previously, you had an Analyst Day where you've put out these long-term targets for FY '29. I would assume that the smallest opportunity was in XR at $2 billion. I would assume if we're going to have an event and go through something like this, this has the opportunity to be something pretty material, bigger than the smallest opportunity outlined at the last Analyst Day, that was $2 billion for XR by '29 and more like another multibillion opportunity. Can you just -- can you guys clarify that?

Akash Palkhiwala
CFO & COO

Yes, Ben, that's a great observation. I think we're seeing this market take off very fast, especially AI smart glasses. And so we definitely feel like we're significantly ahead of the guidance that we had provided and very significant upside opportunity. I mean if you kind of step back and think about the broader opportunity around personal AI, and you could think of it as the glasses form factor or the watch form factor or hearables form factor, this could be a very, very large market. And so if that plays out as we suspect it might, it will create significant upside opportunity.

Benjamin Reitzes
Melius Research LLC

Yes. Sorry, just to clarify, though, my question, I appreciate that is that if you're going to outline the data center opportunity and have a special event, should we assume that it's a multibillion opportunity, something that you would call out that's at least as big, if not bigger, than anything you laid out at your last Analyst Day, which is the smaller opportunities are $2 billion to $4 billion.

Cristiano Amon
CEO, President & Director

Ben, now -- thanks for the question. I understand it now. Yes, it's upside on that number and success in this area, I think, presents to us a potential multibillion-dollar revenue opportunity in a couple of years, and that's how we're thinking about it right now.

Operator

That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Amon, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?

Cristiano Amon
CEO, President & Director

I just want to thank all of our partners, our employees, and we are continuing to change Qualcomm into a very diversified company. We're probably one of the few companies among all the semiconductor companies that can go from 5 watts to 500 watts with very flexible and very broad technology capabilities. I think one thing that we take pride of in every industry that we enter, we have a platform that is a leading technology platform, and we're excited about the future of the company, and we're just going to keep executing on this strategy. Thank you very much for supporting our call.

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.
