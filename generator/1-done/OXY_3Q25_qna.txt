Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Doug Leggate with Wolfe Research.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
Wolfe Research, LLC

Vicki, maybe the first question is for Sunil, actually. It's on the capital guidance that you just talked about there, the soft outlook. If I'm doing the math correctly, so you dropped about $300 million from the beginning of this year, so you $7.2 billion. But $900 million was chemicals, as I understand it for next year.

And I believe this year was $450 million on DAC. So that's about $1.35 billion. I'm trying to kind of get to the range for next year. So if you add back the $650 million you talked about, are we in the ballpark to think that spending next year should be down about $700 million on your -- based on your remarks, Sunil?

Sunil Mathew
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So Doug, you're right on the way you're approaching it. Like you said, midpoint for CapEx guidance for this year is $7.2 billion. Chemicals was $900 million. So you back out that, you're at $6.3 billion. Like I mentioned, we are going to increase CapEx in the Gulf of America waterflood projects and Oman, which is around $250 million, which will be largely offset by the roll-off of capital in our low-carbon venture portfolio. So you're back to the $6.3 billion.

And with respect to U.S. onshore, like I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are looking at potentially investing up to $400 million. So you start with $6.3 billion, and it could be somewhere between $6.3 billion to $6.7 billion, depending on the macro environment. And the other thing I would highlight is, like I said, with this increased spending in U.S. onshore, a proportion of U.S. onshore CapEx as a percentage of the total CapEx will increase. What that means is a lot more flexibility if the macro is going to become more unfavorable. And so that is one important thing.

And I think like Richard said in his prepared remarks, the way we think about capital allocation for U.S. onshore, if you were to adjust our capital program, I mean, first, we look at our efficiency, both operating efficiency and what we're seeing in the market. Second is potentially how we can defer some of our facility spending. And the last thing would be in terms of activity. So I think from a capital point of view, you're looking at somewhere between $6.3 billion to $6.7 billion with a larger proportion of U.S. onshore CapEx where we have a lot more flexibility.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
Wolfe Research, LLC

The Street is obviously very smart, Sunil, because it's sitting at $6.5 billion right now. So that's really helpful. My follow-up, if I may, is for Richard. I'll take advantage and also wish him congratulations for your new role, Richard. I'm thinking a Permian field trip might be in the offing, but we'll take that one offline.

My question is, you did say you've added 2.5 billion barrels of resource mostly in the Permian. You've obviously got -- it looks like sector-leading drilling per lateral foot cost now. And clearly, the breakevens in the Barnett are coming down. So my question is you haven't given us a resource -- drilling backlog or a breakeven for the sustaining capital for the portfolio. So I wonder if you could address those. Where does this leave your drilling inventory? And what would you say is the sustaining capital breakeven at this point for the portfolio?

Richard Jackson
Senior VP & COO

Doug, this is Richard. Great to hear from you and appreciate that for sure. Always enjoy our Permian visits. Let me start just sort of addressing generally why resources. I think for a long time, we've been trying to characterize our strong unconventional resource base. And the way to do that was to talk about drilling inventory and think about breakevens against that.

I think as we look forward, as we're explaining today, we're so much more than that. We have our big opportunities in our conventional assets and just felt like moving to more of a resource explanation was a better representation of what we are and the value that we have. If we sort of break down that 2.5-billion-barrel Permian add, most of that -- much of that is coming from continued unconventional shale improvements. And in our view, this is technology. This is using our subsurface characterization to continue to fine-tune our design, especially around the secondary benches, which we felt like was important to point out in this highlight.

It includes things like the Barnett where we had an existing position. Much of that Barnett resource runs into our Central Basin platform where we've operated in our enhanced oil recovery business unit for a long time. And so much of that continues, and that would be a direct translation to the drilling inventory that we've disclosed previously. But the other piece is the EOR. And we highlight the unconventional EOR today, but also across our conventional position.

And so in total, we just felt like that was the right way to think about it. In terms of the Barnett, obviously, a big piece of that becoming competitive in our portfolio is the drilling cost improvement and just very pleased with the progress by the teams in the Midland Basin for what they've been able to do, but we're seeing that across all of our basins. I think we highlight in one of the slides about a 14% total reduction in well cost across all of our unconventional drilling, same in the Rockies.

So in general, that's improving our resource base. And so I think going forward to the breakeven, we'll continue to characterize that resource base with a breakeven. I think we've talked about our projects for the year, our annual programs are all less than $40 breakeven. And so on a project basis that we expect that to continue. And like we've shown in the past, it's always improving the resource, expanding it, yes, but improving is the most important component of it and cost is a big part of that.

And our next question today comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.

Arun Jayaram
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

My first question is maybe on Slide 16. Perhaps for Richard, I was wondered if you could maybe give us more details on the demonstration pilot. It looks like in this example, you're highlighting CO2 injection around 3 years after initial production from the well. But I was wondering if you could just talk about the applicability of this on older wells that may have been completed 6, 7 years ago. And maybe just a little bit about the math around the 2 billion BOE resource opportunity, that would be helpful.

Richard Jackson
Senior VP & COO

Yes. Great. I appreciate that question a lot. The example we're highlighting on that slide in the Midland Basin, it was with CO2. These wells were originally online in about mid-2015. So your question is perfect. While they apply to historic wells like we're showing here, they also apply to more recent vintage as well, and I'll walk through that math in a second.

But just a little bit on that pilot. Again, that's about a 45% uplift. We had 5 injection cycles that were completed over those 3 years, we stopped and saw this 45% uplift. If we modeled out continued cycles of CO2 injection, this is where we get to the 60% and even 100% production uplift. And so that's where that comes from. If we look at the 2 billion barrels, if you think about recovery factors in the 8% to 12% with unconventional, if you look at this 45% to 100% uplift, now you're talking about reaching recovery factors in the 15% to 20%. So that is likely a little bit more for the oil and perhaps a little bit less for the gas in an oil reservoir.

But if you look across the derisked unconventional acreage where we have this opportunity, that's how we began to account for the 2 billion barrels of unconventional EOR. As I mentioned, we've got 3 projects that we'll be working into commercial development over the next couple of years. Those are really spread between New Mexico, Texas, Delaware and the Midland Basin. So again, it's sort of an approach that can be applied to multiple areas.

And then based on this technical work, we have another 30 development-ready projects across these basins that will be ready to develop. And so again, as we think about the role of mid-cycle low decline cash flow in our outlook, we believe these can be very meaningful as we look forward into future years.

Arun Jayaram
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. That's helpful. My follow-up is Sunil mentioned that you could redirect $250 million of capital from the reduction in LCV capital back into the Gulf of America for waterfloods in Oman. I was wondering if you could provide some thoughts on the -- what you believe these waterflood projects can do to your productive capacity in the Gulf of America. Maybe just thoughts on Gulf output as we think about 2026.

Kenneth Dillon
Senior VP and President of International Oil & Gas Operations

We now have 2 waterflood projects, FID and GoA. These will result in improved recoveries of nearly 150 million BOE and significant reductions in decline rates over time. Potentially, these could lead to GoA declines going from 20% today to 10% in 2030 and 7% by 2035. So a significant impact on the base.

First up is at the King Field, which is a tieback to Marlin. There will be a dump flood, which requires very limited facilities. That will be on stream in Q2 next year. This will lead to a potential extension in field life of around 10 years. At Horn Mountain, we've used the latest OBN seismic with our in-house developed tools to place the first injectors. 2 will be drilled in Q1 2027. And in parallel, facilities will be installed in Horn Mountain, leading to a target injection date of Q2 2027 and an expected response date during late summer 2027.

We've been ready to go for some time and all the long lead items have now been placed. Returns expected to be in the 40% to 50% range for these projects. So overall, last time I talked about improving well performance, this time talking about lower decline. And as you can see, we've had improved reliability, both on rotating equipment and general facilities.

We were aided by the weather a bit, including, I would say, being able to get through a lot of fabric maintenance work in this time period. So overall, still working on next year's plan. Part of that is tying the construction activities for the waterfloods to the planned maintenance required offshore so that we only take the platforms down once and have multiple staggered turnarounds.

And our next question today comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.

Neil Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

This is an important time for STRATOS as you guys are ramping this project up. And so as the rubber hits the road, I just wanted to understand what the gating items are and early thoughts around start-up activities.

Kenneth Dillon
Senior VP and President of International Oil & Gas Operations

Yes. Overall, the STRATOS Phase 1 start-up is proceeding well. Since we last talked, we've commissioned the central processing unit with water. Another major milestone was achieved that was starting up the process compression facilities, which are required for CO2 injection. Siemens Energy team, I have to say, including the CEO and the execs have been incredibly supportive of the project. This is a large complex machine, which basically started up first time.

We've now started loading the first fills of pellets and chemicals and continue to start up the other unit operations. So the next up are the centrifuges and then after that is the calciner, and these are the 2 remaining unit operations before we export the CO2. We continue to optimize each of the units during start-up as we always do. And while that does cost us some time now, it will pay tremendous dividends going forward. Priorities are to learn for long-term capture efficiency and uptime. So overall, we expect to be circulating KOH this quarter and injecting CO2 in Q1.

Neil Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And I had a couple of questions around just return of capital as the follow-up. And so I think following the OxyChem sale, I think investors definitely recognize the value in improving the balance sheet, some of the concerns that we heard was about the legacy liability. So I guess this will be the first time you have an opportunity to maybe address that and help people get comfortable around that.

And then while I know that you can't knock out the preferreds until August 2029, is there an opportunity to opportunistically repurchase shares before them to help alleviate some of those concerns. I just want to give you an opportunity to address both of those.

Vicki Hollub
President, CEO & Director

Okay. With respect to the return of capital, we definitely want to take out the -- all that we can, the $6.5 billion of debt first. And then beyond that, we are going to opportunistically buy back shares. And we -- and it has to make sense. It's a value calculation for us to determine whether to do that or whether it's best to take down some more debt or put more into the business.

But one thing with respect to the use of cash, I want to make very clear to everybody, and that is that we're not going to aggressively put lots of extra barrels into an oversupplied market. So when we're talking about the possibilities here on the call, I want you to understand that we definitely have plans to be very flexible in that. And I think Richard may have an opportunity later to share more on what that's going to look like.

But we are going to stay within our means in terms of using the cash that we have, but not taking down too much cash off the balance sheet. We'll try to maintain about $3 billion to $4 billion on the balance sheet as we go forward. And the legacy liabilities with respect to OxyChem, the bulk of those liabilities are outside the operating areas that were purchased. And there's very little cash being spent or any necessary activities beyond what's already happening within those assets -- operating assets that were bought. Everything else is outside. It made no sense to -- for those liabilities to go.

And what they're costing us is right now somewhere in the neighborhood of $20 million or so on an annual basis. The liability that's the largest, of course, prosaic, but that prosaic it's going to be spread over 20 to 30 years. So this is going to take a lot of time to develop that and to work that. And so this really has minimal impact on us to maintain these. It's really not material to what we do. And the repo -- the Berkshire, you want to talk about the Berkshire, Sunil?

Sunil Mathew
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. So Neil, like again, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, now that we've got a debt target below our goal of less than $15 billion. And as Vicki outlined, we're going to be opportunistic with respect to share repurchase. It's going to be driven by the macro conditions, where our stock price is trading, cash on balance sheet because our ultimate goal is to start or resume the redemption of the preferred once we get to August 2029.

So what you're likely to see is as we get towards August of 29, we're going to start building up cash on our balance sheet. So there is no formula as such in terms of share repurchase, but we're just going to be opportunistic, considering or keeping in mind that by August 2029, we want to build cash on the balance sheet.

And our next question today comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Sunil, can I just clarify that in your 2026 CapEx, you're saying that you're going to redirect, say, $250 million from the LCV into the Gulf of America and Oman? So that means that LCV we're not going to spend any money at all? And also that, I think for Richard, can you talk about the $400 million that on the quick payback onshore project, what kind of production contribution we should expect for 2026?

The second question is exploration. With your resource, it seems like you are finding more ways to get resources from the onshore market. So if that means that exploration will remain sort of like not the most important aspect for your program over the next several years?

Sunil Mathew
Senior VP & CFO

So Paul, with respect to LCV CapEx for next year, we think it's going to be around $100 million as we roll off capital with the completion of STRATOS.

Richard Jackson
Senior VP & COO

Yes. I'll pick up a bit of the scenarios with the potential $400 million that Sunil talked about. I mentioned in my remarks sort of a target initial plan of $55 to $60. And what that means is really, if you think about continuing activity this year, that would be up to that $400 million that Sunil talked about.

So actually flat in terms of resources that we would go from this year into next year. In terms of what that makeup for next year might look like for EOR, it's actually -- it's light. It's about $100 million between EOR and unconventional EOR. And so it's fairly light next year. And it's actually pretty capital efficient as we look in the out years because we're not drilling wells, we're using CO2 in terms of the recovery.

But I also want to highlight, we work scenarios below the $55 plan. And that's one of the advantages of the allocation of capital into the U.S. onshore. We have plans that go below $50 to be able to adjust to really carry Oxy in total in terms of cash flow to meet a breakeven and obviously cover our uses of cash.

So we have that mapped out. We've done it in the past. That's why we wanted to go into some detail on the thought process of how we react to lower oil prices. Obviously, we like to work through efficiency first, but we do have that activity flexibility in our operations, especially in the U.S. to adjust in lower oil price scenarios.

Kenneth Dillon
Senior VP and President of International Oil & Gas Operations

And then following up in GoA, we are -- we've already started deferring some exploration from next year into the following years. And in Oman, these are not really big exploration. These are step-out wells very close to our existing facilities, which can be brought online incredibly quickly.

Operator

And our next question today comes from James West at Melius Research.

James West
Melius Research LLC

So Vicki, maybe a bigger picture question for you. A lot of moving parts the last several years with Oxy, lots of changes in the portfolio. You've been busy is the key here. With the OxyChem sale, are we going into now a quieter period, maybe a harvesting type of a period?

Vicki Hollub
President, CEO & Director

Absolutely. And I'm thankful to be at this point finally. Yes, we've gone through -- there was a lot, as you said, going on, but this is where we wanted to be, and this is where we needed to be. So we've done everything that we set out to do with respect to being mostly a U.S. company with very high-quality, high-margin assets and assets that can sustain over the long term.

And we think that our portfolio is so much differentiated from anybody else because we not only have the high return but high decline shale, it's complemented and will be complemented in the future by the conventional assets and conventional EOR, along with unconventional EOR. And when we look at where our portfolio stands today of the -- our production, where we -- our total development, 45% is conventional and 55% is unconventional.

Going into the future, we have a ratio of -- looks like about of the total $16.5 billion that we have in resource, about 65% is unconventional, 35% conventional. But the beauty of the unconventional is what Richard talked about, and that is the fact that in the unconventional, we are going to be able to do -- use CO2 for enhanced oil recovery in the unconventional.

It's going to recover, we believe, up to the same amount as primary production. So we'll get 100% of what we got before. So we're doubling our total recovery from the unconventional. So that will be actually low decline as well over time.

So we think that versus a pure shale player or versus those that have assets that are difficult to manage internationally and in foreign countries, we think that we're much better positioned with this portfolio. So yes, we're done with anything that's -- any big acquisitions or anything like that.

Operator

And our next question today comes from Matt Portillo at TPH.

Matthew Portillo
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, LLC, Research Division

Maybe just a question to start out on the DJ. You highlighted in Q3 strong well performance drove upside to your production figures. I was curious if you could just maybe comment on in the Rockies, if you've changed anything on the completion or spacing design? Or what's really driving the outperformance there?

Richard Jackson
Senior VP & COO

Yes. Thanks. A big part of that beat really the last couple of quarters has been our base production. And so a lot of work we've talked about in the past, we've been doing around artificial lift, even using some analytics to improve our efficiency on that. So that was the biggest part of it.

We have had better new well performance as well. I wouldn't call it major changes. We just continue to tweak sort of our subsurface designs and our flowback. The base actually -- the production operations that support the base also help our new well production. And so a lot of that new well beat is just better uptime on some of our processing facilities.

Matthew Portillo
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, LLC, Research Division

Great. And then maybe just a follow-up on the inventory. I was wondering if you might be able to comment on your views around your DJ inventory and how you might be able to flex capital in kind of a lower commodity price environment, just thinking through kind of the remaining locations left and obviously, some of the upside that you've highlighted here in the Permian, how you can flex capital between those 2 basins?

Richard Jackson
Senior VP & COO

Yes, that's great. Yes, we've been largely working in the DJ around an optimized activity set. We've had a couple of rigs and one frac core. And so that's been a big piece of it, continuing to show efficiencies, like I said, on well costs earlier. I think in the Rockies, as we look to the future, excited about the Powder River Basin. We continue to make progress there. We sort of have been working similar to the way I've described the Midland Basin, where we -- first, we're sort of proving out the productivity of the wells really in the '23, '24-time frame.

And then in '25, we've had a partial rig year where we flexed the rig up to the Powder River Basin. We've had really drilling record after drilling record up there. We've improved about more than 25% versus the last year in terms of drilling performance. So that was a bigger part of it. And so now really, as we look to '26 and beyond, we have that opportunity to flex from the Rockies to the Powder River Basin. And so again, I don't really see an increase in capital, just more optimization in terms of that portfolio for the Rockies with that.

Operator

And our next question today comes from Neal Dingmann at William Blair.

Neal Dingmann
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

My question is just on the low Permian well cost that you all showed for maybe for Richard. Is the larger projects contribute to that? Or what was the main driver of that exceptionally low cost?

Richard Jackson
Senior VP & COO

Yes. Great question. We've been on this mission in the last couple of years to really relook at both the operational efficiency of our operations and working, like I mentioned earlier around our contracts and service contracts. And so it's really been a bit of both. I'd say the scale in the Midland Basin certainly helped. We were able to combine really the best of the best from Oxy and our CrownRock -- legacy CrownRock team and really just worked on that piece of it.

But the scale certainly helped. So I do agree with that. But from an efficiency or from a contract standpoint, I think we were also entering a period where we made sure we were getting the right contracts for the right type of work. And so we've done a lot of work on that. We're fairly short right now in terms of contract term. And so we're working hard with our partners there to kind of think about how it looks going into 2026 and making sure we got those 2 pieces put together correctly.

Neal Dingmann
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Great point. And then just a follow-up, Richard, you talked a lot on the conventional EOR today and the amount of possible recoveries there. I'm curious, what type of returns? I assume the returns around some of that incremental upside would be very positive, I would think, correct?

Richard Jackson
Senior VP & COO

Yes. We highlighted 25% to 35% kind of where we're at today. And so if we're able to increase the uplift like we're talking about, those are only going to get better. So the goal, obviously, is to be competitive in our portfolio. And so the teams will be working on that. And that -- again, that's the beauty of the portfolio that we have. It's not so much the expansion, but it's the competition to make sure that we're putting capital where best placed for the returns that we want.

Operator

And our final question today is coming from Leo Mariani with ROTH.

Leo Mariani
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

I really appreciate all the details on '26. You certainly talked about the range of capital, $6.3 billion to $6.7 billion. Very helpful. Can you give us just some high-level indications of what would you kind of expect production to do in that range? Is that kind of a maintenance range for production maybe at the lower end and maybe you see a modest amount of growth at the high end? What can you kind of tell us about kind of associated production?

Sunil Mathew
Senior VP & CFO

So in terms of production, you would be looking something close to flat to potentially up to 2% growth.

Leo Mariani
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

Okay. That's very helpful. And I guess any specific areas that largely kind of unconventional that kind of provides the growth for next year? Is that kind of the flex piece is really that $400 million, which I guess is mostly unconventional Permian?

Sunil Mathew
Senior VP & CFO

That's right. So the growth will be largely driven by unconventional Permian.

Richard Jackson
Senior VP & COO

Right. And as I mentioned, the flex down will go after efficiency first to maintain activity, but in position to be able to cut activity as required based on the macro.

Operator

Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Vicki Hollub for any closing remarks.

Vicki Hollub
President, CEO & Director

Before we close, I want to express sincere appreciation to the entire OxyChem team for their steadfast commitment to safety and operational excellence. Their achievements have contributed significant value over the years, and we're confident that OxyChem will continue to thrive under new ownership. So thank you all for your questions and for joining our call today.

Operator

Thank you. Today's conference has now concluded, and we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.
