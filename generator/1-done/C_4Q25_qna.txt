[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.

Glenn Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And Mark, you're the best. You deserve a sit on a beach for a little while.

Mark Mason
Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Glenn…

Jane Fraser
CEO & Chair of the Board

Not yet.

Glenn Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Not yet, not yet, but exhale at some point. Okay. I have a question in Markets. And I feel like markets is one of the big pieces of the puzzle to get to improved returns. So it could be just one quarter, but I see the flattish revenues in the quarter. You talked about a tough year-on-year comp. Let's more focus on the interesting, PB bounces up around 50%, allocated capital about the same trading assets are up like 23%. Loans are up a bunch. It's -- I'm curious on how those things are growing while allocated capital is the same and yet the RoTCE in the quarter is like 6%. So this is just a couple of things that make my head scratch a little bit, so I just need a little help there.

Mark Mason
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, look, I'd point to a couple things. So first of all, you can see the top line revenue for the full year up 11% for Markets. So very strong performance. The fourth quarter was very strong last year, so it's a tough year-over-year comp. But we're seeing particular momentum over the course of the year in parts of the franchise, like spread products where we've been doing more around financing and lending activity, and that is a very optimal use of RWA. It's very high returning, low RWA for us. Similarly, that momentum in equity is supported by prime with equity of 13% for the full year.

And a lot of the action that we see in 2025 is on the heels of having spent a lot of time optimizing RWA in the prior years and ensuring that we're deploying it where we get the highest return for it. And so we come into the year with lower levels of capital. We set that once for the year. We've allocated more GSIB capacity towards the business and allocated more higher returning use of the balance sheet towards lending activity, and those things have contributed to the higher RoTCE that we see here for all of '25. So a combination of optimization of balance sheet and deploying balance sheet in higher-returning areas of the franchise.

Glenn Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay, all helpful and good perspective. And then this is a small one. But on the expense and efficiency, Slide 20, and correct me if I'm wrong, I thought the last look was efficiency ratio below 60%, and now it's -- we're targeting around 60%. It's -- in the grand scheme of the Citi story, I don't think it's a big deal. I'm just curious if it changed, if it meant to change. Or am I reading that wrong?

Mark Mason
Chief Financial Officer

No, you're reading it right, Glenn. I think -- look, I think the -- it's a couple things. Your last point is well taken as well. In the grand scheme of Citi, like what are we talking about? But let me make the bigger point, which is, in '26, as you know, we are focused on ensuring we deliver on the 10% to 11% return, right? That means top line momentum, good expense discipline. But in that expense discipline is both creating capacity through greater productivity, bringing down our transformation costs, et cetera, and investing in the business, right? And that investing in the business point is a really important one because Jane has said a number of times now that 2026 is just a waypoint. And in order for us to ensure we're delivering greater returns in '27, '28, et cetera, we have to continue to invest in the franchise. And so what you highlighted as a less than 60%, moving to an around 60% is giving us the flexibility to ensure that where we see the opportunities to invest beyond '26 that we're taking advantage of those. Does that make sense?

Glenn Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Yes. Yes, it makes sense, and I appreciate it.

Your next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.

Michael Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Jane, if you could elaborate on the new data point that over 80% of your progress with transformation is at the target state or near the target state. What remains and out of what remains, how much of that relates to safety and soundness?

Jane Fraser
CEO & Chair of the Board

Yes. Thanks, Mike. Well, while we have some more work to do, let me just say, I do feel really good about where we are. As you remember, the audits mainly revolved around 4 areas, so compliance, risk, controls and data. And we're operating at almost as our target states. These are the Citi defined ones for compliance, risk and controls. And in data, we've significantly accelerated progress over the past year, and some of that's really been helped by AI as well. And we're seeing this translate quickly into both outcomes, and that's including the detailed accuracy of our most critical regulatory reports and in the modernization of our underlying data.

So we're focused on completing the work, and we have a finely tuned execution machine that's delivering on time and at the appropriate quality. And I am highly confident in our ability to get the remaining work done. I think we all took it as a positive sign that our regulators are also seeing demonstrable improvement in Citi safety and soundness, and that's publicly evidenced by the OCC's termination of the July '24 amendment.

Ultimately, the timing is up to the regulators. Getting the work completed is just the beginning of the end, as it were, and we need to get comfortable that the works delivered the desired outcomes. It needs to get validated by our independent audit function and then the regulators go through their assessment and closure process. That all takes time. But from the shareholder perspective, we're beginning to see the benefits of the investments we've made in our transformation. We're becoming more efficient, as you can see on the back of many of these investments. We're far better controlled. And as we complete each body of work, we're beginning to bring our expenses down. And to Mark's point earlier, that creates the capacity for additional investments. It creates capacity for higher returns in 2026 and beyond. And I would also say it frees up some more management mindshare for growth and innovation.

Michael Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And correct me if I'm wrong, I think you were at the end stage for risk and compliance, but now you're saying at controls, you're mostly there.

Jane Fraser
CEO & Chair of the Board

Yes.

Michael Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So that's new. So we're really left with regulatory data, which -- and again, correct me, to me, that sounds like regulatory box checking, the sort of thing regulators have talked about, they're deemphasizing. So if you've addressed a substance and what remains has nothing to do with regulatory box, anything to do with safety and soundness or customers or anything like that. I don't know why the regulators would still have the consent order on after 6 years. So I guess are you the bottleneck of the process then? You just have to kind of validate what you've done in internal audit and then turn it over to the regulators, if that's the case, how long does it take you to validate your internal process?

Jane Fraser
CEO & Chair of the Board

I wouldn't go quite as far as you've jumped to. We still do have some work to do. We're very focused around it and we're making good, accelerated progress with it. But yes, we have to get the work done, validate it, and then hand it over to the regulators in the process we talked about. So all of those things have to happen, and I'm confident that we'll get there in good shape.

Michael Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And one little attempt, when you hand it over to the regulators, are we talking months, years? What are you thinking?

Jane Fraser
CEO & Chair of the Board

That's up to them. They have to answer that one. That very much lies in their hands.

Operator

Your next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.

Ebrahim Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

I guess maybe 2 questions. One, Jane, just following up beyond the regulatory piece, what would you say? I think one of the concerns investors have is Citi was behind the curve in terms of franchise investments. You've done a tremendous job over the last 5 years where -- how would you respond to that? There is a gap between Citi and best-in-class peers when we think about investment banking, capital markets, et cetera, how would you size that gap? And what is needed and how long to narrow that gap or if, in fact, eliminate that?

Jane Fraser
CEO & Chair of the Board

So you're right. Over the past 5 years, not only have we been investing in technology and the transformation, but also in innovations and making sure that we are positioned to drive our growth in our returns and our competitive position. In terms of services, we are the leading firm in a #1 position. We've been building out digital asset capabilities, really expanding product innovations as you've heard us talk about, Payments Express, real-time liquidity and other always-on digital solutions. And we're investing in scaling our security services platform and broadening capabilities there, and you saw the huge growth in the assets under custody and management this year that we've achieved as a result.

So service is in a very strong position. Markets where we've been investing as we continue filling product capability gaps, we're improving capacity, we're reducing latency, increasing resiliency to support the 11% growth that you saw this year and in particular areas like prime which had huge growth of 50%. But we're always looking at where are the new capabilities that can get added on in FX and equities, spread products, rates across the board.

Now in Banking, you saw our prior talent investments driving share gains. So we saw sponsors, an area of focus up 180 bps, Lev Fin up 100 bps, M&A up 90 bps. And we're going to continue to bring in top talent to fill remaining gaps that we have notably in North America. Wealth retooling key areas of investment product platform with the open architecture is the key operating principle. So you've seen us retool the research product. We've been investing in deploying new AI-powered capabilities to drive continued momentum in client investment assets and investment fee revenues. And then finally, in cards, we're driving engagement and growth with new innovative products, our commerce platform launches and refreshing -- various refreshing of different offerings so that we can complement the suite of proprietary cards, we can broaden out our marquee partner relationships.

So all of this investment is making us feel that we're in a very good place to compete. Our goals, as we talked about, is to be the leading player, top 3 or top 1 in all of the businesses that we're engaged in. It's very important for us that we invest for the long term and not just looking at this on a year-by-year basis. So that's the mindset we have if that helps you and you can see we're making progress.

Ebrahim Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

No, that's helpful. And maybe, Mark, one for you. Appreciate you moving away from revenue guidance but maybe help us fill in the blanks a little bit around when we think about fee growth, maybe there's about 6% ex-Markets when we look at 2025. Just how we should think about fee revenue growth embedded in your expectations around that 60% efficiency ratio? And any color on markets NII of at least what the puts and takes should be in terms of delta versus the $10 billion-ish that we saw in 2025?

Mark Mason
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, sure. So first thing is, we did have good fee growth this year. We'd expect that to continue as we think about 2026. Now keep in mind the 2026 banking wallet was north of $100 billion and so we expect a constructive wallet. We'll see what that looks like, but we also expect continued share gains against that constructive wallet. We've got a rich pipeline as we go into the beginning of the year. And as Jane mentioned, we've been investing in key parts of the franchise that will continue to pay dividends for us in '26 and beyond. So that will be a positive contributor to fees as we think about 2026. Similarly, we're expecting continued momentum on the investment revenue side of wealth as well as on deposit.

But in investment revenues specifically, as it relates to your fee point, we saw good growth in client assets up about 14%, good growth in NNIA up about 8%, and that momentum is expected to continue in '26 as well. So that will be a contributor to fees. And then you've seen throughout the year good KPIs in our Services business and in both Securities Services as well as in TTS with U.S. dollar clearing volumes and cross-border transaction value, but also on the securities side with growth in assets under custody and assets under administration. And we'd expect that momentum to continue, particularly with some of the big wins we've seen on Securities Services side in North America in particular. So the combination of those things, I think, will be positive contributors to NIR as we think about 2026.

I've been pretty consistent in stressing the importance of thinking of the Markets business from a total revenue perspective. And I would stick to that point. With that said, I think that one way to think about Markets is probably relatively flat year-over-year. Subject to what the wallet is, revenues should be somewhat flat year-over-year. But again, off of strong momentum that we've seen in 2025 and obviously, mix will matter there. What I will point out is that we have seen meaningful growth in the spread products and financing side of the business and that obviously does show up in part through NII inside of Markets. And so hopefully that gives you some sense, but again, feel good about the NII ex-Markets outlook. 5% to 6%, that'll be both volume and mix. And on the volume side, I'd expect to see loan growth in cards and wealth probably in the mid-single digits in terms of loans and deposit growth in Services and Wealth probably in the mid-single digits in the way of volume there as well.

Operator

Your next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.

Betsy Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So Mark, I had a question for you on the NII outlook. Coming into this print, I think you were looking for a slowdown in NII growth from 2025 levels of 5.5%, but you actually increased the NII outlook to 5% to 6%. And I know you mentioned also that you took some actions to reduce asset sensitivity. So maybe we could wrap this all up into what drove that better NII outlook.

Mark Mason
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Look, it was -- the NII guidance that we gave last year, we came in a lot better than that in 2025, and that was in part due to the higher loan volumes that we saw, the higher deposit volumes that we saw throughout the year. And in fact, that is what is informing the 5% to 6% ex-Market NII guidance that I've given for 2026. We'd expect the loan volume to continue. And as I mentioned -- I'll correct what I said earlier, I expect loan volumes to probably be up mid-single digits for total ex-Markets loans.

And that'll be, again, a combination of growth that we see in cards. We saw good volume growth in cards this year, particularly on the branded side. We had good purchase sale activity up 5% in the quarter, all signs are that we should see that continue and good loan growth on the Wealth side, particularly in security-based lending type activity, which is tied to some of the investment momentum. And then really impressive growth in deposits, average deposits for TTS for the year we're up 6% and good operating deposit growth there, a nice healthy balance between North America as well as internationally.

And so the long-winded way, Betsy, of saying the momentum that we've seen in cards, in loans, we expect to continue into 2026, and that's a big driver, big factor in that NII momentum we're showing on the page. And then as you mentioned, we've been -- I've been mentioning it pretty consistently quarter-over-quarter. The way we've been managing the investment portfolio that we have is such that we have, in this case, in '26, about 30% of those securities maturing, they're maturing at lower rates than we're able to redeploy them at including in loans and cash and securities and other instruments. And so that's going to give us a bit of a lift as well. So it's the combination of those things that give me confidence around the 5% to 6%.

Betsy Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then just on the actions to reduce asset sensitivity, does that play into this at all? Or what actions did you take?

Mark Mason
Chief Financial Officer

We took some -- you can look at our IRE analysis and if you look at it pretty -- it's been pretty consistent in that we've been managing the portfolio in a very dynamic way. If you look at it as of the third quarter, our U.S. dollar IRE for a 100 basis point drop is $300 million, right? And so we've taken a number of actions as it relates to the nature of securities that we hold and exiting those in some instances to make sure that we're reducing the asset sensitivity given that we know that rates are likely to go down. And so most of that sensitivity is in the non-U.S. dollar part of the portfolio, which, as you know, represents more than 65 currencies or so. So it's active management of the balance sheet, things you'd expect that we would be doing in order to manage the direction of things that we expect.

Betsy Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And congratulations for me as well. And enjoy your 2026 into '27.

Mark Mason
Chief Financial Officer

Thank you so much, Betsy.

Operator

Your next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.

James Mitchell
Seaport Research Partners

And Mark, I think everyone appreciates your efforts over the years. So good -- definitely good luck with your new -- next chapter.

Mark Mason
Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Jim. I appreciate that.

James Mitchell
Seaport Research Partners

Yes. Just maybe on the capital return side, you're 160 bps above your minimum CET1. I guess, number one, are you still targeting a buffer around 100 bps? And if so, how quickly are you looking to get there? Just trying to get a sense of the pace of buybacks from here over the next few quarters and the year.

Mark Mason
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. No, thanks for the question. We are, as you say, about 160 basis points above. We are still targeting 100 basis point management buffer. And as -- what that would obviously equate to is us getting closer to a 12.6%, as I think I said in my prepared remarks, where over the course of the next number of quarters we'll be working our way down towards kind of a 12.6% which would represent that 100 basis points. We're not giving guidance on buybacks quarter-to-quarter, as you know, but as you look at what we've done in the year at $13 billion or so, I think you can expect that we would look to do more in 2026 in the way of buybacks.

James Mitchell
Seaport Research Partners

Okay. That's helpful. And just maybe on just the deposit growth in Services, it has been very strong. It sounds like you're pretty confident in the outlook there. Can you maybe kind of just dive into a little bit more on the drivers and why you think that should be sustainable going forward?

Mark Mason
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. And look, I think the team has done a really, really good job in TTS, in Securities Services at first, ensuring that our clients appreciate that what we bring to bear is more than just deposit taking in the breadth of our offering, particularly around multinational clients. The second thing that I'd say is there has been a focus on, as we work with those clients around the world and they look at new markets to enter that we are right there by their side, ensuring that we can help them move and manage their cash and liquidity needs in an effective way. And that focus and continued dialogue has manifested itself as -- in growth in operating deposits for our business, particularly this year.

The third thing I'd mention is that there's still, I think, a significant opportunity as it relates to commercial and middle market clients. And the team is very focused on with a -- I think, a growing front end on how we capture more share with that client base. So the combination of doing more with our existing multinational, bringing on new clients and targeting what is a relatively nascent segment for us gives me confidence, not just in '26, but in beyond '26 in our ability to have some continued momentum here.

Your next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS.

L. Erika Penala
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I didn't plan to ask this question, but this literally just hit the Bloomberg. Bilt just unveiled credit cards capped at 10% and will maintain those rates for a year and it will be applicable only to new purchases. Obviously, a tiny player, but I'm just wondering, obviously we all know the many reasons why this shouldn't be capped in perpetuity, including really curtailing credit to those that need it the most. But is this going to be the end game, you think, Jane, in terms of these demands and sort of the push for affordability? I know this is all new, but...

Jane Fraser
CEO & Chair of the Board

Yes. Happy to tap in there, Erika. Look, let's start with -- we applaud the President's focus on affordability. Everyone agrees that for many Americans are pressing concerns and escalating costs that require immediate attention. And we're always interested in collaborating with the administration to put in place more effective solutions that are going to foster the expansion of accessible and affordable credit to those who need it most. And today, we provide our card customers with lower-cost products. Think of the no fee Simplicity card or our balance of transfer offers. And I'd also note, we were the only big bank to eliminate overdraft fees, amongst other measures. And we're very proud of our role as the leading financier of affordable housing in the country for the past 15 years when you look at the bigger picture.

But to your point, a rate cap is not something that we can support. I think the reception from the Hill also seemed less than enthusiastic from what we could tell. And just to be clear, the impact to us and other banks would just be dwarfed by the severe impact on access to credit and on consumer spending across the country. These things just don't work out as intended. And think back when the Carter administration put credit controls in place to reduce costs, the impact was so severe they were very swiftly rescinded within 2 months. And I think it's helpful to have a few pieces of data.

For context, U.S. consumers spend $6 trillion on their credit cards every year, and outstanding U.S. credit card balances are over $1.2 trillion. They grow about $80 billion a year, and there's over $4 trillion in untapped capacity at risk. So if you make these products unprofitable, that spending will be drastically reduced, and that's British understatement. And we've seen this in -- as other countries have experienced when they've tried this. And also the studies in the U.S. have shown a vast majority of consumers and businesses would lose access to credit cards. They'd be forced to pursue more predatory alternatives and you'd only be left with the wealthy having access to credit cards and nobody wants that. We'd also see some of the domino effects ricocheting through retail, travel, hospitality sectors, much broader impact on GDP. So as I said, what we want to do is engage on how we can expand credit rather than restrict it to those who need it. And that's our goal.

L. Erika Penala
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Very clear. And my real question, and I'm going to try to smoosh it into one. You talked about the progress in the consent order amendment getting lifted and Jane, you talked earlier about as you hit your end state, your target end state expenses come off. As we think about the entirety of the consent order lifting, is it a gradual expense savings? Or is there sort of a giant chunk that could be reinvested? And the sort of follow-up question is just on EB's question on market NII. Mark, I know that your market's NII is probably less volatile than that of your peers and I know you want us to think of markets more broadly, but I'm just wondering as we sort of square your markets -- sorry, your NII ex-Markets guide with consensus, is it prudent to, as a placeholder, put in what you earned in 2025 into 2026 in terms of markets NII, but perhaps with upward bias?

Jane Fraser
CEO & Chair of the Board

Yes. So you snuck in a few different questions there, Erika.

L. Erika Penala
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Sorry.

Jane Fraser
CEO & Chair of the Board

Let me just quickly touch on what does it mean for our -- what does it mean as we get different bodies of work, I think different from some others, we begin to see the benefits of the investment we've made, and we begin -- and we become more efficient on the back of the investment. But as we complete each body of work, we begin to bring the expenses down related to that and that's what creates the additional investment capacity and will help us drive returns. So it's not as if it's a cliff at the end of the consent order. You're beginning to see us doing this as we get work completed, bringing that expense down and then redeploying that either to the bottom line and as well as to the investments that we need for growth.

And maybe just before I turn to Mark, just in terms of long-term return trajectory because I think it's -- we haven't talked as much about it, and we're looking forward to doing so at Investor Day. But when we're looking at our longer-term performance, there's really going to be 3 drivers of higher returns: the revenue growth, the expense efficiencies and our RWA and capital efficiency. On the revenue side, you've seen us and we're very proud of this, you've really seen us steadily grow revenues over the past few years.

2025 is the condition of -- continuation of that and that will continue going forward. Services will grow with new and existing clients, including the opportunity Mark just talked about with commercial clients as well as further product innovations that opens up whole new revenue streams as we've seen in e-commerce. Markets continue to grow in prime where you've seen very high growth from us the second leg to our derivative capability as well as high-return opportunities in financing and securitization, that's now over 70% of our spread product business. And you -- and we'll continue filling in some of the areas that we've got with different client bases and others to continue driving growth. And I would note that we now have 4 $5 billion businesses or over $5 billion in Markets as opposed to the 4 $4 billion ones we've talked about.

Banking, you saw the proof of the pudding this quarter, gaining a fuller share of our clients' wallet and just systematically building out the areas we've had gaps and driving our productivity. Wealth is about scaling up investment penetration with existing and new clients and also the value that we can see from the integration with U.S. retail. Cards continue growing proprietary products and platform innovations. We have the American Airlines renewal, we're really excited about for next year and all the different expansion of the offering there and our momentum in co-brand offerings, as Mark referred to in his introductory remarks, and then a lot of synergies between the businesses.

Mark talked about where the expense efficiencies will come from in the second leg, the benefits, the investments in our transformation and the technology that we've been doing as well as the increased productivity, the stranded cost removal, et cetera. He's run through where you'll continue to see the expense efficiencies coming through whilst we also make the long-term investments. And then I'm very proud of our business leaders. They've been really unrelenting in the optimization of resources in RWA and capital, and we're hoping to see some reductions in our capital requirements as we saw with the SCB results going forward.

So there's a lot of potential both for the continued revenue growth, the durable return improvement in the years ahead and you'll obviously get a lot more detail at Investor Day. But I think it's important to put this in the context of the long term where we're headed rather than just the nitty-gritty of the short-term pieces here.

Mark Mason
Chief Financial Officer

Erika, if you're not excited about Investor Day after that, I don't know what will excite you.

Jane Fraser
CEO & Chair of the Board

We're excited about it.

L. Erika Penala
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I know I need to pick out my outfit right now.

Mark Mason
Chief Financial Officer

That's right. That's right. All 5 of these businesses are humming. So we're pretty excited. To your question on Markets, here's how I think about it, Erika. So what I said earlier was that total revenues, you can assume that Markets revenues will be flat in 26%. I think that's pretty consistent with what consensus has right now. If you wanted to try and parse it within that flat, I think your instincts are probably right that NII, I would forecast to be up within a total revenues of flat if for no other reason, as Jane mentioned and I mentioned earlier, the more work we're doing in financing, and securitizations are likely to lead to higher NII in market as we think about '26. And I appreciate your starting point in the question, which was that our Market's revenues tends to be more steady. And I think that is true and a byproduct of our model, our client coverage and our business mix. So -- but thank you. See you at Investor Day.

L. Erika Penala
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Yes, and good luck for your next adventure and hopefully you don't spend too much time at the beach before we see you at another leadership role at another financial institution.

Jane Fraser
CEO & Chair of the Board

You're going to see him at Investor Day, that's for sure.

Operator

Your next question will come from John McDonald with Truist.

John McDonald
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Just to follow up on the last thing, maybe just summarize it on the efficiency journey. Fair to say that both you have plenty of expense flex to deliver the efficiency improvement to 60% this year. And also that the 60% is a waypoint itself. It's not the destination for your efficiency ratio. Are both of those fair?

Mark Mason
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Look, the way I think about it, yes, we have flex is the bottom line. So if revenues come in, come in softer, we will dial back expenses accordingly. Importantly to make sure we get to 10% to 11%, right? So I don't want to lose sight of that point, John, I'm not avoiding your question. The answer is yes in terms of flex point. But we are focused on ensuring we deliver the returns of the 10% to 11%.

In terms of the long-term operating efficiency, I'll leave that for Investor Day to talk about. And again, the reason I'm saying that is because we want to invest, we need to invest in this franchise, right? The earlier question that was asked in terms of closing the gap versus peers, this is not -- these are not businesses that you can invest once and be done with. They continue to evolve. They require continued investment and working of them. And so I don't want to sit here with you today and tell you that operating efficiency goes to some number that's significantly lower without giving you the full context of how we think about the next couple of years, and that's what Investor Day is about. But, Jane, I don't know if you want to add anything.

Jane Fraser
CEO & Chair of the Board

Yes. And I think you're also hearing confidence from us on our ability to do both. AI has been an additional benefit. I talked a little bit about what we're doing with our over 50 processes in the prepared remarks that will be driving new sources of efficiency that 3, 4 years ago we didn't -- we couldn't have imagined. And we see that ability then to bring the efficiency down and drive our returns up and grow the franchise going forward. And you're hearing the confidence from us to be able to do that and frankly the excitement.

John McDonald
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's fair. And then one quick follow-up. Mark, could you give a little more color on the outlook for the card NCLs? The range is the same as last year, but the mid upper end of the range implies a little bit higher losses than the actual 2025 loss rates, particularly on retail services. Are you just allowing for some macro uncertainty by keeping the ranges? Or is there anything in the delinquency roll rates that you're seeing?

Mark Mason
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Look, there's -- to answer your question with the latter part of it, as we look at delinquencies, we're not seeing anything unexpected in either of the portfolios. And even when we cut it by different FICO scores and income brackets and the like. And so are there things out there that could have an impact over the course of the next year? Sure. Does the range give us some cover around some of those things from an NCL point of view? It does, which is why we're sticking to the range. But there's nothing that I see right now.

Your next question will come from Ken Cassidy with RBC. I'm sorry, Ken Usdin with Autonomous Research.

Kenneth Usdin
Bernstein Autonomous LLP

Just one for me. I know we're going long here. Mark, the services deposits last year were just really strong. And I just wondering if you could tie that into just the broader macro economy and rates and are you continuing to still expect that, that part of the business can still generate that level of deposit growth?

Mark Mason
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, sure. So for deposits, total deposits for the firm next year we're expecting mid-single digits. As I look at Services for 2025, as you said, we were up about 7%. Big part of that TTS was up about 6% year-over-year and Securities Services were up about 12%. I do expect to see continued strength there despite -- as I think about growth from, as I mentioned earlier, more with the large multinationals, more with some of our commercial middle market clients, I think a particular emphasis in growth in North America is what I would expect. We've been very thoughtful around pricing, obviously as rates have declined. And remember, we've got good loan growth and so we want these deposits to come in. It's a lower cost of funding for us and we see opportunities to deploy it at good margins and help drive our returns. And so this has been about ensuring that we're managing these clients with a client relationship mindset, which includes the deposits, but also all the other things we bring to bear for them.

Your next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.

Gerard Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Mark, you're leaving big shoes to fill, so good luck in your future endeavors.

Mark Mason
Chief Financial Officer

Thank you so much, Gerard.

Gerard Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Jane, you guys have done a good job moving the ball down the field in divesting your presence in Mexico. You talked about it today. Can you share with us where we are in terms of -- I know market conditions will play a factor once you get all the regulatory approvals to do the IPO. Can you share with us where we are on the regulatory part? And then second, will you guys give us the announcement that all the regulatory approvals are in? And now it's just market conditions. You've got the green light and you're going to wait until you think it's right.

Jane Fraser
CEO & Chair of the Board

Right. Okay. Well, look, first of all, we had a great outcome for all parties involved with the accelerated closing of the sale of the 25% stake to Fernando Chico Pardo. And the Mexican president and [ HUD ] government have been publicly and privately very supportive of both our path forward and of Fernando as the anchor investor. And I think we saw that with the record closing of that stake. Normally, it would take 9 to 12 months to do. So we're very pleased with that.

We are focused on the next step in the exit process and we're actively looking at selling some additional smaller stakes as we lead up to an IPO. And as we said, and you refer to the actual timing and structure of what we do is all going to be guided by several factors. That includes market conditions with the ultimate goal of maximizing value for shareholders. But that 25% stake that we've just closed is a much bigger opening position than it would be if we had IPO-ed. And so I think the next step is going to be some smaller stakes, and we'll keep going from there.

Gerard Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Very good. And then just a real quick follow-up. Mark, you talked about Markets, you talked about equities, the strong comparison to a year ago, how prime balances were up nicely this quarter. But in the cash equities business, what was the weakness there? I know you identified it, but what was it inside cash equities?

Mark Mason
Chief Financial Officer

Again, I think it was more of a year-over-year comparison. We had a really strong fourth quarter in equities last year, and that was a big driver.

Jane Fraser
CEO & Chair of the Board

Yes, we had a very big -- we had a couple of very big alpha trades. And so if you strip that out, it looks much more in line with what you would expect.

Mark Mason
Chief Financial Officer

Yes.

Jane Fraser
CEO & Chair of the Board

If you have a great fourth quarter, it comes back and bites you.

Your next question will come from Saul Martinez with HSBC.

Saul Martinez
HSBC Global Investment Research

I just have one and I'll show you some love as well, Mark, best of luck and we will miss you on these calls.

Mark Mason
Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Saul.

Saul Martinez
HSBC Global Investment Research

The Wealth business, net interest, NIR was down 1%. I know that was -- that reflected the sale of the trust business, but op leverage was minimal. The EBIT margin was pretty much the same as last year. Net new assets still good, but a little bit softer. I'm just curious how you're thinking about the progress there, your level of confidence that you're on track to continue to drive higher op leverage. And if you could just remind us what the end goal is for op leverage, for EBIT margin, I should say, and over what time frame do you expect to get there?

Jane Fraser
CEO & Chair of the Board

Yes. Let me kick off and I'll pass it back to Mark. Look, we had a good quarter in Wealth. It was capped off a year of real continued improvement and our revenues are up 14%. The RoTCE is over 12%. We grew client investment assets 14% on the back of 8% organic growth. So a lot to like there. What's the strategy and the direction that Andy is taking this, right, is to be the lead investment adviser for our clients has been a lot of our focus. So we've been attracting, retaining industry-leading talent, strengthening the CIO research product with Kate Moore doing a fabulous job there. A lot of retooling of key components of the investment product platform and some impressive partnerships that are really going to differentiate us with industry leaders like BlackRock, iCapital, Palantir, which means we're going to have a -- we have a really superb open architecture platform and a far better client experience.

And all of this is helping us drive and accelerate growth in investment fee revenues over the next few years. That's the famous $5 trillion of us opportunity, $3 trillion of that is with clients in our U.S. retail and Citigold business, which is why the integration, the retail bank makes so much sense. But we're clear there's still more work to be done. There's room to grow profitability and revenues from here. And Andy's going to lay out the path at Investor Day. So you have the clear sets of KPIs and different elements that are needed to continue to drive that growth forward. But we remain committed, and we see the path to improving the returns of the overall business to above 20% in the long run. Mark, what else would you add?

Mark Mason
Chief Financial Officer

The only thing I'd add, and I do think, as you pointed out, Jane, we are seeing good momentum and feel very good about the momentum we're seeing on the investment side. And frankly, the opportunity with the wealth of our clients that sit in our retail banking footprint is still a significant opportunity for us that is largely not yet tapped. Your question around margins, the medium-term EBIT margin that we set for the business was about 20%. So when you look at 2025, we're there. The longer term is 25% to 30%. And so we still have some headway to make. And as Jane mentioned at Investor Day, we'll be mapping out how we intend to get there.

The final question will come from Chris McGratty with KBW.

Jane Fraser
CEO & Chair of the Board

Chris, we're leaving the best till last.

Christopher McGratty
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

No pressure. Thanks, Jane. Related to Investor Day, I'm interested when the management team is getting together in the room and discussing the communication of the new targets, does the level of profitability or the timing to which you get there carry more weight? I ask because the market seemingly wants a little bit higher and sooner, but I'm also sensitive to the bar you set in growing into the targets.

Mark Mason
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I would say both are important, right?

Jane Fraser
CEO & Chair of the Board

Yes.

Mark Mason
Chief Financial Officer

I mean, look, clearly 10% to 11% is not sufficient. It shows demonstrative progress since the last Investor Day, but we're clear minded that when we're creating value, we're doing so with returns that are well above our cost of equity. And so being able to grow the return level is critically important. And if you know anything about Jane, you know the sense of urgency in kind of making things happen quickly. So without committing in any way, I would say both are factors as we think about the forward look for the firm. But Jane, why don't...

Jane Fraser
CEO & Chair of the Board

Yes, I mean we want to have our cake eaten. Not good on calories. What can I say?

Operator

There are no further questions. I will turn the call over to Jenn Landis for closing remarks.

Jennifer Landis
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you for joining the call. But before we wrap up, I just wanted to briefly echo what Mark shared earlier about Citi and thank him for his leadership as the CFO of Citi. His focus on transparency, performance and long-term value creation has set a very high standard for Citi. And I personally want to thank Mark for his mentorship and guidance over the years. So thank you. And thank you all for joining, and I'm sure I will talk to you this afternoon.
