Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global.

Daniel McKenzie
Seaport Research Partners

So premium is clearly outperforming leisure today. So my first question really starts there. And that is that premium seats today, I guess, are 25% of the total flying. But I'm wondering what percent of revenue they comprise and what you would expect that to be when you exit 2027? So I'm thinking it's probably 30% plus today, and the question becomes, could it be over -- could premium revenue be over 40% of revenue in 2027?

Martin St. George
President

I'll take that, Dan. Thanks for the question. So we generally have not released that number. And I think as premium becomes a bigger and bigger pack, we'll have to think about how we want to manage that in the future. The one thing I do want to stress is that with the introduction of the domestic first-class products later on this year, the total percentage of premium seats is not going up dramatically. That product is basically being funded from reduction in the EvenMore cabin. However, the quality of the seats actually goes way up and as does the yield. So it is absolutely accretive.

The benefit of domestic first class is clearly in the products and perks initiative under JetForward. And we're really excited about just continued momentum we've seen for premium products, whether it's lounges, Mint, EvenMore, we have a really great track record as far as being able to deliver premium products to our customers. Our customers love them, and we are really excited to introduce first class later this year domestically.

Daniel McKenzie
Seaport Research Partners

Yes, yes. Second question here just ties to leisure revenue and the recovery glide path that the current guide embeds. And I'm thinking leisure fares so far this month are largely flat year-over-year. And I'm just wondering if that full year guide embeds sort of a flattish revenue leisure component or what that recovery -- the shape of that recovery could look like?

Martin St. George
President

So that's a great question. And I will start with the line I use pretty much every call, which is we guide what we see. And the trajectory of 2026 unit revenue is fundamentally based on fourth quarter performance and first quarter bookings. So you'll hear us use a word today that we generally haven't used in well over a year, which is strong. I mean bookings are strong right now. And I think what I'm especially excited about is we've seen a nice recovery of leisure customers and frankly, I cannot talk enough about how pleasantly surprised we've been with the speed of the adoption of our new capacity in Fort Lauderdale. That's been a very nice contributor.

But overall, when you look at our operational improvements, you look at the improvements into loyalty program, the resulting increase in NPS, I think we sort of have a flywheel of goodness going on right now that's resulting in great unit revenue. There are no big assumptions of a GDP snapback quickly, significant changes in competitive ASMs. Basically, we're sort of forecasting based on what we see right now.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore Partners.

Duane Pfennigwerth
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Marty, that word demand strength, which you haven't used in a while. What is different about the trends that you're seeing now? Maybe you could speak to changes in the booking curve. And then for my follow-up, which I'll state right upfront, to what extent is competitive capacity in the first half contributing to that?

Martin St. George
President

Duane, so let me start with the little more color around what we mean by the word strong. I think that the thing that has been most interesting to us is the recovery in the domestic coach market. I made a comment in the remarks about how domestic and international performance has been converging, which I think we're very optimistic about. I'll also say that the booking curve looks very normal. I think if you go back to the middle of 2025, what you would have heard us say in calls was the bookings are coming, they're coming very close in. And there was a little bit of apprehension of you're sort of sitting here with bated breath waiting to make sure the bookings actually came. That's really not what we're seeing now. We're seeing a very normal booking curve.

With the exception of the Caribbean for the first couple of weeks of January, where we did see a bit of a drop, which, by the way, we're back to positive year-over-year RASM in the Caribbean. That was a blip that's been temporal and much better now. It just looks like a normal demand year, which I'm very, very optimistic about. With respect to competitive capacity, yes, and we're in a relatively good competitive capacity environment right now. We have had our biggest competitor in Fort Lauderdale pulled down dramatically. We have not made any assumptions about any further pull-downs or any significant change in competitive capacity. I will say that the first quarter is very clear as far as what's out there right now. I think second quarter still has some time to settle down. We're still selling more in second quarter than we're probably going to fly.

But that's generally what you've seen in the time periods when you've got strong peaks and weak troughs where it appears that there's a sort of a big net strategy and then you win it down a little bit closer in. But there is no -- I want to make it really clear on this call. There is no magic hat with a rabbit at it of some sort of a big surprise that's going to make these numbers. This is just execution of the JetForward plan on top of the existing strength in industry unit revenue right now. That's one of the reasons we're so optimistic about 2026.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James.

Savanthi Syth
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

I was wondering, Marty, just to follow up on Fort Lauderdale. Could you talk about just how Fort Lauderdale might be changing under kind of the current strategy other than just getting bigger? Like are the connections going to be bigger as a result in terms of total system? Just how should we think about Fort Lauderdale once this is kind of fully baked in versus kind of the strategy and set up 2, 3 years ago?

Martin St. George
President

Thanks, Savi. First thing I'll say is I think we should acknowledge Fort Lauderdale is our very first destination. The original JetBlue flight flew from JK to Fort Lauderdale. So we have -- the history of JetBlue in Fort Lauderdale is as long as the history of JetBlue. And we have had a lot of growth in Fort Lauderdale over the years. I think you go back 10 years or so, we announced publicly this concept we call it Fort Lauderdale 140, which was growing Fort Lauderdale to about 140 flights a day. We had trouble executing that mostly because of gate resources in the airport. It is a relatively constrained airport, especially constrained for international gates.

And if you look at the opportunities to grow, we have a pretty solid slate of destinations in the north of Fort Lauderdale. Our challenges are really to Caribbean, Central and South America. And for that reason, the lack of international gates has been a problem for us. I'd say with the pull downs that we've seen from Spirit in Fort Lauderdale, gate resources have become available. And we've won this for many, many years. So when the opportunity came up, we jumped on it very, very quickly to make sure that we could backfill because this is an aspiration we've had for a long time. And I would say that starting with crew members and also investors, we have continually gotten this feedback of you need to diversify beyond the Northeast. And I think if you look at diversification beyond the Northeast, this is it.

I mean, Fort Lauderdale is a great premium market, South Florida, a great premium market, the best premium market in Florida. And obviously, we have a very premium heavy strategy going forward. Number two, geographically, it is a perfect location between North and South. So I think given the franchise that we already have in South Florida, the opportunity to grow there, we're really bullish on Fort Lauderdale. Specifically, yes, we have more of a bank structure in Fort Lauderdale than we have historically for connectivity. And as gates become available, we'll continue to emphasize to enhance that.

And in fact, we are currently in the process of expanding our banking plans there. We don't really want to become a legacy hub-and-spoke airline, so it's not going to that extent. But the extent to which we can create casual connections at good departure times in Fort Lauderdale, we will absolutely take advantage of it. And so far, it's performed very, very well from a connected perspective. I think for those customers who have connected in Miami versus connecting Fort Lauderdale, I think I know which one everybody would pick. And it seems like customers are picking it and Fort Lauderdale has done very well for that.

Savanthi Syth
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. If I might just quickly a follow-up for Ursula. Just on the $500 million that you plan to raise this year, is that reflected in the interest expense guide? Is that -- or is that kind of potentially an increase to the interest expense assumption?

Ursula Hurley
Chief Financial Officer

Savi, yes, the interest expense is included in the $580 million guide. I will note the $500 million that we're anticipating raising will probably dual tranches. So there could be a portion of that raise, which happens early in the year to support the convertible debt paydown that is due in April and then the second tranche of the financing most likely will happen in the back half of the year.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Tom Fitzgerald with TD Cowen.

Thomas Fitzgerald
TD Cowen, Research Division

It's good to see that the premium credit card sign-ups are exceeding your expectations. I was wondering if that's primarily in the New York area, just given the lounge or if you're seeing that kind of throughout the network or in new geographies? Or any details you'd want to expand on there?

Martin St. George
President

It's really throughout the system. And I think it's because the premium credit card itself actually has a great value proposition. And frankly, a lot of our customers touch New York. So even if you don't live in New York, it's generally an important destination. And I think when we get New York and Boston both up, we're really bullish about the premium credit card. It's also has a lower annual fee than other airlines and the bank premium credit cards. And I sort of mentioned this in the script, and we put this in the release, we didn't put it in the script. Our friends at Bain, who do like industry-level NPS scores have now given us permission, we can say that TrueBlue has the highest NPS of any loyalty program of any airline in the U.S. So I think, again, back to the concept of the flywheel, your success sort of breeds success. So we're very excited about the card.

Our partnership with Barclays is absolutely fantastic, and I'm really optimistic about the lounge as a contributor. We are -- and back to Savi's point about Fort Lauderdale, we are exploring whether we can make a lounge in Fort Lauderdale work. It's a pretty constrained airport. So we're not as sure that we have space for it. But if we can make it work and provide a great customer experience, it's certainly something we'll be talking about later on in 2026.

Joanna Geraghty
CEO & Director

I'll just add on Marty's comment regarding Barclays. I think what's unique about our program is we're not competing with the bank's proprietary card. This is fully dedicated Barclays card for JetBlue. And so when you think about the depth of the relationship, and 2 entities really rowing in the same direction, that's very much what you see with the JetBlue Card.

Thomas Fitzgerald
TD Cowen, Research Division

Okay. Great. That's really helpful. And then just as a follow-up on Blue Sky, I was just kind of curious, do you see upside potential to that 75 points of RASM expansion? And then just within the various buckets, do you see the wider funnel from the -- being on their distribution website driving a lot of the gains? Or do you see it kind of split evenly or Paisly? Just wonder if you could kind of break out the different drivers within Blue Sky and Paisly.

Martin St. George
President

Thanks, Tom. Honestly, all those things are important. I mean obviously, Paisly is very, very important. What we love the most about the Paisly upside is that, first, we have really built a better mousetrap with the Paisly platform. And especially important for us is that Paisly is an extremely capital-light way to grow earnings. The only capital there is basically IT capital, and it's de minimis compared to our overall capital expenditure.

With respect to the other upside for Paisly, I do fundamentally believe that the benefit -- excuse me, to Blue Sky, I do fundamentally believe that the benefits of Blue Sky are focused in TrueBlue. As you look at TrueBlue program ability to compete with the big 3 legacy airlines, the biggest challenge we have is that we do not have a full roster of worldwide destinations to earn and burn. And through this partnership with United, we finally plugged that hole. And I think the utility of TrueBlue point has skyrocketed in the last 6 months with the addition of this program.

We're also relatively early along in the game. So I think it's -- we'll see how that works with customers, but I love the value proposition of TrueBlue, and I very much appreciate this relationship with United to make this possible. I do also believe that the mutual distribution is going to be important. I think about places where we offer services that United doesn't, JFK to the West Coast, even when they do eventually enter JFK, and we're not sure where they're going to go, but sometime in '27, they'll be in today, if you want to earn miles plus points from anywhere in New York to the West -- from this side of the Hudson to the West Coast, where we're the only option. I love having those flights on United.com.

And even though United may not have the same direct penetration that JetBlue does, it is a significantly bigger airline. We don't really know the traffic to their website other than what we can pull publicly. But I'd love the thought of all the JetBlue flights getting the eyeballs of all these United customers running United.com all the time. And frankly, I will remind you, we have a very high NPS. So I think when United customers actually get to fly JetBlue, their reaction is going to be, hey, this is great. I can have a great customer experience, and I can also earn my MileagePlus points. So we're really excited about that as well.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.

Michael Linenberg
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Just 2 here. Ursula, just on -- you called out the $6.5 billion of unencumbered assets. And I just -- that seems a little bit higher than maybe what you shared in the past. I thought it was more like $5 billion. And so maybe it reflects some debt paydown or maybe you reappraised, I don't know, a pool of spare engines. Did that -- has that changed at all?

Ursula Hurley
Chief Financial Officer

It did. Good catch, Mike. So the previous number that we publicly quoted was $5 billion. As we were assessing our liquidity needs for 2026, we did go through and update all of our appraisals on the unencumbered assets. So as a reminder, we purchased our aircraft deliveries last year with cash. So those were added into the pool. In addition to that, there's still incremental value on our loyalty program as well. So those were really the 2 main drivers of the increase.

As a reminder, as we look at the unencumbered asset base, the breakdown is about 30% of their aircraft and engines, about 20% of it is loyalty. And then obviously, the remainder is slot, gates and routes and our brand. So yes, we're really pleased to continue to have this cushion and the cushion is a really healthy culmination of assets.

Michael Linenberg
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Great. And then just, Marty, you talked about the LOPA changes with the rollout of first class. When actually do you start selling that first, first-class seat? And how long is that rollout going to take before you get to all of your domestic flights with first class?

Martin St. George
President

So Mike, we're expecting the first airplane to roll out in the third quarter. I mean we're right now in the middle of certification. So we're not ready to pin a date down yet as far as when that will be. And the implementation is actually relatively quick. We'll have 20-something percent of the fleet done by the end of this year. The overwhelming majority will be done by the end of '27, but not all of it, and the rest comes in '28.

And the benefits, it's obviously an important part of the products and perks initiative in JetForward. It will not be fully ramped by the end of JetForward. They'll be continue to ramp in 2028. So we're really excited about it, and we'll be making more specific announcements later on this year.

Michael Linenberg
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. Did you say 20% or 27% by year-end?

Martin St. George
President

20%.

Your next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.

Catherine O'Brien
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

So Marty, you talked about that the Fort Lauderdale capacity is ramping better than expected, less of a drag to fourth quarter. Would you say that's more a function of improving overall demand? Did you see faster-than-expected share shift? Was the competitive response better than expected? Just can you talk about how Fort Lauderdale RASM is performing versus the system? And then higher level, like as you're thinking about this additional capacity in the Mint adds, how do you expect that to impact the medium-term hub profitability versus system profitability in Fort Lauderdale?

Martin St. George
President

Thanks, Catie. I'll say 2 things. First of all, we have multiple databases that help us measure share shift. The one that is the most close in Spirit actually does not participate in. So right now, I cannot tell you if the fourth quarter upside has been share shift or has been simulation. But when we get the DOT data, which should be coming in the next several weeks, well, I think we'll have a better answer for that. So I don't want to get ahead of my skis here because I don't actually have the real data.

I do know that we're certainly carrying a lot more customers than we expected at higher yields than we expected. So whether it came from Spirit or from people coming off their couches, I'm happy to have it either way. With respect to profitability, we do expect Fort Lauderdale to be accretive to our overall system profitability. And frankly, I feel like with the change in the competitive environment down there and also the ability to compete with a tough customer experience in Miami with one of our competitors, just Fort Lauderdale is a very easy airport. It's centrally located in the region. We would not be doing this if we did not think that Fort Lauderdale would be a significant upside contributor to the system. Obviously, we could put airplanes anywhere. We're specifically choosing to put them in Fort Lauderdale for a reason.

Catherine O'Brien
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. Makes sense. Maybe Ursula, one for you. You mentioned you're thinking this year's financing needs will be about $500 million. How sensitive is that to your 2026 profitability outlook? I realize you're guiding to breakeven plus, not a range. But does it look different at breakeven versus above breakeven? And how does the E190 and XLR asset sales help offset fundraising requirements this year, if at all?

Ursula Hurley
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, Catie thanks for the questions. So the first one is we're targeting liquidity to be anywhere between 17% and 20% of trailing 12 months revenue. So obviously, that excludes our revolver as well. So there's a little bit of buffer there just in regards to the operating performance of the business. So I will say I feel really confident based on what we know today in the team's ability to execute on the breakeven or better operating margin. And so as we head into raise liquidity, like I said, we'll target that 17% to 20% range. We'll pivot if we have to. Obviously, we have the very healthy unencumbered asset base to choose from if we do need more liquidity.

I'm pleased that I believe that we've hit peak debt levels last -- so really leaning hard into the EBITDA growth driven by JetForward to help improve the leverage metrics. And then in regards to your cost question on fleet, last year, we had a meaningful amount of fleet transactions, the most impactful being the sale of the E190s. We also took advantage of some market opportunities in regards to engine sale leasebacks. As we look at 2026, we do have about 0.5 point of controllable cost benefit baked into the full year guide. That's really driven by the remaining sales of the E190. So we have about 8 aircraft that we will be selling in the first half of this year. And we'll continue to monitor the markets as well in terms of sale-leaseback opportunities. Hope that answers your question.

Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.

Jamie Baker
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So Marty, I wanted to go back to the question you were answering before Savi's question. You mentioned the rabbit. Can I just confirm, there are no specific assumptions in your full year guide as to what potentially happens with any of your competitors that might be facing, shall we say, a precarious situation at the moment? Is that correct interpretation?

Martin St. George
President

Yes. And I'll give you a little more clarity on that, Jamie. There has been capacity added by some other airlines to Fort Lauderdale with the reduction of Spirit ASMs. Those ASMs are there and they're not going away. So that growth is still there. We're not assuming that, that was temporal. We're also not assuming that Spirit goes through any significant shrink versus where they are right now. I mean our view is we want to make sure that as we give a guide, there's no sort of little secret upside in there. I mean we've been trying to guide this thing very straight for the last 2 years, and we're not going to change now. I mean, obviously, the rumors are out there. I think that there's certainly probably more rumors than they have airplanes, but I don't think there's any upside for us to try to make any assumptions on that.

Joanna Geraghty
CEO & Director

But I will say, Jamie, we do have multiple plans in place depending on the outcome of Fort Lauderdale and Spirit. So we're ready for a number of scenarios to ensure that customers are protected and that we bring the JetBlue product and the offering to more folks in South Florida and beyond.

Jamie Baker
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Excellent. I appreciate that clarification, both of you. And then just round numbers, JetForward's contribution was about $300 million last year, but total EBIT went down about $250 million year-on-year. So that implies simplistically that your core was down $550 million. Now last year was obviously a tumultuous one for JetBlue and the industry. Do you attribute that entire $550 million entirely to the macro as opposed to any idiosyncratic challenges your franchise was facing?

Joanna Geraghty
CEO & Director

Yes, Jamie, so I'll take that. Yes, we attribute it entirely to the macro. And as we look back at '25, we've been able to isolate out the JetBlue initiatives and the value that they've driven. And if not for the macro, we're quite confident we would have hit our full year guide of -- our full year operating margin guide. So we're actually very excited about '26. This is going to be our year. If you think about the initiatives that we continue to execute in 2025, whether it was operational performance and improved NPS, our premium loyalty benefits like the JFK lounge, EvenMorechanges, the Blue Sky partnership and our network changes. These are all initiatives that are built to ramp over time.

And as Marty mentioned, these initiatives create a flywheel effect where operational reliability and NPS will enable premium growth, which will then strengthen loyalty and revenue. And then you layer in network optimization, amplifying that impact. So we really are excited that this really sets us up for continued acceleration and upside in '26 as we then add things like the lounge, domestic first and the full implementation of Blue Sky. So that's behind our guide for this year. Last year was definitely a step back for JetBlue, but also the industry as a whole. And this team continue to execute, and we look forward to taking advantage of all that execution and more in '26.

Your next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham with Melius Research.

Conor Cunningham
Melius Research LLC

More rumors than aircraft. I'm going to potentially steal that one. The bridge in the deck was interesting to me. I just -- the 50 basis point macro or industry setup, I think, that you got or that you have there is -- I think it feels really conservative. If you could just frame up what you assume there? Like are you assuming that there's some sort of competitive fallout from the Chicago situation? Just any thought process on how you got there?

Joanna Geraghty
CEO & Director

No, yes. So I mean the 0.5 point of base RASM growth is tied to the demand trends we're seeing exiting Q4 into Q1 and beyond. And then obviously, normal GDP and macro inputs. And so to the extent that there's upside, the upside would come in macro, the upside in terms of incremental 3 points of RASM growth for JetForward could come in things like improvements in Fort Lauderdale beyond what we've assumed, premium ramping faster, sort of the flywheel effect really kicking in. So I think as you look at the guide, we guide what we see, and we do not assume any kind of snapback on macro.

Martin St. George
President

I just want to add one thing, Conor, and it's something that I think as JetForward has progressed, we started to feel the tension between the base airline and the JetForward numbers because honestly, it's kind of the same thing to a certain extent. There's a lot of interaction between those 2 numbers. When we laid out the $900 million proposal for JetForward, a lot of those things at other airlines would be normal course of business. So when you say like this is what the base airline is doing versus this is what JetForward is doing, it's getting to the point where you almost can't make those distinctions because there's so much relation between the 2 of them.

We're very, very proud of all the initiatives, and it was a lot of change in a year. But I think that it's tougher and tougher to measure it, I think, as we go forward because the individual JetForward initiatives, other airlines are doing them and that's in their base. So it's just a little bit tough to do an apples-to-apples comparison between our RASM as in JetForward and their RASM without any sort of branded program.

Joanna Geraghty
CEO & Director

But to be clear, if you think there's upside in macro, that's upside to the JetBlue plan.

Conor Cunningham
Melius Research LLC

Got it. Okay. Helpful. And I realize that you're not guiding, including the impact of fern. But I mean, the feedback I've gotten this morning that it kind of derails your 1Q already. So just any thoughts like is -- are the ranges wide enough to assume that you can weather like -- I mean, you canceled 1,200 flights. So I'm just trying to understand the risk to the 1Q outlook already given the weather events that's already happened?

Joanna Geraghty
CEO & Director

Yes, sure. I mean we canceled just over 1,100 flights. We didn't cancel some of the numbers that other carriers are posting. So I think that's an important distinction. And the impact will be proportional to those cancels. So we'll definitely see some pressure on CASM. We'll see some pressure on ASMs. But this hit us, I want to be clear, during a trough.

So when you think about the timing, it could not have come. We never asked for these things. We never want these things, but it could not have come at a better time. And so really proud that the team is executing and getting us back on track. If you see the cancellations today, the number is much, much, much lower. Others still have the impact lingering. And I'm confident that as we move through the week, we'll be back up and running fully.

Ursula Hurley
Chief Financial Officer

I would just add, Conor, like this is -- we're still going to hit our full year guide. I mean this is something that obviously can be weathered within the full year context.

Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.

Ravi Shanker
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Apologies if I missed this. You guys did quantify the impact of the Caribbean shutdown of airspace in the first week of January. But some of your peers have noted that the kind of warnings or the restrictions on kind of flight activity issued a couple of weekends ago, that's had somewhat of a chilling impact on bookings and then the forward curve in the Caribbean. Are you guys seeing any of that as well for the forward view?

Martin St. George
President

Ravi, good question. Thank you. We certainly saw an impact for a couple of weeks. And there's no question that the -- it was a tough time. It was a peak day when we had the disruption. It's New Year's return. So it was an incredibly poorly timed event for us. And we did see a couple of weeks of booking depression, but nowhere near what we heard other airlines say. I will say that our Caribbean is actually very, very diversified. When you think about the size of our operation in Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, we had a lot of markets that were not affected.

Yes, we certainly saw an impact in places like Aruba, Curacao for a couple of weeks, but those have both rebounded and we're back to normal course of business. There is -- I keep using this word debit. I'm not sure that's the right word. We still have a bit of an impact in the first quarter, but for forward-looking bookings, that will be fine. We're actually not worried about it at all.

Ravi Shanker
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Understood. And maybe as a follow-up, just on the lounges. Can you just share early feedback on the GFK lounge so far? Kind of are you seeing any kind of loyalty or any measurable impact from opening that? And also, you said that you're looking at the potential for Fort Lauderdale. Is that just like a one-off given your strength there? Or do you think that there's opportunity for having like a network of domestic lounges over time?

Joanna Geraghty
CEO & Director

Yes. So Ravi, we're not -- we've even gone on like a network of lounges, but we're not there. I mean we are -- GFK has been great, as Marty mentioned in his prepared remarks, 80-plus percent NPS. We're seeing it absolutely drives sign-ups for the premium card. We're excited to bring Boston online later next year. As we think about Fort Lauderdale, we think it's got a great premium base that could lend itself to a lounge. We haven't announced anything yet. But we're really focused on if it makes sense for a particular market, we will evaluate it, but it has to have a strong return and it has to be tied to driving our JetForward initiatives around premium customer.

Ursula Hurley
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, just to clear, Ravi, the Boston lounge is this year.

Joanna Geraghty
CEO & Director

Yes, sorry, I would say like, yes, later this year. Sorry later.

Martin St. George
President

I will say one thing. As we mentioned when we announced this, the #1 thing we're worried about is reacting to the customer feedback of their [indiscernible] of lines. We do have a picture floating around of the first line outside the lounge, and it was a line of people who are signing up for instant approval of the premier because they wanted to get in. So it's doing exactly what we want to do, and we're really, really bullish about it. That being the case, it's a big CapEx investment. We work with Barclays, obviously, to make sure the math works or something like this. But I think the -- given how our network works, which is we have a handful of cities above 30-something flight today, this is not something we're expecting to have in 20 cities.

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.

Scott Group
Wolfe Research, LLC

Marty, your answer on JetForward versus core earnings a couple of questions is totally fair. But -- so you might not like the spirit of the question, but I do have a follow-up. So if I just take the guidance for this year, you're saying the bridge has $310 million of JetForward benefits. And I think if we're doing like -- I think that implies like flat core earnings. So I guess my question is like if base RASM is up 0.5 point and CASM is up 2%, what are the offsets there that keep core earnings more flat? Or what are the upside and downside risks to that core earnings being flat?

Martin St. George
President

Okay. I'm writing it down. I need to go through that math and try -- I wish you get back to you. I want to make sure I understand the exact question. I mean, at the core, overall industry RASM is on a very good trend right now, and that's driving a big chunk of the 2026 guide that we laid out there. And again, back in this issue of what's core for us and what's core for the competitors, there's a lot of stuff that's in JetForward that will be core for our competitors. So it is very difficult to do an apples-to-apples comparison when you look at what other airlines are doing with things like how they price their extra legroom seats or how they price things like their domestic long-haul premium products.

So I think that it's actually much, much tougher than you think to actually split those 2 things apart. I'm really focused on the top level guide, which is the high-level guide for RASM this year. And remember, it's 2 to 5 is our range, and that's on 2.5 to 4.5 in ASM growth. So I think if you look at the combination of those 2 things, we're really excited about this guide. And I think the ability to produce that level of RASM growth with this amount of ASM growth, I think, is a testimony to the strength of the franchise and of the positive output we're seeing from all the changes we've made in JetForward.

Okay. That's -- I think that's fair. So your point is don't get too caught up in the individual bridge, like look at the whole level, look at the big picture, ASM up, RASM up, it's working kind of thing.

Martin St. George
President

Yes...

Ursula Hurley
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I mean, listen, Scott. At the highest level, right, we're projected to grow our up margin by over 4 points, right? Like the majority of that is driven by JetForward. we are, as a company, growing again, which is fantastic. The AOG outlook has improved. And so when you take the powerful combination of the revenue initiatives, growth, the efficiency and execution on the controllable cost structure, I mean, we believe that this is a material step forward in terms of margin progression.

And right now, what we're seeing in the demand environment is strong. The macro is constructive. And so that's why we're super confident in being able to hit this and get on a path to sustained profitability. I mean, step #2 is free cash flow, and we have a path to deliver positive free cash flow at the end of '27, and then we'll turn to improving the health of the balance sheet. So we feel good about 2026 and our ability to execute. We're in execution mode.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Stathoulopoulos with SIG.

Ursula, for whatever reason there's a macro downtick seasonal underperformance, unanticipated seat growth in New York or other markets, what are some of the levers you can pull to still get to the breakeven margins? And I realize that there's some perhaps a lot of leverage here in the fleet and areas like maintenance and fuel efficiency. But what are some of the other, I guess, cost buckets we should consider should macro or seat growth in unanticipated direction?

Joanna Geraghty
CEO & Director

I'll take that. I mean I think if you look back at 2025 and what we did in '25 when we did see that macro step back, I mean, first, we match supply with demand in the trough period. We pulled 2 points of capacity, I mean after it -- and we still hit our annual cost guidance, which I think is a true testament to the team. And then we ultimately made some really hard decisions around discretionary expenses, leadership structure and then other budget cuts. So as you think about '26, if there were a macro step back, we're going to focus on controlling what we can. We're going to continue to execute on JetForward. And then we will pull some of those levers if need be as we move forward. Obviously, capital expenditures, we would relook at that list. So this team is one that has a track record of hitting the cost targets because that is something that we control more so than obviously revenue. And so you'll continue to see us lean into that if there's a macro step back as we did in 2025.

Christopher Stathoulopoulos
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Okay. And then on free cash flow, I think I heard you're targeting positive year-end '27. If you could maybe size that. So assuming you hit all your targets and JetForward, you move within the CapEx profile you outlined earlier, what exactly does that positive look like?

Joanna Geraghty
CEO & Director

Yes. Maybe I'll take that. We're not going out with any guide or specific numbers. But if you think as earnings grow and CapEx moderates, this is going to enable a path for JetBlue to deliver positive free cash flow and ultimately delever the balance sheet over the next couple of years. So first, we need to deliver positive operating margin in 2026. We've got a great plan to do that. That plan takes advantage of everything we built this year and then all the additional initiatives that are layering on in '26. And then that should, hopefully, as we think about exiting '26, allow us to generate free cash flow by the end of '27 and then ultimately beyond that, restoring our balance sheet health in '28 and beyond.

Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.

Brandon Oglenski
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Joanna, maybe to follow up on that. I mean, I know it's been a difficult couple of years here and been targeting breakeven for a while, and there's been some macro setbacks for sure. But how do you think about longer-term profitability of JetBlue once you get to free cash flow and things like that and delevering? Can you get back to ROIC in excess of your cost of capital? Or do you see fundamentally there's issues of scale here that a lot of airline CEOs will talk about just given how important rewards programs have become?

Joanna Geraghty
CEO & Director

Yes. No, we absolutely see a path back. This is all about improving our operating margin. When you think about scale, I mean, there's 2 ways to look at it. One is scale within the markets that you're in. And we continue as we're growing this year, again in Fort Lauderdale, but we continue to focus on trying to ensure that we have strong franchises in our core geographies. And then the Blue Sky partnership is really designed to provide scale to our loyalty program and scale beyond JetBlue for our customers. And so that's our approach.

And I think we look at the initiatives we're delivering, the fact that customers are coming back to us because we've improved operational performance and NPS. We've got a full series of initiatives we executed last year that are fully in ramp this year and then layering on our first-class product, bringing Blue Sky further to life and then obviously, domestic first. So we're really bullish about the next few years. We will absolutely get us back on a path and delivering more than positive free cash flow and restoring the balance sheet in the longer term. And taking it 1 year at a time, the last year was a pretty big challenge for the industry. And so we're being cautious about how we step into this year with a guide that we think is very achievable given the initiatives we have laid out for the plan and looking forward to hitting that breakeven number this year.

Brandon Oglenski
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And I know it's been a long call, but Ursula, you brought up AOG and the GTF issues, which I think is impacting you less now. Can you talk through the financial impact there in '26 and maybe any recourse you're getting from Pratt?

Ursula Hurley
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. Yes. So we're pleased that the AOG situation has improved year-over-year. So we had 9 aircraft on the ground last year, we're expecting mid-single digits this year. It did take over the last few weeks a slight step backwards. We thought we would be in low single-digit land in terms of aircraft on the ground this year. We got a recent update from Pratt. They continue to struggle on the A321 fleet type with supply chain and shop capacity. So we're navigating through it.

It clearly continues to be a dynamic environment for the A320 fleet type. We are still working through with Pratt & Whitney, the compensation. We're focused on getting what we believe we deserve. We are -- given we're such a large customer of Pratt, there could be many forms in which compensation comes through. And in light of accounting treatment, while the settlement is important to us, the amount is not meaningful to whether or not we achieve our full year guidance for 2026. But in the end, improvement year-over-year, allowing us to grow again, we're pleased.

And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn it over to Joanna Geraghty for closing remarks.

Joanna Geraghty
CEO & Director

Great. Thanks so much. I appreciate all the questions. As you can tell, this group is very excited to deliver on breakeven or better operating margin this year, underpinned by what we see as a strengthening macro backdrop, returning to growth. I have to emphasize that very excited about that, constructive capacity backdrop and then all of the JetForward initiatives really coming into a really nice place for 2026 and beyond. So thanks for the call today. And then I'll just end with congrats to the New England Patriots as the official airline sponsor of the [ Pat's ]. This is your year too. Thanks.

Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect.
