Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] For the benefit of all participants on today's call, if you wish to ask your question to management in Chinese, please immediately repeat your question in English. [Operator Instructions]The first question today comes from Tim Hsiao with Morgan Stanley.

Tim Hsiao
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

[Foreign Language] So my first question is about the physical AI because in the past, the competitive advantages of other companies were reflected in several aspects like cost, brand and channels. Just wondering if the management could elaborate a bit more about what aspects XPeng's long-term competitive advantage in physical AI will be demonstrated? And how will the company continuously enhance its strength in these areas? That's my first question.

He Xiaopeng
Co-founder, Chairman & CEO

[Interpreted] I think this is definitely a big question. The traditional way for automakers to make money is completely different from the new physical AI model generated kind of business format. They come from different DNAs. Traditionally, older traditional automakers focus on their own positioning and also about how they target their user segments and then everything boils down to their integration of Tier 1 suppliers and all the other different parts of the supply chain. However, when it comes to a physical AI-generated model, the definition is different. We determine what the -- we -- everything boils down to the definition of the future tech.

It involves full-stack technology capability and also custom integration. For example, the launch of our IRON robot is a great example of that. So that's why different DNA is going to generate different products and different growth momentum. In the future, I believe that cars will be a new format of robotics, and it's going to actually come to the real life in the coming 5 to 10 years as the next generation of robotics in our life.

So traditionally, the integration of supply chain is completely different from what we are looking at right now, which is the physical AI technology integration across different domains and involves software, hardware and infrastructure upgrades, which will lead to a completely new set of products.

As a result, traditionally, software were only a small percentage of traditional car development, whereas right now, it takes up a large part of new product development. And I believe that when you look at our future developments, we are actually going to see more and more physical AI components in the future for car development over 50%, and we are going to see that very, very soon. Thank you.

Tim Hsiao
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

[Foreign Language] My second question is about revenue from the collaboration with Volkswagen. So first of all, congratulations on the project wins of Turing chips at Volkswagen. So may I know from which quarters the related revenue will start to kick in? And how should we think about the trend of the revenue contribution from the collaboration with Volkswagen in December quarter and the full year 2026? That's my second question.

Charles Zhang
Vice President of Corporate Finance and BW Projects

Tim, this is Charles. So in Q3, we delivered a few key development milestones on time. So you probably have seen that the revenue from the technology collaboration increased significantly quarter-over-quarter. And we continue to see that there are a few key development milestones to be delivered in Q4. So we believe that the revenue from technical collaboration in Q4 will be expected at a comparable level we see in Q3 2025.

And then regarding your question on the Turing SoC. Yes, we were -- our Turing SoC was selected by Volkswagen for the 2 B class vehicles we're jointly developing. And we have already started to supply the Turing SoC to some of the -- our partners, the preproduction and verification vehicles. So therefore, the revenue -- we would expect that the revenue from Turing SoC will start to be recognized in Q4 and probably in the small amount. But however, as our jointly developed vehicle SOP from early next year, and we would expect the revenue from the Turing SoC will ramp up with the sales volume of the 2 vehicles we jointly developed.

In terms of the revenue from the technical collaboration in 2026, and we expect that as long as we can deliver the key milestones that are scheduled in 2026, we would expect that the revenue -- the technical -- the revenue from the technical collaboration for the full year 2026 would be comparable to that of the revenue we recognized in 2025.

So I think looking back, we have demonstrated that we can -- well, we delivered the revenue from commercialization of our technology for 7 consecutive quarters. And I think we believe that there are still opportunities we would like to explore to commercialize our technology and also as our CEO, Xiaopeng, mentioned, and we will reinvest such revenue from the licensing or technical collaboration back into our R&D. Thank you, Tim.

Next question comes from Nick Lai with JPMorgan.

Y.C. Lai
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

[Foreign Language] My first question is -- my 2 questions is actually related to humanoid robot strategy and ambition in the longer term. At a recent Technology Day, XPeng demonstrated our first humanoid robot IRON which worked really like human. And can you talk about our technology road map and compare with the comparable peers? And where is our competitive advantage comparing with the peers in the medium and longer term? That's my first question.

He Xiaopeng
Co-founder, Chairman & CEO

[Interpreted] Thank you. Because there are so many robotics companies in the market, to be honest, the technological and product development road map and strategy of XPeng's robotics is moving forward as we expect, according to our own plan. We have paid really little attention to any other differences in the robotics industry to other companies before we launch our own products.

Now when we look at XPeng, for example, our product philosophy is highly theoretical. You can actually -- well, it's highly human-like. That is the goal of developing our own humanoid robot. What's interesting about our product is that we realize that when we incorporate muscles and very bionic skin on to our robots, we actually attracted a lot of people to dare to hug him.

And this is very, very exciting because traditional robots really were not that attractive and appealing for human beings to give them a hug. In addition to that, we also would like to mention that in the future, I believe that across many aspects of lifeline work, we are going to see more and more robots that is working alongside us.

So for the current generation of XPeng robots, last time that we launched it, it was actually the seventh generation, and we are going to begin mass production of the eighth generation of our humanoid robots. In fact, when we look at some of the available robotics in the market, I believe that a lot of them are between generation 3 and 5, which is mainly being driven by joints and all the operation of different hardware.

And when you look at the operation of hardware and software, you can see that the available products in the market look very similar in the way that they walk and they move. And these kind of robots, I believe, are very, very hard or difficult to commercialize in the end. So in the future generations of our robot, we actually have been thinking about what kind of technological route we should be used, and we have fully integrated actually hardware and software driven by integrated AI.

So this time, you can see that the robot that we showed to the market is based on our full-stack R&D capability and cross-domain integration. I believe that XPeng Motors has many advantages when it comes to our robotics and humanoid robot development. For example, our physical AI resources have a synergy effect with our AI cars.

For example, we actually are considering may be producing higher than car grade performance for our humanoid robots. And also our thinking logic on how to conduct business and mass production of our humanoid robot is largely driven by our knowledge and industry know-how in the EV industry.

For example, when we build the future sales and marketing layout and globalization, there's a lot of synergistic effects that we can enjoy from the existing layout with our car sales. Also I believe when it comes to the future robotics development, some company will still -- some of the players will come from auto-making industry. And I believe that XPeng will definitely have a first-mover advantage in this regard because of the data, the SoCs and the capability that we have. Thank you.

Y.C. Lai
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

[Foreign Language] My second question is also related to humanoid robot long-term strategy and operations. And from here to commercialization, what are the key critical milestones that we should be mindful? And from now towards the end of '26, can you remind us what the capacity and expected scale of our human robot operations? And also in terms of use case, by, say, 2030, you mentioned that 2030 we target to deliver 1 million units, can you also talk about the use case in the longer term?

He Xiaopeng
Co-founder, Chairman & CEO

[Interpreted] Thank you. To be honest, IRON's mass production is probably the most challenging kind of vehicle or products I've ever worked on at XPeng Motors, if I have to make the comparison between mass-producing IRONs and other cars because there's still a lot of challenges. For example, our ultimate goal is for it to be easily trained with human language so that it can really help us in various ways, and there's a lot of room for improvement there when it comes to capability integration.

For example, if this robot can walk or run in various safe postures that requires a lot of integration of capability as well. For example, it needs to have all the joints embedded in management and also full coupling of different wiring, et cetera. Also, if we need to allow it to have more generalized kind of dexterous hand movements, well, it will also require a lot of hand-based VLA, which we believe by beginning of next year will be integrated.

We also need to allow it to have that kind of communication and language-based communication capability between the robot and humans. So that also will come from, for example, a lot of VLM and VLT, which is the small brain and large brain kind of modeling capability. But what I'm really excited to share here is that we will start entering the 1.0 stage of our new generation of mass-produced models next month. I believe that in the next 10 months, we'll be able to actually promote the robot development in an orderly manner during mass production. And I think that's the first part of my answer. Thank you.

I think the ramp-up in robot production capacity is much simpler compared to cars. However, the commercialization of robots is indeed very, very challenging. It requires us to look for really new heights of technology and ultimately achieving more capabilities. Therefore, we hope to initially implement in several commercial scenarios included tour guiding, shopping or retail assistance, et cetera.

In 2026, we hope that we actually can see a lot of our own robots working alongside us at our XPeng stores, campuses for the first stage of field testing. At the same time, we are also opening our SDK to more of our partners so that our partners can easily and simply buy our robots and train them for commercialization purposes.

If your question is about future possibilities of scenario application, I think it's going to be even more than you think. For example, for commercialized robots, maybe you can switch their arms and allow them to go into the industrial production scenarios. And when will the robots go into our household setting? I think maybe 5 years' time, we still have a big chance of achieving that. And I hope that through opening our SDK, we can allow more kind of partners to help us tackle those diverse and long-tail scenarios of application so that we can all enjoy a better robotic future and build a better ecosystem. Thank you.

The next question comes from Ming from Bank of America.

Ming-Hsun Lee
BofA Securities, Research Division

[Foreign Language] Why does XPeng choose to launch Robotaxi service in 2026? Could you share your technology inflection point or how fast you lower your cost? And compared to other Robotaxi companies in China, what is XPeng's technology path or business model? What is your advantages?

He Xiaopeng
Co-founder, Chairman & CEO

[Interpreted] Thank you, Ming, for your question. I think that within our R&D strategy, there are 2 key aspects, which are full-stack self-development and also cross-domain integration. I believe that in 2026, we will be actually seeing a collection of inflection points within our own development system. For example, we are going to be able to launch our current models into the Robotaxi configuration of fleets, which, by that time, we believe that the inflection point will arrive. At the same time, our VRM models will continue to offer new capabilities for our future vehicles to be more robotic-like.

In addition to that, our current second-generation VLA can actually train our intelligent driving Ultra cars and also in the future, maybe also train our mass version of cars using the same kind of large model, too. In other words, we have our cross-domain capability based on our robotic development, which really can solve a lot of Robotaxi current limitations, for example, the high cost of production and also the limitation of the mobility destinations.

For example, current Robotaxi now cannot really handle very complicated and complex road conditions and also in residential areas that has a lot of unpredicted scenarios and also a lot of them currently require LiDAR for their perception capability and so on. So in 2026, we hope that by commercializing fully shared L4 capability in our Robotaxi. We actually can have the dual development of the driverless L4 model together with an assisted driving L4 model.

With the launch of both method or road map in the future, I think very soon, it will be proven that XPeng has actually a better commercial logic thinking compared to other Robotaxi companies and that will give us a great competitive advantage. Thank you.

Ming-Hsun Lee
BofA Securities, Research Division

[Foreign Language] So how does the management team think about the commercialization of your Robotaxi business? Especially in the future, what is your planned milestone, for example, like in terms of the number of fleet? Or when will you plan to roll out in different cities or overseas market? And also currently, you already have a cooperation with Gaode, Amap, and could you elaborate more about your cooperation? And in the future, do we expand -- do you plan to cooperate with small partners like other ride-hailing companies?

He Xiaopeng
Co-founder, Chairman & CEO

[Interpreted] Thank you. Actually, next year, XPeng is going to launch 3 different types of Robotaxi models at different price points to support different mobility purposes and demands. In the next phase of development, I believe, with the premise of regulatory approval, our priority is to really get everything running smoothly, when it comes to the whole technological and operation and business model.

So in that scenario, we hope to work with more and more business partner in the ecosystem. For example, Amap will be a great partner. They are going to give us more development support when it comes to traffic and also payment and operation and services, et cetera. That really set us apart from a lot of the autonomous driving OEMs.

And I believe that in the future, for different countries and regions and different steps of development, we are going to actually launch more partnership with different service providers across different lanes. And for XPeng, what we need to do is that we are building our toolbox really well, and we're opening up our interface capability so that we can work more with our ecosystem partners in the future across different countries and cities.

And so once we really get everything up and running commercially in different environments, we can then quickly build our ecosystem. This is one of our considerations. Thank you.

The next question comes from Tina Hou with Goldman Sachs.

Tina Hou
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

[Foreign Language] Let me translate my first question. So first, I would like to understand, over the next 1 to 3 years, do we have a rough revenue estimate or breakdown for our new businesses, including Robotaxi, humanoid robot as well as eVTOL?

Gui Hongdi
Honorary Vice Chairman of the Board & Co-President

Tina, it's Brian. First of all, I would say that for these future development areas, we do not provide any numerical guidance at the moment. Clearly, all those 3 areas, we anticipate volume, scale level production and operations in the next 12 months. For example, the Land Aircraft Carrier from our flying car company is aimed to be delivered to end customers before the end of next year, will be in volume, also scale, which I would say, in the thousands of range.

But the other 2, for example, the humanoid robot as well as autonomous driving Robotaxi, as we just discussed earlier, next year will be actually a year we'll see a lot of operational testing as well as scaling up process to make them ready for large quantity production and use. So I would say the contribution from next year will probably be limited.

But I think the volume we'll expect to ramp up rapidly once the model and the stability of these products is proven in the use, consumer end as well as application end. So the long-term goal of having 1 million per year humanoid robots sort of sales by 2030 is our long-term goal. And that is something that we have good confidence given we see the quick ramp-up in terms of technology as well as multiple application areas in home, in offices, in factory settings.

So with all these future areas, we believe the potential is immense. So at this moment, unfortunately, I cannot give you the exact breakdown as well as precise cost estimates because these are still, I would say, evolving. But I think the overall trend is very exciting for us.

Tina Hou
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

[Foreign Language] So my second question is regarding our passenger vehicles. So wondering if we can get more details on the new models, their segment as well as price segment, both in the domestic market as well as overseas and also do we have a volume target for 2026?

Charles Zhang
Vice President of Corporate Finance and BW Projects

Tina, it's Charles here. I think we believe that one chassis, dual powertrain vehicles present very attractive opportunities. It is also one of our strategic initiatives to expand the volume and the TAM of our -- each of our vehicles.

So I think on November 20, we are launching the X9 with pricing, that will be our first, we call it the Super EREV product to be launched. And then you probably also have noticed that we have -- we already have 3 existing vehicles, Super Electric model, already registered with regulators, and we plan to launch those 3 products in early 2026.

As Xiaopeng also mentioned that we have 4 vehicles -- 4 new vehicles when we launch, it will be equipped with both BEV as well as EREV powertrain options. And those 4 new vehicles are positioned in the different various segment -- various pricing segments we're in. And we believe that, that will continue to enhance our product portfolio in each of the price segments we're targeting.

So in terms of the growth into next year, and we believe that the huge -- the one chassis, dual powertrain vehicle models, the 7 models will significantly drive our growth next year. And also another growth driver we have seen is that the international market will continue to be a major growth driver for us.

With our current products available in the international market, we have already hit 5,000 per month for September and also October, the 2 consecutive months already. And of the 7 new vehicles we're launching next year, 3 of them -- at least 3 of them will go to international market. And so we are confident that the international market volume will continue to be a very important growth driver for us into 2026.

The next question comes from Pingyue Wu with Citic.

Pingyue Wu
Citic Securities Co., Ltd., Research Division

[Foreign Language] I have 2 questions. And my first question is about the new EREV model. And what do we think about the growth potential of our new EREV models in 2026? And my second question is about the humanoid robots. And how do we think about the fuel economy of the humanoid robots since we have implemented some new technologies, for example, the solid-state batteries and et cetera. And in terms of the affordability, will IRON robot be affordable for family, say, like RMB 200,000 or even less?

He Xiaopeng
Co-founder, Chairman & CEO

[Interpreted] First of all, regarding the first question, I think what's interesting that we discover from the sales figures that we gather from -- since the launch of X9 was that the targeted customers and also the actual users of BEV and EREV are quite different. So we believe that we can expect to actually see several times of quarter-over-quarter growth when the new version of X9 actually get delivered, and actually different customer groups, when they purchase BEV versus EREV, they are using the cars across different scenarios as well.

And specifically, what I want to share is that, obviously, BEV and EREV users in different sizes or scale of cars are also different. In larger vehicles, the percentage of EREV adoption is higher, whereas for Class A vehicles, especially smaller passenger vehicles, BEV ratio is actually higher. So I think we'll have to wait for more numbers to show maybe by Q4 and also Q1 next year before we actually can give you a more concrete answer. Thank you.

And the second part of your question, regarding the pricing affordability of robotics, I think, first of all, the pricing logic is very different between cars and robots. When we look at the BOM cost of our Gen 6 and Gen 7 robots, they remain very high last year. But by first half of this year, when we were preparing for true mass production, we actually have enough reasons for us to actually believe the future retail sales price of the robotics -- of the robots can be very similar to car prices.

And the second point that I want to mention here is that the traditional way of pricing a car is weight-based. It involves how many kind of iron and lithium and all kinds of elements included and components included in making a car, whereas robots, it's very different because the percentage of software in a robot is over 50% since day 1, whereas the number is only 10% to 20% for a lot of cars.

In other ways, you have to put in a lot of cost to train the software and the model, and you need to have the overall capability to do a lot of integration and also domain controller as well. For example, you need to be able to combine all 4 SoCs into a super domain controller so that you can make them as light as possible and as affordable as possible.

And these remain very challenging for many industry players. In other words, we really have high hopes for our future when it comes to robotics development. Hopefully, we are going to -- we expect to handle a limited amount of SKU integration, not as many SKU as when you're making a car. And we also will try our best to make the pricing of robots as affordable as possible. So it really can truly help and empower thousands of households in the future. Thank you.

The next question comes from Xiaoyi Lei with Jefferies.

Xiaoyi Lei
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

[Foreign Language] I have just one question. Could you please provide an update on the progress of our overseas localized production for next year? And additionally, how do we plan to leverage our smart driving capabilities to drive the sales growth in international markets?

Gui Hongdi
Honorary Vice Chairman of the Board & Co-President

It's Brian, again. Just to address your question on overseas plan for next year. You're right, we actually initiated our local production this half -- second half of this year with first factory in Indonesia and also the -- another factory production facility with partnership with Magna in Austria.

Those, I think, is slowly ramping up the capacity. So we anticipate the volume for next year's production in these 2 plants will continue to rise and support our overall sort of overseas growth. I think in the Europe, we are looking at the tens of thousands in terms of numbers of vehicle locally produced there. And in Indonesia, I think probably a smaller, but also a sizable number, high thousands is something that we want to achieve.

Looking beyond those 2 plants, we continue to look at additional opportunities to have local capabilities in other markets as well as building local supply chain capabilities to support the localization in these key regions. So we will be increasing our local content, increasing our local stores materials and also looking for further localization strategy to be implemented.

So that's something I think is ongoing. I think it's a must do for a company has global ambitions. Looking at the global product sales next year, I think, as Charles mentioned, we're looking for higher growth in the international markets compared to our domestic market. We're also looking for higher contribution economically from those markets. So I would say in the next year or the year beyond, we're looking at a faster growing, higher profit contribution for our international businesses.
