Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Erika Najarian from UBS.

L. Erika Penala
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

The first question is just a clarifying question on the expense trajectory, both the baseline and the Cadence addition and how we layer on the cost savings. So given that you gave the guidance on stand-alone, I'm guessing the baseline for core expenses would be $4.825-ish billion, which would exclude 2 months of Veritex, and then we layer on the stand-alone growth. I guess the other part of the question is that $1.1 billion is equal to 11 months of Cadence based on consensus '26. And so I'm wondering, particularly as I think about Brant's comments, if we then layer on the cost saves. And then I just have a follow-up.

Zachary Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Sure. I'm not sure exactly what your question was there, Erika, but I'll take it and sort of just unpack where the expense guidance is. Fundamentally, what we see at this point is underlying Huntington expense growth in the mid-single digits, aligned to generate 1.5 to 2 points of operating leverage. And then with Veritex bringing in the entirety of the Veritex cost base. And also, I would note the 2 small capital markets businesses that we added on January 1, those add about 1 point of total Huntington expense growth, obviously, more revenues as well, but that piece comes in.

And so the totality of all of that together is the 10% to 11% year-on-year growth, which generates really positive operating leverage, 150 basis points to 200 basis points, clearly on top of the 300 basis points of operating leverage we generated in 2025. And then Cadence is the $1.1 billion added on, as you noted, it's 11 months of expenses. It represents the full completion of the cost synergy program for both Veritex and Cadence by Q2 and Q4, respectively. And aligned to the previous guidance we've given about 75%, 3/4 of the Cadence cost synergies accruing in 2026.

I think what is also in there, clearly, I tried to highlight this in some of my prepared remarks, is continued investment back into the business. And we think that, that is a terrific model, not only to drive the kind of revenue performance we're achieving in '26, but even more importantly, over the longer term and continue to drive the competitive and share gains that we've got. So all of that is embedded in that, and we think it's the right model and the right posture at this point.

L. Erika Penala
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Got it. That's clear. So that addition includes both cost saves and investments back into the business.

And the second follow-up question I had, maybe this is more for Steve and Brant. I thought it was notable that when you talk about Veritex and Cadence, you say the word partnership very intentionally. Maybe talk about how your approach has been generating more goodwill in order to perhaps create revenue synergies and the cost synergies. And perhaps a better time line than other traditional acquisitions that are perhaps not treated as partnerships.

Stephen Steinour
Chairman, President & CEO

Erika, great question, and I'm going to let Brant answer this for the most part because he's been on point driving this, literally from the outset. But the format of the partnership has been incredibly beneficial to us. And we have great partners in both Malcolm Holland and Dan Rollins and their teams. And because we've been able to work together very tightly, and Brant will expand on this significantly, we are in a much better position with confidence on both the expense and the revenue synergy side.

So Brant, over to you.

Brantley Standridge
Senior EVP and President of Consumer & Regional Banking

Erika, thank you for the question. One of the things that partnership has allowed us to do is to really move with greater speed and rigor on some of the key decisions. And as it relates to Board decisions, management decisions, all of our colleague decisions, organizational structure decisions, all of those have been decided and communicated. That creates a high level of certainty for the colleagues of both Veritex and Cadence. It creates a lot of familiarity for them. And frankly, gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to deliver on the value creation given that we've created so much certainty for them so quickly.

The other component is, as you know, a large percentage of the cost synergies revolve around people. And so moving quickly to decide on or make all the key people decisions in the case of Cadence gives us a line of sight to the majority of our cost synergies there. So that partnership approach is -- clearly gives us some advantage or a lot of advantages when we think about both cost and revenue synergies.

Stephen Steinour
Chairman, President & CEO

And the teams have just been outstanding. The collaboration here, phenomenal. We are very impressed with the quality of the teams, and both these banks are well run. So these are not sort of fixer-up turnarounds. This is bringing our capabilities, products, et cetera, 2 terrific teams, which, as Zach pointed out, we will be further investing it to drive the revenue growth in the years ahead.

Operator

Our next question today is coming from Jon Arfstrom from RBC Capital Markets.

Jon Arfstrom
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Zach, I think you're going to get a workout this morning, but on expenses. But anything you can do to give us a little tighter range on expected first quarter expenses or early '26 expenses just to help set this up?

Zachary Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

I'll demur on giving you kind of quarterly guidance, Jon. I do appreciate it. Look, if I take a step back, for us, what's important is driving for positive operating leverage. And as we've noted sort of a number of times, even in the prepared remarks, highlighted this for 2025, we come into the year thinking somewhere between 100 and 200 basis points of operating leverage is a really good level. It supports the long-term earnings growth rate that we want to achieve. It also is the right balance for us as we execute that flywheel model, driving reengineering into baseline costs, reinvesting deeply back into the business to really power continued long-term revenue growth. And so I think that's the approach that we're taking, and we think it's the right one, as I noted before.

I will also highlight, if you look at that guidance slide, I mean just stare at that plus Cadence column, the marginal profitability that we're adding as we bring Cadence into the business is really significant. It's a 50% marginal efficiency ratio, and that's even before the full cost synergies. So all of this for us, adds up to an earnings growth trajectory that continues to meet our objectives and generate ultimately the long-term financial commitments that we've set, importantly, including that 18% to 19% return on capital.

Jon Arfstrom
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. All right. Just another question here just for clarification. On Slide 20, you talk about the revenue-producing initiatives that are embedded in the expense guide. How material are those? And then what revenue synergies, if any, from Veritex and Cadence is included in the guide?

Zachary Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Yes. Good question again. And the answer is very little of the revenue synergies are baked into the guidance at this point. This continues to be aligned to the longer-term objectives that we've set and we discussed at the Cadence partnership announcement call. I think as Brant highlighted in his prepared remarks, our expectation is to share a deep dive around where we expect the revenue synergies to be later this quarter in a further conference and then to layer that on and provide guidance around that. So a lot more to come there, and we're very excited about it.

If you think about the investments into the business, we've been growing investments back into the company at about a 20% clip for 5 years in a row, and our expectation is to continue to be the same. And the focus areas for those investments really continue to be digital technology development and capabilities across all areas of our business, marketing to acquire new customers. There's going to be a terrific opportunity to deploy digital acquisition across the new partnered, acquired footprints and then people to build out the businesses that we've been growing, and we'll continue to do that.

Operator

Next question is coming from Ken Usdin from Autonomous Research.

Kenneth Usdin
Bernstein Autonomous LLP

Zach, can you just -- back to Slide 20, do you have the starting point FY '25 baseline for core expenses that the 10%, 11% is built on?

Zachary Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Sure. It's $4.871 billion, Ken.

Kenneth Usdin
Bernstein Autonomous LLP

Yes. Exactly. Okay. Great. And then the second question is, I guess there's a little back and forth today about the cost base still being a little bit higher. But I wanted to just ask, if I look back at the October deck, when you talked about $2 of pro forma EPS in '27. I just want to make sure that there might be some timing differences in terms of how much you're reinvesting and how much things all come together. So are we still tracking towards that $2 of pro forma EPS that you guys had suggested back in October in the merger deck?

Zachary Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Yes. It's a terrific question, Ken. I love that question because it kind of comes back to ultimately the value creation model that we're trying to drive here is where our focus is. And the answer is yes. We continue to be on track for the fundamental drivers of that earnings power. If you think about it, the way I think about it is, first of all, 3 major drivers of value creation from the partnership, seamless integration and retention of talent and kind of continuing the momentum of the underlying businesses.

I will note that both Veritex in the period after close before conversion, was performing exceptionally well, driving above expectations, loan and deposit and revenue growth. And Cadence, likewise, we haven't even closed. We're expecting that just a week from now. They just reported their results this morning, and those likewise beat expectations continue to show very strong underlying growth. And so our partnership model would just enable that to continue.

Secondly, it's the cost synergies, and we have full line of sight to achieve or beat them. And then lastly, it's these revenue synergies, which are not in this guidance yet, but really will be powerful as we add those on and we continue to finalize the plans to go and achieve them. And so those are kind of the fundamental building blocks.

As I think about the EPS, look, we've generated 16% earnings per share growth in '25. The guidance I've given here on Page 20 applies somewhere in the kind of mid- to high teens for underlying organic EPS in '26. You should expect the same kind of growth in earnings power as we go into '27. And on top of that, you'll get the full run rate of the cost synergies, that's probably something on the order of a $0.10. And then revenue synergies. And of course, the PAA will be what it is ultimately, and we'll give guidance on that once it's finalized.

Our next question today is coming from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank.

Matthew O'Connor
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

You gave us the expense impact from the capital market deals. You said it added about 1% to the expense base. How about on the fee side? What's your rough estimate on the fee contribution from the capital market deals?

Zachary Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Yes, it's coming in sort of $80 million to $90 million of expense above revenues.

Matthew O'Connor
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And then I guess maybe talk about some of the other drivers of the fees because obviously, my model could have been wrong, but the fee guide seemed a lot better than I had even adjusting for that $80 million to $90 million. So maybe some details in terms of what are the key drivers of that growth.

Zachary Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Absolutely. Fundamentally, if you think about fees this year -- last year, in 2025, we generated 7% growth in core fees, and it was 8% in those 3 major fee driving categories. We talk a lot about payments, cap markets and wealth management. As we go into 2026, our expectation was to see acceleration of all of that -- all those categories, something on the order of 1% to 2% acceleration, and we've got a strong line of sight to delivering that. As we've noted, it's been a locus of a lot of investment over time. So we're seeing that come through now in terms of acceleration of revenue growth.

And then on top of that, you will add the $80 million to $90 million of revenues from the 2 new small capital markets divisions that are joining us plus Veritex. And so that's really the kind of the ingredients that get us to this guide and have strong line of sight and confidence to deliver.

Operator

Our next question today is coming from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America.

Unknown Analyst

This is Eric on for EB. Just maybe another one on the expense side. I was curious if you can talk about the level of investments that you guys have embedded into that underlying Huntington expense growth that you've mentioned at the mid-single digit. Anything new there? Any new investments or acceleration in spend that's kind of embedded?

Zachary Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Yes. Good question, Eric. Thanks for the follow-up. I'll highlight that we expect to grow investments at around 20% back into the business as we go into this upcoming year. And again, as I noted before, kind of the focus of that is always threefold, digital and technology capabilities across the business; secondly, marketing and last, people to build out the business. So I think about the kind of the initiatives that, that will power, we're still early days in a lot of the major new growth initiatives we've been talking about for the last couple of years, new commercial specialty verticals, both lending and deposit-oriented, new geographies that we've been growing into organically, North and South Carolina, Texas, all of those will be focused for continued investment.

We've talked about in the Carolinas, for example, the expectation in 2026 is to open a new branch there almost every 2 weeks. And so of course, that will be an area that we're investing in. And then I think Brant highlighted earlier, one of the biggest areas that we see opportunity to really capture revenue synergies from the combined franchise is in digital acquisition and customer acquisition across the footprint. And so there's funding in the investment plan to go after that.

Unknown Analyst

Got it. That's helpful. And then I think just a quick follow-up to clarify. I know you said you'll provide more details post the close, but I was curious what level of PAA is embedded into the NII guide?

Zachary Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Yes. It's somewhere between 7 and 10 basis points of NIM aligned to the prior expectations we had. Again, I think we've highlighted that in the Cadence earnings call or Cadence deal announcement call, and we'll update that as we get through the close here in the next month.

Next question is coming from Manan Gosalia from Morgan Stanley.

Manan Gosalia
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Zach, in your comments on the investment spend just now, you didn't mention AI. Is there any AI-related investment spend in there? And I guess the broader question there is, just given that there's a lot going on this year with the acquisitions, that's probably driving a lot of your investment spend. Would you say that 2026 is a high point for investment spend that you plan to make?

Zachary Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Thanks, Manan. Great questions, both. And to answer the second one first, the answer is no. The investments are not a high point here. In fact, investing into the business is the flywheel of value creation that we just talked about. We will always want to grow investments at a fast clip. And just think about the model, Manan, for a second, look back the last 6 years, revenue growth CAGR 10%, investment growth CAGR just about 20%, and earnings growth in the teens. And so that model is a sustainable long-term model, and we will keep driving it, and it's powered by not only earnings growth, but also disciplined reengineering of our cost base, something on the order of 1% per year. And so that's the model we expect to sustain in perpetuity, and that's what's driving our competitive success.

If you just move to AI, absolutely, there's significant investment happening in AI. I wouldn't characterize the nature of the driver of our investment growth as because of AI, but certainly, AI is growing along with those other investments as well. And we're seeing use cases across the organization really exponentially increase at this point, driving cost savings, driving productivity, driving a better customer experience in a lot of different ways. And, of course, more efficient technology engineering.

Stephen Steinour
Chairman, President & CEO

And Manan, what Zach referenced digital and technology, the AI was included in that.

Our next question is coming from Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research.

Derek Gonda
Wolfe Research, LLC

This is Derek on for Steven Chubak. Our first question we had was on the credit guidance. And it looks like the year-on-year increase, like our assumption is a lot of that is like kind of the seasoning of the loans you've put on the last year. But just curious if that's right. And just sort of what would cause you to fall on like one end of the guidance range versus the other?

Stephen Steinour
Chairman, President & CEO

Derek, you sound a little light. Could you repeat it? I think you referenced seasoning as the reason for the guide.

Derek Gonda
Wolfe Research, LLC

Yes. That's right.

Brantley Standridge
Senior EVP and President of Consumer & Regional Banking

If that was the case, let me just say that, yes, there's a little bit of that in there. But I mean, the reality is the performance this year was just exceptional. And as you look back over the history, we've been trending between that 25 to 35 basis points range for some time, and that's really the basis of our guide. And as Zach said in his implied remarks that we would be really in the lower end of that range. And so that's really the expectation for '26.

Derek Gonda
Wolfe Research, LLC

That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up question on the deposit beta. You mentioned the 40% beta in the last 2 weeks of the quarter. Just curious as we're thinking about 2 more rate cuts, if that's also the right level to be thinking about with incremental cuts on the way down.

Zachary Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Yes, yes. That's also a terrific question. It's an area of a lot of focus, as you know. And our expectation is to continue to get a solid down beta, something in the high 30s to 40% aligned with the guidance we've given. I'll tell you that beta in and of itself, it's not our objective function. Our objective function is core funding loan growth, really powering the ability to continue to drive peer-leading both loan growth and revenue growth with a great marginal return on capital, and that model is working exceptionally well. And we see -- it's, of course, a competitive environment, but the ability of the teams to execute on both volume growth and disciplined pricing continues to be very strong.

Operator

Our next question is coming from Chris McGratty from KBW.

Christopher McGratty
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Going back to the tech conversation for a second. This quarter, a lot of focus, tech wallet, growth rate, percent of revenues. Any -- I heard you on the one of the 3 things that you're really investing in, but do you have dollars around what you're putting in tech and the rate of growth?

Zachary Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Yes. Great question, Ken. We're smiling here because -- Chris, I'm sorry, because we're -- our expectation is in some of the conferences later this year -- later this quarter to really double-click into the investments to share with you more guidance on it. So I won't steal that thunder and give you a number today. But certainly, it's a powerful growth. And we've seen -- in our view, we're investing in technology in exactly the right places. It's all about customer-facing capabilities, driving both our value-added services, but also customer acquisition, digital marketing.

The question that we just got a second ago in terms of beta, the amount of MarTech capabilities that we've built over the last several years, is really what's enabling us to achieve these dual results of great deposit volume and pricing. And so those are the kind of things that we put our technology investments against. I'll come back to you with more details here in short order as we go to these conferences.

Christopher McGratty
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Understood. Yes, we'll wait for that one. And then on kind of the balance sheet, a lot of times you do acquisitions, companies have certain portfolios that maybe don't fit strategically. As you kind of evaluate both portfolio. Is there any tweaking that you presume might happen in the next couple of quarters as you get some other companies a little bit better?

Stephen Steinour
Chairman, President & CEO

Chris, as we looked at both partnerships and combined what that would do for the portfolios, we like it on the whole. And there's not, say, an exit portfolio. There's a little more commercial real estate construction than we would prefer, and we'll manage that in due course, nothing special with that. And -- but we've got some great growth areas that we're looking for that will offset anything we end up doing on the construction side.

Operator

Next question is coming from Brian Foran from Truist.

Brian Foran
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

I'm going to apologize in advance. I'm still on the struggle bus with the guidance. So on expenses, I guess the way I'm trying to think about it is, if I understand the math right, you plan on reporting something like $6.5 billion of expenses this year, maybe $6.46 billion to $6.5 billion, if I take the guide literally.

And then as I think about the exit from the year, pushing that up would be the 12th month of Cadence, pushing that down would be the cost saves, but then maybe pushing that back up is how much of the cost saves are reinvested over the course of the year? So is there any way to relate -- because people have really different takeaways. Some people are like, we're going to exit the year with $6.6 billion, and some people are like, we're going to exit the year at $6.2 billion. Is there any way to talk to an exit run rate of dollars of annualized expenses for the whole thing pro forma?

Zachary Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

I don't have that right in front of me, to be honest with you, Brian. My guidance to you would be to see -- look, I think we're going to, on a full year, see an efficiency ratio of around 55%, and we'll continue to see that improve as we go into '27. The growth rate of expenses relative to revenue should be very attractive as we get through Q4. And it all kind of goes back to that question we were talking before, are we on track for the earnings power in '27? And the answer is yes.

Brian Foran
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Maybe if I can try the same question on loan growth, tying myself in the same set of knots, we get to the back half of the year, everything is integrated. We're not talking about the year-over-year, we're talking about quarter-over-quarter annualized. So Veritex and Cadence running in there. I don't know if the Cadence number for loans is just where they are today or has some assumption in it.

But you kind of put this all together, would you expect to be still at 9% annualized loan growth exiting the year, where you are today before the acquisitions? Would you expect it to be slower as you do the integrations, faster as you recognize revenue synergies? Any kind of -- again, I understand the difficulty of doing a guide on what you're going to report when things are partial year impacts. But once we get through that, any way to talk to what you expect the core loan growth rate to look like in the back half of '26, again, linked quarter annualized, not year-over-year?

Zachary Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Yes, yes. Good question, for sure. Look, the way I think about it is our underlying loan momentum has been in the 8% to 9% range in 2025. As we thought about Huntington's stand-alone in 2026, our expectation was around the same amount. And in our long-range plan, when I say long-range plan, it typically means the next few years after that, 3 years, was of a similar growth rate. One of the strategic themes and rationales for us entering the partnership with Cadence and then also with Veritex was that they would expose Huntington to even faster organic growth opportunities over the course of time and great new opportunities to invest and build the business from there as well.

And so that 8% to 9% to me is a minimum. We would expect to see revenue synergies, growth synergies lift that, particularly in the near term. And of course, not giving '27 guidance this morning. But I think that kind of fundamental growth power is at or better as we get into the latter part of '26 and beyond.

Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America.

Ebrahim Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

Steve, just a big picture question beyond all the guidance-related questions. It feels like there's a lot going on at the bank in terms of banker hiring, a couple of deal integrations. As we look forward, just talk to us in terms of how you feel about just the integration of all this over the next 6 to 12 months? And I think there's an expectation that Huntington could still be on the lookout for additional deals. How should shareholders think about the potential for more M&A over the next maybe 6 months?

Stephen Steinour
Chairman, President & CEO

Ebrahim, thank you for the question. We sort of thought that one would come even a little earlier initially. But the -- let's start with -- we've got 2 partners, and they are performing exceptionally well with us. The teams are doing great work together. Brant, Dan Rollins, Malcolm Holland and their teams and our teams have come together in a very fundamentally sound and strong fashion, and we're off to a great start.

We've just completed -- we are completing the Veritex conversion as we speak, started over the weekend. We will close with Cadence in 2 weeks. As you heard from Brant, the org management and personnel decisions are made and communicated. We're moving very quickly with that. At the same time, the core of the company is performing well, and that's our primary focus, drive the core results.

So we're completing these integrations. They don't end at a conversion, but we're completing these conversions over the course of this year, maybe this year, a little bit more in terms of culture. But rapidly, so we can get at the revenue opportunities that we've talked about. Now we've used this term springboard on purpose. We think we have great growth potential in these markets. They're much better on average than the markets we've been operating it. And Texas is very unique, and we come together with a #5 share. So we've never been in these markets or markets like these before. So very optimistic. We're very focused on driving organic growth and executing these integrations extraordinarily well. And the partnerships are facilitating that, and we're aligned at creating shareholder value.

As to other M&A, maybe someday, we've been clear, I think it was the Goldman conference. We're not going to do an MOE. We're not going to go to auctions. They have to be strategic in nature where they're adding value and revenue growth for us, and they have to meet financial and risk metrics. And if someone approaches us with something of that nature, then we would take a look at it. But we're very focused on driving the organic growth of the business, and that's priority 1, 2 and 3 for us. We like the position we're coming into '26 with and the momentum we have, and we're ecstatic about the quality of the partners. These are 2 really good banks, great people coming into Huntington. I think we've got a terrific back half of the decade just with these combinations.

Ebrahim Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. And while I have you, maybe, Zach, just clarifying the 55% efficiency ratio you believe for full year '26...

Zachary Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Your voice cut out a little bit there, EB, at the end. I think you said, am I confident we'll hit 55% efficiency ratio. Is that right?

Ebrahim Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

Yes, 55% for '26. Yes.

Zachary Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Yes. Very, very confident.

We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments.

Stephen Steinour
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, thank you all for joining us today. We didn't mean to confuse you. And I hope we've sorted some of that out in the discussion. We're performing very well. We're coming off an extraordinary year. We've got a lot of momentum and very clear objectives as we move into '26. We've never been better positioned for the future, and we're excited about that. And our 20,000 colleagues and soon to be 25,000 are going to do everything we can to create shareholder value and build the franchise for years and years to come. We look forward to welcoming these 5,000 new colleagues coming to us from Cadence in the next couple of weeks.

Thanks for your interest. We'll be back to you mid-quarter for more details on the models and appreciate, again, your support. Have a great day.
