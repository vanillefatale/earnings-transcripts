Question-and-Answer Session

Andrew Marok
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Maybe one for Tal and one for Elad. Tal, if you could dive into some of the CTV strength drivers we saw in 3Q with the 75% growth. I know you had mentioned some spend shifts or budget shifts last quarter out of 2Q into the second half, but any more specificity there would be appreciated.

And then maybe on the guidance range, given that you're reiterating the guidance range, it does seem like a fairly wide range for 4Q. I guess what should we be inferring from that in terms of what you're seeing to date in either October or expectations for the holiday season?

Tal Jacobson
CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks for the question. So absolutely, on CTV, I think what we see is that our performance CTV, together with our new algorithm, Greenbids, which we now call Outmax, are really performing well. We're seeing healthy pipeline and deals from our customers, and that's what drove a significant growth that we're seeing.

Elad, do you want to answer the guidance?

Elad Tzubery
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Sure. In terms of the guidance, the quarter right now is trending in line with our expectations so far as we are entering to an important holiday season. We feel very good with our ability to deliver within this range of guidance. And we already increased the guidance at the beginning of the year in May, and it was important for us, of course, to make sure that we are delivering on everything that we are saying and maintaining the guidance as is, of course. But we do feel very confident in our ability to meet those numbers as we see. Overall, we do not see right now any slowdown, I would say, in spend of the advertiser. It's just a change of how -- in terms of time lines of how the budgets are getting or spending within the month.

Tal Jacobson
CEO & Director

Yes. So I'll just add to that, that as Elad said, we did raise our guidance within the year. And ever since then, we continued to build strong momentum. And as Elad said, the quarter is in line with our expectation, but we're waiting for the shopping season to see how that's enabled.

We'll take our next question from Eric Martinuzzi from Lake Street.

Eric Martinuzzi
Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division

Yes. I kind of wanted to revisit the Q4 growth. Just based on the projections here, that growth rate would be down versus the growth you had in Q3. I realized we're early in the holiday spending season. Is it just conservatism that, that sequential growth rate would be down?

Elad Tzubery
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, Eric. Thank you. I would say it's a bit conservative as well. As we mentioned, we are -- Q4 is obviously the peak of the year in terms of advertising budget and just before the holiday season, it was important for us to be cautious.

Eric Martinuzzi
Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then I know you haven't -- you're not addressing 2026. But right now, there is an expectation for double-digit growth there. I think the Street consensus is at 11% growth in 2026. Should that be coming down based on this -- what you're seeing for Q4?

Elad Tzubery
Chief Financial Officer

No, not at all. We haven't provided yet the outlook for 2026. We are providing it as usual at the end of the year. I can do -- what I can tell you, by the way, is that we are aiming for next year to capture much, much more market share than we are -- and we actually believe that we will be able to beat next year as well the Street expectation. And our growth engines will continue to outperform the market, and I believe that it will drive our growth going forward. And we are -- as much as we are focusing on the efficiency and we start to see this in terms of the numbers starting already for this Q, we are also investing in our current business to allow us to scale and to grow much faster also for next year.

Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.

Jason Helfstein
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

So, I guess kind of following on to what you just said, it sounds like you're having more success now selling the package of services across the different disciplines. There's been a pretty significant investment in sales and marketing to kind of get here. Just how are you thinking about the investment needed, particularly as we go into next year in sales and marketing? Is it still like another heavy lift? Or kind of can you harvest?

And then obviously, the implied kind of web business, I think, is down something like 11% year-over-year, give or take, our math in the quarter, but it's still roughly half of revenue. So obviously, CTV, digital out-of-home, some of the other areas are going to grow still meaningfully faster than that. Just how are you thinking about like those -- again, the puts and takes there, right, web declining, everything else or display really declining and everything else really growing as we're just thinking out over the next like 2 years?

Tal Jacobson
CEO & Director

Yes. Absolutely. Thanks for the question. So, I'll divide it into a few parts. One, we think that web and search is going to be totally aligned with human behavior. As AI agents or AI chatbots are growing, less and less web search is going to happen. And with this whole trend of 0 clicks on Google, I think less traffic is going to go on web. But that only means that a lot of the budgets are going to shift towards closed gardens, right, Meta, TikTok, Google, YouTube, out-of-home and CTV, which is exactly why we bought Greenbids. That's exactly why we bought Hivestack, and this is exactly why we're investing in those areas just because we think this trend is going to continue. But we do think our algorithm Outmax, our CTV and out-of-home is going to outpace the growth of the market going forward. So, that should show good growth in the next year and the year after that.

In terms of sales and marketing, before Elad is going to go a bit on the numbers, but sales and marketing is now so much easier since we have Perion One. We're seeing more and more an increasingly big number and it's increasing by the day of customers that are using more than one of our products. So, we do have algorithm with CTV customers. We have CTV with out-of-home customers. So, we're seeing synergies even faster than what we could have imagined at this time of stage within the transformation. It also helps us with marketing since we're spending marketing very focused on to drive new customers to the platform. We're seeing great success there.

Elad, do you want to add?

Elad Tzubery
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I would add about the sales, the S&M investment that we are planning to do also for next year to increase our ability to tap into more and more customers into the platform. So first and of course, foremost, we were going to increase, of course, our marketing budget as well as we are going to the market. We want to get a spread as possible when we are going into 2026. As Tal mentioned, '26 and '27 are years that we are aiming to scale Perion One as much as possible globally. As part of the changes also with the agreement, we are increasing also a bit the sales team just to get more and more reach points towards more customers and to be able to showcase the Perion One capabilities into more customers.

So definitely, this is an area that we're going to increase our investments next year. And also around, I would say, R&D as well. This is something that we are planning to increase also some of our resources around, investment around R&D in order to make sure that we are expediting our road map coming to the streets to our customers with more and more solutions and ability to spend more within this platform.

Our next question comes from Jeff Martin with ROTH.

Jeff Martin
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

Great. I was curious, you mentioned that there was a clouded comparison on web versus last year due to some low-margin business that was exited. Could you give us an apples-to-apples comparison and then pair that with how web trended relative to your expectation? I know the last 2 quarters, you've talked about a bottoming out of that a little earlier than expected. So, just curious how that trended in the quarter relative to your internal expectations?

Elad Tzubery
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So thanks for the question, Jeff. Actually, web acted exactly as we expected, I would say, even a bit better than our original plans. As I said, if you remember on February's call, we announced that we were closing some of our previous technology that related to web that they were very, very low margin, and they were defocused for Perion One strategy. And when we are comparing Q3 to Q3, major part of the decrease that you see in the web is because of this -- of those business lines we decided we are shutting down. Web, comparing to our expectations, actually did better if we are removing those terminated business.

Jeff Martin
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

Great. And just one more, if I could. You've talked in the past about expanding the TAM dramatically. Just curious if you could give us an update on timing of that and how it's trended so far this year?

Elad Tzubery
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, sure. So when we bought Greenbids, we got into YouTube and Meta, which is something that we never had the capability to do. So now every advertiser that spends money on YouTube, Google Ads and Meta can actually work with us and to trade us. Now, we're in process of integrating this into more social platforms and more and more DSPs. So, that will continue to increase our TAM. And you're going to see more and more growth out of that part, out of new channels. Hopefully, next year, you're going to see more channels than just web and CTV and out-of-home.

Our next question comes from Laura Martin with Needham.

Laura Martin
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

I need to ask the AI question. So, I'm merely interested in how you're using AI internally because it sounds like you're still hiring people and it's our thesis that if you're a tech company, you're using AI and not people. So, can you talk about internally how you're using new tools with AI to replace people?

And then secondly, I wanted to drill down a follow-up on some of my competitors' questions on web. I know, Tal, you think sort of that the open web is going to lose share, too, and that's why you've gone into digital out-of-home and CTV. But then Elad just said that a lot of the 11% decline in the quarter was attributable to actions you took in February, and therefore, the declines would have been much less, which implies to me, Tal, that by February, we anniversary those, let's call it, self-harm that you decided to do and that we could maybe return to growth in the open web, it sounds like. So, could you talk to me about how much of this web decline you think is structural because it sounds like it's a lot less than the 11% decline that you reported in the web business in the quarter?

Tal Jacobson
CEO & Director

Yes. All right. Thanks, Laura. So 2 things. So as you said, I think you're absolutely right. With time and automation, the amount of people we would hire is going to be lower. But as we build this company for scale, there are 2 parts where we do hire people. One, R&D, to continue to build AI-driven products because AI is everything, and we're becoming more and more of a technology company than anything else. And on the other part is sales, which sales should bring our new platform into more clients.

So, those are the areas where we look to hire more people. But everything else, we hired a new COO 6 months ago just for that to transform all our internal operation to be AI-driven and more efficient. So less and less manual work, more and more automation to AI. That's on the internal part. Now within -- when we built -- we're building Perion One. Also within that, everything is AI-driven. Even all -- everything that we built within R&D is now supported with AI. So, we can actually say that 100% of our R&D work is supported now with AI. So, that's on the AI part.

On the web part, I'll just say generally, and then I'll let Elad answer his part. But I'll just say, as far as human behavior, I do not think editorial websites are going to see a huge growth in the future, and that's where -- what we call web. Having said that, we did a few things within in-house like releasing SODA and other products for web. And since we're such a small part of web globally, even though it can grow within us, it doesn't necessarily mean that humans are going to use more and more editorial websites as a general trend. I don't think that's going to be the future.

Elad, anything you want to add to that?

Elad Tzubery
Chief Financial Officer

I can just add just to make sure that I was clear. The expectation that we had in shutting down those businesses that we will -- that the web will continue to decline more. Keep in mind, Laura, we are channel agnostic in a way. And that's right that our growth engines are digital out-of-home and CTV, of course, but it also allow us in a way to tap on the opportunity that's related also to web. I'm not expecting, by the way, going to the future that I will see increase in web that dramatically. But on a year-over-year comparison, as we will continue to increase the overall spend that will come through the system, I believe that also the web will capture some of those spend yet.

Was that answering your question?

Laura Martin
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Well, so I think a lot of what would help me is of the 11% decline, you said that most of it was this decision you've made in February. Was it 8% of the 11%? Like you would have only been down 3% in web if you hadn't taken the actions yourself in February. How much of the 11% decline was your actions in February?

Elad Tzubery
Chief Financial Officer

No. Actually, more closely towards 13% was related to our action. So overall, otherwise, I would say the web is increasing at roughly 2%.

Our last question comes from Jason Kreyer with Craig-Hallum Capital Group.

Jason Kreyer
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

Just one for me. So, you had highlighted how SODA and the out-of-home player create more predictable revenue streams. Wondering if you can just size up those opportunities and give a little more detail on how you monetize those solutions.

Tal Jacobson
CEO & Director

Thank you, Jason. And first of all, welcome. We're very happy to have you with us. So in terms of SODA and the digital out-of-home player, the thing is we're trying to be the operating system, the marketing operating system within the tech stack of the inventory part, right? So while Perion One is the operating system for marketers, SODA and the digital out-of-home player is the operating system for the inventory part. And we want to be as implemented as possible within their tech stack.

So, SODA for out-of-home and web publishers and obviously, the digital out-of-home player can get a bigger chunk of all the spend that's going through the screens. What it means is a lot of the time when digital out-of-home screen owners, the budget that we're seeing through them is the programmatic part. But when we implement the digital out-of-home player, we can actually benefit from all the budgets that are going through that. And that means direct and programmatic, that actually increases our TAM quite dramatically. And it does -- once that's going to be deployed in big scale, that will provide us better visibility and predictability into our revenue streams.

Does that answer your question?

Jason Kreyer
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

Yes.
