Presentation

Operator

Greetings. Welcome to the Prologis Fourth Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the conference over to Justin Meng, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you, Justin. You may begin.

Justin Meng
Senior VP & Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2025 earnings conference call. Joining us today are Dan Letter, CEO; Tim Arndt, CFO; and Chris Caton, Managing Director. I'd like to note that this call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding our outlook, expectations and future performance.

These statements are based on current assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these risks. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Additionally, during this call, we will discuss certain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP. And in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our fourth quarter earnings press release and supplemental. Both are available on our website at www.prologis.com.

And with that, I'll hand the call over to Dan.

Dan Letter
CEO & Director

Thanks, Justin. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. We delivered a strong fourth quarter and closed the year with solid financial and operational momentum, driven by disciplined execution and deep engagement with our customers across our markets. As we build on this momentum, I want to start by recognizing our teams around the world. Their dedication, creativity and customer focus are central to Prologis' success. In a few minutes, Tim will walk you through the details of our results. Before that, I'd like to share a few observations about the business. Across conversations with customers, investors, business partners and our teams, a consistent theme comes through.

Prologis' leadership goes well beyond scale. It's about how we operate, our commitment to excellence, the strength of our long-term relationships and our ability to anticipate what's next. That mindset defines our culture and continues to guide how we lead. Looking ahead, we're building on that foundation with a clear focus on 3 priorities. First, extending our leadership as a best-in-class operator, whether it's using data analytics to drive better decisions, deploying site-specific energy solutions or advancing venture initiatives that enhance our platform. Our objective is straightforward: to continue widening the moat that differentiates Prologis.

We do that through unmatched service, innovative solutions and the mission-critical reliability our customers depend on. Second, capturing the significant value creation opportunities ahead of us in both logistics real estate and data centers. Our track record in warehouse development is well established, and we're positioned to deliver the next generation of modern strategically located facilities. At the same time, advantage today is defined by location, power and scale.

With a growing power pipeline, deep customer relationships and multidisciplinary expertise, we are well equipped to develop critical infrastructure few can match. We will approach data centers with the same discipline and long-term perspective that has defined our success over time. And third, enhancing shareholder returns through continued growth in assets under management.

Our private capital partners are increasingly seeking fewer managers who can deliver consistent performance across geographies and strategies, and we are perfectly suited to serve as that partner of choice. We are developing new vehicles and strategies that build on our track record of performance, transparency and partnership, and we're making strong progress. As we enter 2026, we do so from a position of strength and with the strategic initiatives in place to extend our leadership and compound value for our shareholders.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Tim to walk you through our results and outlook.

Timothy Arndt
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Dan. As mentioned, we are very pleased with our results and closed the year with strong momentum. Our teams performed exceptionally well, signing 57 million square feet of leases in the quarter and driving occupancy toward 96%, further widening our outperformance versus the market. Improved customer sentiment, together with better-than-expected market conditions, reinforces our view that vacancy has peaked and rents are beginning to inflect across many markets.

Momentum extended across the growth areas of our business as well. Our development platform, particularly in build-to-suits, continues to outperform, exceeding expectations and capturing meaningful market share. In strategic capital, we formed 2 new investment vehicles in the U.S. and China. In our Data Center business, the power pipeline continues to grow, and we expect a solid year of starts. Turning to our results. Fourth quarter core FFO was $1.44 per share, including net promote expense and $1.46 per share, excluding net promote expense, finishing the year at the top end of both our most recent and inaugural guidance ranges.

On an owned and managed basis, average occupancy was 95.3% for the quarter and 95% for the full year, with period end finishing the year at 95.8%. Results were driven by strong new leasing and healthy retention of 78%. And in the U.S., we expanded our outperformance versus the broader market to 300 basis points, reflecting the quality of both our portfolio and operating platform.

Net effective rent change was 44% for the quarter, contributing approximately $60 million of annualized NOI and driving net effective rent change for the year to more than 50%. Our net effective lease mark-to-market ended at 18%, representing nearly $800 million of embedded NOI yet to be realized without any increase in market rents. The rate of decline in our lease mark-to-market has slowed considerably and many markets, including several in the U.S. and most across LatAm and Europe are once again seeing expansion as market rent growth begins to outpace portfolio churn.

Finally, same-store NOI growth was 4.7% on a net effective basis and 5.7% on a cash basis, each ahead of the midpoint of guidance. And for the full year, net effective same-store growth was 4.8%, hitting the top end of our range. Turning to capital deployment. It was another active quarter. We sold approximately $900 million of value-maximized assets and acquired $625 million at attractive discounts to replacement cost, generating between them a positive 150 basis point spread in expected IRR.

On the development front, we started $1.1 billion in new buildings in the quarter, which were all logistics projects and over 48% build-to-suit. For the year, we started $3.1 billion where build-to-suits represented an impressive 61%. It's worth reemphasizing that this success is driven by a deliberate and differentiated strategy, matching well-located entitled land with a strong customer franchise, allowing us to generate attractive returns despite the derisked nature of the projects.

In our Energy business, we delivered another strong quarter lifting total installed capacity to 1.1 gigawatts, achieving and surpassing our 1-gigawatt goal set 4 years ago. We will build on this progress, adding additional capacity given the significant untapped potential across the portfolio. Before turning to market conditions, I'd like to highlight that Prologis recently led the creation of an industry snapshot developed in partnership with JLL, Cushman & Wakefield and Colliers.

This collaborative effort combines our proprietary research with timely and transparent brokerage data across 34 U.S. markets. You can find the report in the Research section of our website. Overall, we are progressing through the 3 stages of inflection we outlined last quarter, evidence of enduring demand, resulting build in occupancy, followed by an inflection in rents. We are now seeing all 3 at varying stages and paces across our geographies, setting up a constructive 2026.

Fourth quarter net absorption was 59 million square feet in the U.S., a strong finish to the year and further evidence that demand is both visible and building. Higher absorption levels, which exceeded completions for the first time since 2022, resulted in a decline in U.S. vacancy to 7.4%. The result is that market rents declined at their slowest rate since 2023 with many markets posting positive growth.

Across our portfolio, demand remained the strongest in large space formats, but it's encouraging that occupancy increased across all of our size categories. The tone of our conversations with customers is increasingly forward-looking. While uncertainty is always top of mind, including tariff policy, it is now treated more as a planning assumption rather than an impediment. E-commerce remains a meaningful driver of this demand, representing approximately 20% of our new leasing activity over the last year, making 2025 its best year since 2021.

Large retailers with significant e-commerce operations continue to expand and diversify their networks to shorten delivery times and improve efficiency. Their ongoing innovation and growth, combined with a threefold multiplier in the space required for e-commerce continues to provide a powerful tailwind for our business.

Finally, outside of the U.S., our international markets continue to outperform. In Latin America, consumption trends in both Mexico and Brazil remain robust, supporting high occupancy and ongoing rent growth. Europe delivered another solid quarter, maintaining strong occupancy and posting its first quarter of positive rental growth in 2 years.

Japan also performed exceptionally well with occupancy above 97% and outperformance relative to the market of nearly 600 basis points. Together, these results highlight that our global footprint is not only strategic and valued by our customers, but also a key driver of the diversity and resilience of our platform.

Turning to capital raising. We achieved 2 important milestones in strategic capital. First, the IPO of the ChinaAMC Prologis Logistics REIT, as we call it the CREIT on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, marking our third publicly listed vehicle. Similar to NPR in Japan and FIBRA Prologis in Mexico, the CREIT broadens our access to capital, diversifies our investor base and strengthens our presence in one of the world's most dynamic logistics market.

Second, we added a new vehicle focused on development, redevelopment and value-add opportunities, a strategic complement to our open-ended funds focused on stabilized investments. In the fourth quarter, we held the anchor closing for the U.S. Agility Fund, yet another endorsement of the Prologis platform in a competitive capital-raising environment.

We have a deep pipeline of capital-raising strategies in various stages of formation for this foundational business line. We look forward to sharing additional updates with you as the year progresses. Moving on to data centers. At its core, this business is centered on 4 priorities: procuring power, securing build-to-suit lease transactions, delivering world-class facilities for our customers and harvesting value through asset sales. We continue to make clear progress on each front.

During the quarter, we expanded our power access to 5.7 gigawatts, stabilized 72 megawatts of projects and sold a state-of-the-art turnkey facility at compelling economics. In terms of leasing, demand is exceptional and every megawatt in our pipeline is in some stage of discussion, including 1.2 gigawatts currently in LOI or pending lease execution.

Our data center team and capabilities are expanding and executing at a very high level, and we're extremely excited by the significant value creation opportunity ahead. Turning to guidance, which I'll review at our share. We are forecasting average occupancy to range between 94.75% and 95.75%, which includes the expectation for a seasonal drop in occupancy in the first quarter before rebuilding over the year.

Net effective same-store growth is forecasted to be in a range of 4.25% to 5.25% and cash in the range of 5.75% to 6.75% with rent change being the predominant and enduring component of this growth. Our G&A forecast is for $500 million to $520 million, and our strategic capital revenue forecast calls for $650 million to $670 million.

As for deployment, we are forecasting development starts to range between $4 billion and $5 billion on an owned and managed basis. As mentioned earlier, we have increased visibility and confidence around new starts in our Data Center business. So we have included those volumes in this guidance at approximately 40% of the activity. Acquisitions will range between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, and our combined contribution and disposition activity will range between $3.25 billion and $4.25 billion.

In total, we are establishing our initial GAAP earnings guidance in a range of $3.70 to $4 per share. Core FFO, including net promote expense will range between $6 and $6.20 per share, while core FFO, excluding net promote expense will range between $6.05 and $6.25 per share. In closing, 2025 brought unexpected challenges and periods of uncertainty, and we're very pleased with how the company performed throughout the year.

Our teams once again demonstrated the strength and resilience of our platform and the discipline of our world-class operations, delivering strong operational and financial results. Equally important, we used the year to strengthen the foundation of our business by advancing development entitlements, expanding strategic capital and accelerating our progress in data centers and energy.

As a result, we enter 2026 from a position of strength with operating momentum and a setup that supports durable long-term growth. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Operator?
