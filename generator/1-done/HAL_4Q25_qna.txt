[Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of Saurabh Pant from Bank of America.

Saurabh Pant
BofA Securities, Research Division

Jeff, maybe I want to start with the topic, which everybody has been bombarding us for the past 2 weeks, which is Venezuela, if you don't mind. I noted, Jeff, you said in your prepared remarks, right, that -- I know it's early days, right? But you talked about early steps are well underway, right? So my question is, maybe just help us think about how quickly can Halliburton, your customers move into the country? What do you need to see to start doing that?

And then secondly, ultimately, I know this is not certain, right? But what is the potential size of the opportunity? And how quickly can you scale up in Venezuela?

Jeffrey Miller
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Yes, Saurabh. Look, I think we could scale up fairly quickly. We're working through the mechanics around licenses and things that we're certain will get in place. But as far as returning to the country, we move equipment around all over the world. So we can move equipment quite quickly. We still have a footprint there in Venezuela in terms of operating bases and whatnot. And so getting equipment there to work, fairly straightforward. There are operators in Venezuela today. And so I think there are opportunities for us sooner rather than later to get back to work. And so we're assessing what we would do and where we would start. I have -- my phone is ringing off the hook in terms of interest in Halliburton being there. And so confident that we can move fairly quickly in Venezuela and excited about that.

As far as the size of the market, small market today relative to what it was a decade ago. A decade ago, it was probably a $0.5 billion business for us pretty consistently. Now as time dragged on, that market started to shrink and it got smaller. But I -- quite optimistic about longer term being a much bigger business. And I think in the near term, getting back to work and contributing to our business at Halliburton.

Saurabh Pant
BofA Securities, Research Division

Right. No, that's a good update, Jeff. I think we need to keep -- we need to stay in tune on what's going on, but that sounds like a good opportunity.

Just a very different pivot going back to 2026, Jeff, I know you gave some color on your expectations for activity, for revenue, which frankly, is in line to a little better than I think several people were thinking. So that's a good place to start. But on the margin side of things, Jeff, as we think about the pluses and minuses, pricing is part of it and not just NAM, but international pricing, operating leverage, cost is part of it. And then Eric, maybe a little color on SAP spending trajectory.

If we put all of that together, what does the margin side of the story look like for '26? Any preliminary thoughts on that?

Jeffrey Miller
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Well, look, I think the second half looks stronger than the first half, most certainly. When we look around the world, it's pretty steady around the world. Obviously, larger tenders are going to be more competitive and we see some of those. But by and large, it's a stable market internationally. And so I see, again, progress as we get certainly into the second half of the year around margins.

Eric Carre
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Saurabh, and as it relates -- go ahead, Saurabh -- no, no, I was going to jump to your SAP question, but if you have a follow-up for Jeff, go ahead.

Saurabh Pant
BofA Securities, Research Division

No, SAP, let's cover SAP first, Eric.

Eric Carre
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. Yes. So SAP, we guided $45 million for Q1, and that's pretty much the run rate that you should be thinking about throughout 2026. So $40 million to $45 million. We anticipate the project to complete in Q4 of this year, which is a little later than we had earlier guided. We've adjusted the plan slightly as we learn progressing through the rollout of the system. We've also broadened the scope of the project to include some of the adjacent processes such as outsourcing our payroll and redesigning our overall OTC process.

So in summary, about $45 million -- $40 million, $45 million a quarter until the end of the year and project completed in Q4 with expected savings of about $100 million a year after the project is completed.

Jeffrey Miller
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Saurabh, if I may go back to your first question a little bit here as well. So if I look at all of 2026, as I said, I think second half is better than the first half. But again, North America is taking a conservative posture. I think we've got some bright spots internationally.

But I think the more important point is what's happening in terms of the rebalancing of the market. And that's really this pragmatic view of the world as opposed to idealistic, barrels are being absorbed, decline rates are higher now than they were in terms of -- because unconventionals are a larger part of the supply stack. And quite frankly, exploration success has been anemic. And while all that's happening, demand is growing. So I think we're setting up for a rebalancing year in '26 of supply and demand to be followed by very sustained strength.

Saurabh Pant
BofA Securities, Research Division

Right. No, that makes a ton of sense, Jeff. Like you said, rebalancing year and really the focus should be on '27, '28, right? And hopefully, things go in the right direction.

Our next question or comment comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.

Neil Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

A quick question here first on the international breakout. You said up slightly '26 versus '25. Can you just go -- give us a tour around the world, Jeff, and give us perspective by market? Where do you see increments and decrements?

Jeffrey Miller
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Yes. Look, our outlook at this point is flattish to maybe up a little modestly. Look, I think Latin America leads the way in terms of growth. Brazil, deepwater is powering ahead. Argentina, we see quite a bit of growth, and that's obviously right in our wheelhouse. Ecuador, Guyana. Obviously, Guyana has been a strong business for us and will continue to be. And so overall, Latin America, very much a bright spot.

Middle East, I think it's flattish, flattish, maybe even down slightly. And I say that just because I'm well aware of the activity growth in Saudi Arabia, but taking a bit more conservative view of the timing and pacing of that coming back. It likely will, but it's less clear to me sort of how impactful and how early that would be. But overall, the rest of the Middle East is solid business, pleased with that business.

And then Asia Pacific really looks fairly flattish to us. A lot of gas demand in Asia. So positive things happening, but overall, flattish for '26 anyway.

Neil Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Yes, that's a helpful break. And Jeff, maybe take a moment to talk about VoltaGrid. I think we've gotten more comfortable as an investment community around that business and the potential, and you've announced an important joint venture in the Middle East. From where you sit, how important is this business for you guys? How big can it be? Do you see yourselves as a logical consolidator over time? Do you like the minority position? Just your perspective, anything you're willing to share about it.

Jeffrey Miller
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Yes. Look, I'd say I'm really excited about where we are in the outlook for that business and the international piece of that business. I won't comment on the U.S. I think that's well understood and the pace of growth there and our role and ownership in VoltaGrid. As we look around the world, a lot of interest from customers around the combination of VoltaGrid technology and Halliburton's proven execution and footprint and capability.

And so solid pipeline, like the volume. And so I think that this could be a very big business over time. I mean it's like all businesses we're starting. We're fairly -- very familiar with the business. It's going to grow at the pace that it will, but we've already committed to 400 megawatts. I think 400 megawatts is a good start as we place those. And what we've seen historically is that we place a few hundred megawatts and then that tends to grow over time as data centers expand. And there's -- just no question that there's not enough electricity power generation in the world today, in the U.S. or anywhere else. So very confident in this, and I think it could be a very big business over time.

Next question or comment comes from the line of David Anderson from Barclays.

John Anderson
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

You've talked about rebalancing of the market. I was wondering if you could talk more specifically about North American stimulation market and how that's rebalancing. You talked about the attrition going on, but I'm wondering how pricing is holding up here and whether or not you see this firming up throughout the year because you're also seeing equipment moving out to Middle East. I know you talked about you're bringing some equipment down to Vaca Muerta. So how is that component kind of factoring into pricing? Do you expect pricing to kind of hold up here? And is this sort of a part of the rebalancing story?

Jeffrey Miller
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Yes. Look, I think frac pricing is fairly stable at this point. We did -- Q4 is fairly stable. And as we go into Q1, our frac business stays very stable as well going into Q1. Now from a pricing standpoint, broadly, I think that given where pricing is and performance of companies in that market, we are fortunate that we outperformed the market by quite a bit. But pricing reaches a point where it's not -- companies aren't investing in it. We are moving equipment away from it.

And so I think it's certainly stable at that level. And yes, I think there's incentives to move equipment outside the U.S., which we're doing in some cases. And so I think we're at a bottom, and I would expect that, that improves over time, but I'm not going to give you a date when it improves. But I think the bias is towards there's not investment in the market in terms of more equipment and equipment is wearing out, which we know. And equipment, in some cases, is moving outside the U.S. and some equipment, ours in some cases is being stacked. So I think all of those are positive and rational behavior in a market where we require returns.

John Anderson
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

That makes a lot of sense. Of course, you do on that side. I was wondering if you could talk -- Eric, maybe you could talk a little bit more about the C&P margin progression throughout the year. The guide for first quarter is more or less in line with what we were looking for. But how should we think about kind of where the rest of the year shakes out on the margin side? And perhaps you could also just talk a little bit how Multi-Chem, the sale of Multi-Chem impacts that and maybe the decision to sell Multi-Chem? And does that provide an uplift for margins throughout the year?

Eric Carre
Executive VP & CFO

So the -- let me start with the Multi-Chem. So we think the sale should be completed this quarter. The impact on the margin will be positive, but frankly, it will not be material overall. Talking about the progression of C&P margin, we think the margin progress throughout the year. But let me give you some color as well to the guide of margins from Q4 to Q1 because while it is not out of line with the differential in margin that we've seen in prior year, the actual makeup is a bit different.

So if you look at the Q1, so we guided about 300 basis points down for C&P margin. So that is actually coming from 3 buckets. The first bucket, which is over half of the drop is related to the roll-off of completion tool sales. That part is not unusual. What is a bit unusual is the amount of completion tool sales we had in Q4. If you look at the progression Q3 to Q4, our completion tool revenue increase was 3x what we saw in the prior 2 years. So that talks a lot to the strength of our completion business. But that's about over half of the drop, then you get about 25% of the drop that's related to the typical seasonality in the international business for C&P as our C&P business is increasingly -- has an increasingly large footprint in the international markets, and that's about 3% to 6% reduction in revenue. So that's kind of typical with historical decreases. And the rest is really a product geographic mix issue, which is really not structural as it relates to C&P.

And then there is a bit of a kind of an optical view on Q4 to Q1, which is we typically have a lot of tailwind with the U.S. frac business, which goes through seasonal factor, I mean, seasonality in Q4 and benefits from an uplift going into Q1. We don't have any of that this year as our Q1 frac business in the U.S. looks to be just straight flat to Q4. So again, a little bit of color as the makeup of the delta is a bit different from prior years.

Our next question or comment comes from the line of Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan.

Arun Jayaram
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. Jeff and Eric, I appreciate the outlook comments on 2026. I was wondering if we could maybe think about what your outlook comments around international and North America could mean for overall margins. You gave us some good color on where you expect revenues to kind of shake out. But just trying to narrow thoughts around -- the Street today sitting at just under $4 billion of EBITDA for '26. I'm just trying -- want to get just general comfort level of where the Street sits today based on your outlook comments.

Jeffrey Miller
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Yes. Go ahead, Eric.

Eric Carre
Executive VP & CFO

No. If you look at just kind of margins overall, as Jeff professes, we think H2 is better than H1. So you're going to see some slight progression through the year. And while we typically don't comment on Street estimates or provide guidance at this stage on margins, the $4 billion that you quoted is really within the range of outcomes that we are looking at.

Arun Jayaram
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. That's helpful, Eric. And just my follow-up, Jeff, in your prepared comments, you talked about ZEUS IQ and some of the things that Halliburton is doing to help North American operators boost well productivity. I also wanted to talk to you a little bit about some of the updates we've gotten from the majors where they're talking about using lightweight proppant and surfactants. And I was wondering if you could discuss some of these efforts and maybe how you're helping clients maybe to use some of these emerging technologies? And could these be needle movers for HAL?

Jeffrey Miller
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Look, my comments are around our technology and the technology that we produce, and very pleased with what we are doing. And I think that the ability to place proppant and do things with proppant effectively is one of the really unique features of ZEUS IQ. And I think that's under all conditions a very valuable solution, and as I said, a building block to how recovery has improved because quite frankly, where the sand goes has been an unknown in this business since it started in 1947. And really just in the last year or 2 have we been able to directly measure sand placement and also control where sand goes. And this is primarily because of the ZEUS setup and its ability to handle the pressure and the things required in order to respond to the [ reservoir ].

Our next question or comment comes from the line of James West from Melius Research.

James West
Melius Research LLC

So Jeff, clearly, international outlook, second half better than first half, we get that. Venezuela, a little bit of a wildcard. But curious where you think there could be pockets of strength that emerge, knowing that neither you or I, as long as we've been doing this, have a crystal ball and the cycle is always going to play out a little bit differently. But we've got a lot of things in the works here that could influence the oil price, and so could cause some markets to either inflect higher or lower. But where do you think maybe the surprises could come from if you think about a higher oil price environment in the second half and leading into, of course, as you described, a solid upturn in '27, '28?

Jeffrey Miller
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Well, look, I think Argentina is one that's going to respond. It's already responding. But I think when I think about that market, the pace of interest in international investors in that market is high. I mean, that's become a very solid market that's going to become more and more responsive to commodity price in a positive way. Kudos to the operators in that market today who have taken on the challenge of building infrastructure and evacuating the hydrocarbons from the market. I mean, these are all of the things that a very dynamic market can do and will do, and that's what we're seeing being done in Venezuela -- excuse me, in Argentina. I think the Caribbean is another place we're really excited about possibilities and what could happen sort of throughout the Caribbean as we look at next year.

I think that West Africa is another where we're seeing sort of renewed interest and better -- it seems like better terms for operators and better terms for us where we're able to execute sort of all of our services in these markets. So I'm pleased with that. I think that's a bright spot. And then ultimately, Algeria, I think over time, in '26 could become a brighter spot than we would expect. So I'm thinking about upside surprise, I think those are some of the places where we could see those.

James West
Melius Research LLC

Okay. That's very helpful, Jeff. And then just a follow-up for me on the power markets broadly, VoltaGrid is obviously with your investment there and taking them into the Middle East and leveraging your platform is critical for you. How are you thinking about other potential investments in power? Is VoltaGrid kind of your main objective here? Or are you talking with others? I mean, how do you think about just the build-out of the electrification theme and the data center theme and the power theme as it relates to Halliburton?

Jeffrey Miller
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Well, thanks. It's one of the things that we take a step at a time is the bottom line. I mean, we're certainly aligned with VoltaGrid in the U.S. We're knowledgeable and have built out a team around power that's looking at our international business, both in the Middle East and beyond the Middle East, most certainly.

And so I think what we'll do, like we do in all things around here, is we take them a step at a time. We build businesses. We don't get ahead of our skis, and we look for the things that we think will be contributing to that. And so the outlook is really good in this area. We know a lot about it and would expect that we continue to grow that business as we get deals done.

Our next question or comment comes from the line of Stephen Gengaro from Stifel.

Stephen Gengaro
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

So curious, Jeff, what do you think about -- like the fourth quarter was stronger than we had thought, and there was less downtime, white space, et cetera. We've heard that from many going into earnings. Why do you think that was? Like does that tell you anything about the way E&Ps are thinking about it? Or is it just weather related? Is there any drivers behind that and what it might mean going forward?

Jeffrey Miller
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Look, I think weather was a factor. I think a number of things conspired to make Q4 more solid than we expected. I think the operators that we work for stayed busy. I mean, we've got a solid group of customers that take a long view of unconventionals and technology for that matter. And so for that reason, stayed busier certainly for us. And I think that that's probably how this market may look more this way over time, although I expect there probably will be solid inflection if commodity price gives it some help.

Stephen Gengaro
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

And then the follow-up is just around sort of your expectations for sort of completion efficiency and sort of the impact on U.S. production, just as we're sort of thinking about kind of frac demand relative to some of the other high-tech services you provide and how that kind of impacts U.S. production and if you think we have enough activity right now to sustain production.

Jeffrey Miller
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Yes. Outlook is we're probably at maintenance sort of levels today if not below those is my view. And I think that technology driving better recovery is really the key as we look ahead. I mean to go faster, we are going faster, but we're pumping -- continuous pumping at rates that you really just can't pump any faster. And so I think the real hurdle is going to be how to better produce a fantastic resource. And I know that technology is at the core of that, same as it has been everywhere.

And so look, I think our frac fleets get bigger than they were in the past. And so I think it takes more horsepower to do more work. It takes more technology to keep the equipment both working, continuous pumping requires technology as does certainly the ability to place sand.

That said, our drilling services business is continuing to strengthen into what has been a slowing market, at least from a rig count standpoint. And I think that's a reflection again of technology, what we do with LOGIX, which is our automation platform for drilling, what the tools themselves are able to do. We see similar -- I mean, the uptake on that has been fantastic. And I think that's all driven by the real drilling requirements to drill longer wells, more complex wells. And so look, I'm just pleased with the growth of technology for both of our divisions today.

Our next question or comment comes from the line of Scott Gruber from Citigroup.

Scott Gruber
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

So I want to come back to power as the growth prospects are certainly exciting, and excited to hear that they're bubbling to the surface internationally. How do the prospective returns on these power projects compare to your organic investments? You also have pockets of growth, obviously, within your core and maybe that expands with Venezuela. So just curious how the power project returns kind of compare? Are they higher, lower, broadly in line? And more importantly, kind of how does that shape the vigor with which you could deploy capital into the power opportunity set?

Eric Carre
Executive VP & CFO

It's Eric here. So I think it will depend on the opportunities, the country, what type of other potential power sources we would be competing with. So it's really early to tell you that it's accretive, dilutive to our current return. It will depend. But overall, these are typically very long-term contracts where you enter in it with a fairly low risk, long-term very good view of what you have to deliver. And if we look at the comparison of what's been happening in North America, then you could say the returns are probably higher than what we have today.

Scott Gruber
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then, Eric, maybe if you could walk through some of the items that will impact cash conversion this year. Thinking about working capital, do you anticipate continued catch-up payments from your customer in Mexico? Anything to note on cash taxes? And any comment on SAP spending for the full course of the year would be appreciated.

Eric Carre
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean, look, there's a lot of moving parts in what you're describing. It's a bit early to comment on working capital impact, collections, et cetera. I mean, collections have been great throughout the year. It was a bit challenging as we talked on several calls, collecting from Mexico, the situation seems to be going a lot better.

So look, we'll give more details, and we'll update our thoughts overall on all the kind of ins and outs that touches the projection around free cash flow.

Our next question or comment comes from the line of Derek Podhaizer from Piper Sandler.

Derek Podhaizer
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Just wanted to go back to the attrition discussion in U.S. land. Obviously, a lot of moving pieces here between equipment high-grading, idling, stacking legacy diesel fleets, redeploying some of those fleets to international unconventional markets. But just when you look at your fleet and maybe canvas the market, is everything deployed that could be? Or are there a few fleets that could be thrown together? Just trying to think through the tangible attrition and your comment around the small increase in demand could tighten this market quickly. What does that look like for you and the market? And what could it mean for C&P specifically this year?

Jeffrey Miller
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Well, we have consciously stacked fleets. We stacked fleets in Q3, and we stacked some more fleets in Q4, all of which could go back to work for returns that are acceptable to us, and some of those may go internationally. But from our standpoint, our fleet is in really good shape. And there are things that could go to work that aren't working. And they will go to work when we see the appropriate level of pricing for those.

But when I look at the whole market in terms of attrition, I'll just use an observation in terms of fleet size. We've got, let's say, 65,000 horsepower out for a simul-frac. We see a number of fleets in the market running 120,000 horsepower to do similar work that tells me that equipment is being repaired and put together in an effort to keep it working, which tells me that expanding or taking those apart would be really a challenge. And so the market is moving more towards bigger fracs that require more equipment. And I think the ability to add fleets is just really not there. And so it doesn't take much, in my view, to create tightness just because the performance requirements are high, the technology requirements are increasing and all of those things create quite a bit of tightness.

Derek Podhaizer
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. Moving over to the Middle East. I know in your comments, you talked about a flattish outlook, even slightly down. Can you just maybe walk through some of the regions for us and what you're seeing specifically Saudi, UAE, Kuwait, Oman, Iraq and anything else you'd like to highlight?

Jeffrey Miller
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Look, actually fairly stable in most of those markets. There's always shifting from completion to drilling and drilling to completion in some markets. I'd say UAE is strong. Kuwait is very strong for us. And I think Iraq is a good story in terms of activity that we see coming up. And so look, I think as I look across the entirety of the Middle East, fairly stable. See, again, rigs being added in Saudi Arabia, very positive, but taking a bit of a more cautious view around the timing of that.

Operator

Our next question or comment comes from the line of Marc Bianchi from TD Cowen.

Marc Bianchi
TD Cowen, Research Division

Jeff, I was hoping you could comment on the offshore market outlook in a little bit more detail. I think everybody is sort of anticipating some sort of uptick in the second half of '26, but there have been prior calls for upticks that didn't materialize. So just kind of curious what your view is on that.

Jeffrey Miller
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Look, I'll leave a lot of that to the rig contractors in terms of rig placements, et cetera. But we've won a lot of offshore work. It's very strong for us, continues to be a significant part of our international business. And I'd say the bias towards integration and our value proposition in offshore is important, and it's one of the reasons that we're winning work in offshore. It's really strong in Norway, Latin America, West Africa. All of those will be busy for us.

And I think the other indicator is our completion tool order book is at an all-time high, which tends to be, again, biased towards deepwater and offshore work. So from our perspective, that's a strong business for us and expect it -- where we are for it to stay strong in 2026.

Marc Bianchi
TD Cowen, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then the other question I had was on Venezuela, going back to that. So you had mentioned that you're looking to grow the business as soon as commercial and legal terms are resolved and including payment certainty. Can you maybe level set for us what that time line might look like? And is this going to be led by the IOCs and then Halliburton will follow? Or do you anticipate Halliburton moving in either coincident or perhaps before some of these IOCs make up their mind?

Jeffrey Miller
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Well, I think there's paths to both of those. And as we work through what payment certainty looks like and how we solve for that, obviously, IOCs are an important part of that, but we -- also there are companies operating there today that we can work for under the right conditions and circumstances.

And so from a timing perspective, as we solve those, which I don't -- I think there's a lot of will to solve for these things. And so I -- this is -- we can mobilize in weeks. I think it's in months that we -- but again, we work through those things, but I feel confident we can move fairly quickly as opportunities arise. And again, talking with lots of customers, some operating, some wanting to operate, and this will all be a continuum of getting back to work in Venezuela.

Operator

Thank you. I'm afraid that's all the time we have for questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Miller for any closing remarks.

Jeffrey Miller
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Yes. Thank you, Howard. Before we wrap up today's call, let me close with this. I'm excited about Halliburton's opportunities now and in the years ahead. Our differentiated technology delivers exceptional value for our customers and for Halliburton and the ongoing shift towards collaborative work means Halliburton is squarely where the market is headed. Look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
