[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Peter Grom with UBS.

Peter Grom
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Happy New Year. So Geoff, I appreciate the commentary on the path forward. But can you maybe just elaborate on the confidence in the back half inflection that's embedded in the guidance and just what remains an uncertain volatile environment for the industry? Maybe where do you have the highest degree of confidence or visibility?

Conversely, where -- what do you see as some key risks or launch points? And I guess, as we think about the shape of the year, just given the 1Q and the Q2 guidance, is it playing out as you anticipated?

Geoff Tanner
CEO, President & Director

Yes. So it's playing out very much as expected and as we previously communicated, our plan from the start has known about certain first half headwinds, for example, some shifted promotional activity out of first half and second and known about some second half tailwinds, which we communicated on our last call. If I break that down on the top line, as we look to the second half, we have line of sight to new distribution, some wins there, some merchandising gains, particularly on Quest.

I'm very pleased with our innovation pipeline that we have that will start shipping in the spring and then through the summer. Atkins will start moving past some of its larger distribution laps, for example, at Club. And we expect, as we normally see, elasticities to burn off from pricing. So on the top line, just listing a few drivers there that underpin our confidence in the second half.

On the bottom line, we have line of sight to improved gross margin, underlying profit growth because we mentioned in the script, the -- we'll have the full benefit of pricing. We'll have the full benefit of productivity. I'm very pleased with the productivity progress we've made as an organization, setting us up for a strong second half, but also into '27.

And as mentioned, we've taken more favorable positions in cocoa, which has come down materially. So on the top and on the bottom, we certainly have a lot of confidence that we will -- the business will start to inflect through the second half and into '27.

Christopher Bealer
Chief Financial Officer

And then Peter, it's Chris. I'll just build on Geoff's answer. Consistent with our prior outlook, our EBITDA is generally going to track pretty closely to the gross margin trajectory. Q3 gross margins, for example, will be flattish year-over-year. And Q4 will be the strongest position for us in both gross margin and EBITDA. And EBITDA as an example, we expect it to be up about double digits. And I think importantly, for me, that sets us up nicely for FY '27 on a margin standpoint.

Our next question is from the line of Brian Holland with D.A. Davidson.

Brian Holland
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

I wanted to ask about Quest Bars flat, obviously underperforming vis-a-vis the broader category there. Innovation is contributing nicely. Overload is off to a good start, as you mentioned, et cetera. But obviously also implies then that the core or the legacy SKUs sort of in aggregate are declining. So maybe first question there, just innovation is obviously important. The category thrives off that new product news.

So that's important and obviously encouraging that you guys have accelerated that pipeline. But what do we -- what needs to be done on the legacy bar business just given the sheer size and scale, I mean, is this merchandising that we need to increasingly focus on, which I know you've talked about before? Or does there need to be some sort of rightsizing on some of these tail SKUs in that brand?

Geoff Tanner
CEO, President & Director

Yes. If you look at Quest Bars in the quarter, Q1, they were flat, but we started a little bit more recently, more recent weeks, which we expected. As we mentioned, lapping some prior year promotional events through New Year, New Year, some shift in timing. And we always see a higher initial impact from pricing, which we took on Quest Bar. So what we're seeing on Quest bar right now is very consistent with what we expected and what we said on the last call.

But to your question, we're obviously not happy with flat. That doesn't work. It's unacceptable. We are the leader in the bar segment, and we should be driving it. I think I've talked about this in the past. Over the past year, in response to that, we have developed a comprehensive plan to reaccelerate our bar business, and that includes platform innovation, which you'll see in the spring.

It includes additional merchandising and new distribution that we have line of sight to. And additional marketing that we're going to put behind bars. So right now, we're flat. That's unacceptable. To your point, it's a multipronged plan to reaccelerate bars, inclusive of innovation, but also driving our core bar business through merchandising, through distribution and through marketing.

Obviously, this is a multiyear plan. It will take time, but I'm very confident in the plan, and you should start to see the impact of that in the results in the second half.

Brian Holland
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Appreciate the color. And then pivoting over to OWYN briefly. Obviously, there's a lot of noise right now between the increase in marketing spend, working through the product quality issues and that old inventory. But as we start to move forward, you're giving us metrics around brand awareness, household penetration.

So maybe a 2-part question here. If I look at the relationship between household penetration, I think, 4.5% branded awareness at -- or aided or I know the awareness at like 20%. Is that the right delta today? Or does that imply better or worse conversion of that awareness than if you compare that against other brands that you've managed?

And as we go forward, how should we be judging the step-up in marketing investment and your ability to convert? Is it watching the relationship between household penetration and brand awareness that you're building over time?

Geoff Tanner
CEO, President & Director

Yes. That relationship between 20% aided awareness and 4-ish, 4.5% household penetration pretty standard. So what it does point to is the significant upside opportunity we have on this brand. So while the relationship is pretty standard, those numbers are very low. And that really is a key opportunity for us to drive awareness, which is why we've increased marketing substantially, which then should translate into increased household penetration.

One of the ways in which we plan to accelerate that in addition to marketing is to expand the footprint of OWYN. So right now, we've got a really good shakes business. We'll continue to drive that. We've got distribution upside. We've got a smallish powders business that's growing 50% plus that we plan to put more effort behind. And then you should expect us to bring platform innovation that will expand the footprint of the brand further.

So the key ways to expand household penetration, marketing, which we've increased more than double, innovation to expand the footprint and then continuing to drive our distribution. We see this brand having a tremendous runway where we acquired it's on the leading edge of the clean movement, and we plan to pull all of those levers to drive awareness and drive household penetration.

The next question is from the line of Megan Clapp with Morgan Stanley.

Megan Christine Alexander
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I wanted to stick with OWYN, if we could. So underlying consumption in the quarter clearly strong, I think a bit better than you had actually laid out when we talked last quarter, talked about kind of the gap and the destock related to some of the quality issues in inventory. I wondered if you could just give a little bit more color on how that kind of came up during the quarter, whether it was driven by one or multiple customers?

And then just, Chris, I think you said as you move into the New Year and New You period, you'd expect shipments to better align with consumption. Should we interpret that as there was still maybe a gap at the start of this quarter and it should close as we move through the second quarter? Just trying to kind of understand your level of confidence in consumption, which is clearly strong kind of matching shipments as we move through the balance of the quarter.

Geoff Tanner
CEO, President & Director

Yes, I'll start and turn it over to Chris. To your point, we were pleased with how consumption came in, in Q1, led by some distribution gains at mass test and a club customer. RTDs were solid, as I mentioned earlier, previous question. powders growing 50%. And this does underscore the leadership position we have in plant-based and clean label, which grew 20%. In terms of bridging the gap to sales, as Chris mentioned, the primary driver of Q1 was we came in heavier on inventory, and we had some lingering impact from the quality issue.

Christopher Bealer
Chief Financial Officer

And then Megan, just to build on that, we do believe we're in a better position now in terms of shipping to consumption. As you mentioned in the remarks, the ERP cutover was a big piece of why we were slightly heavy on inventory coming into Q1. We thought that was a prudent action to take to make sure we didn't have any supply disruption.

And then obviously, as Jeff mentioned, the lingering effects of the product issues also had an impact on the quarter. So overall, though, in the long run, we do think consumption is the best measure of brand health. And as I said, we think we're set up now in Q2 to be much more -- much closer in terms of shipment to consumption.

Megan Christine Alexander
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then, Chris, just a follow-up, if I could, on the margin. I think you said at the end of your response to Pete's question that you'll be set up nicely in fiscal '27 from a margin standpoint. I guess when we look at the shape of this year, I think you'll end the year and exit kind of in that mid-36% range on the gross margin and understand there can be kind of seasonality and you probably don't want to give fiscal '27 guidance right now, but is that a good jumping off point as we think about fiscal '27, just that exit rate on 4Q, particularly as you talked about some of the favorability you expect from cocoa?

Christopher Bealer
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. As I talked about, I think, last quarter as well, we do have good line of sight with our supply coverage. And we do obviously know what we paid last year for cocoa and for other commodities, we can see where the prices are. So we feel very confident about our overall gross margin. I think the mid-36s range that you mentioned on Q4 is directionally right. And I think that is, as you said, a good jumping off point for F '27. But clearly, at this point, I'm not going to be guiding on F '27. But all else equal, probably a decent assumption in terms of the starting point for the year.

Operator

Our next questions are from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein.

Alexia Howard
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

Can I ask about margins? I seem to remember that when you first bought OWYN, it was a pretty low-margin business, but you're obviously in the middle of extracting a lot of cost synergy from that. And I also seem to remember that you commented recently on quite a wide discrepancy between where the Quest margins are and the lower margins for Atkins.

And if we look out over the next 18 months, do we see sort of a major ramp on the margin side, both on the gross margin side and on the operating margin side, driven by things like cutting off the tail of unprofitable SKUs and the ongoing cost synergy realization at OWYN, other drivers that you anticipate? I'm really thinking about the gross margin getting back to that sort of 37% territory is there line of sight into that?

Christopher Bealer
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Alexia. Yes, from a margin standpoint, -- in terms of getting back and rebuilding our margins up into that sort of 37-plus range, the biggest drivers really are the pricing and productivity. We know there's a lag. We talked about it last time, pricing productivity lag versus inflation. That lag is going to start to overlap in half 2 of this year. We also, as I said, have good line of sight to cost visibility, both on cocoa and our other commodities.

And we do have a nice tailwind coming from cocoa, which will start to kick in, in Q4 of this year, will flow more into F '27. Obviously, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we do have -- we do see inflation on whey, which is going to offset that to some extent. But those are some pretty big drivers on margin and certainly very much in our control, which makes me very confident on rebuilding our margins. In addition to that, there is the mix impact as we mix out of Atkins, we mix into Quest, that is also obviously going to have a more long-term structural benefit on margins.

And then as you mentioned, I think in the question, yes, we did drive some very nice synergies on OWYN as we integrated it. Those are building through this fiscal year. So those are kind of already embedded in that 3 -- mid-36% range for Q4. That's already sort of fully loaded from an OWYN margin standpoint. And then I guess the final piece I would just put on OWYN, as we talked about, as we build scale and we build, as Jeff mentioned, platform innovation, I would hope certainly that those would certainly be accretive to the OWYN margin as a brand.

Geoff Tanner
CEO, President & Director

The only build I would have on that is Alexia about 18 months ago, we did put in place a very robust and enhanced productivity program. That took 6 or so months to ramp. But as we sit here today, we have strong visibility based on terrific work from this team and our supply chain team, the R&D team, and that will enable us to continue to support our margin that will allow us to continue to support investment in the business.

Our next question is from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair.

Jon Andersen
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Just a couple here. On sales overall flat for the quarter, can you help us a little bit with the composition? How much did pricing help in the first quarter? And how much will pricing -- how much will flow through as we move into the second quarter and second half?

And then I had a question -- a second question on Atkins. I think last quarter, you talked about 10% to 15% of the Atkins business being kind of tail, meaning in the bottom quartile of velocities. Is there an update on that? And what I'm really trying to get at is where you think you are kind of in the process of getting to that optimal assortment for that rightsized assortment on Atkins?

Christopher Bealer
Chief Financial Officer

Jon, I'll take the top line question and maybe Geoff wants to take the Atkins one. Look, for Q1, I think what's important to keep in mind is we had -- yes, we were roughly flat year-over-year, but slightly better than we had anticipated and certainly a little bit better than we guided at the start of the year. Quest and Atkins, we're quite happy with where Q1 landed. Both of them were ahead of expectations.

And OWYN, as we talked about, obviously behind for the reasons we've already stated. In terms of composition of that, pricing really was almost 0 benefit in Q1. The effective date on shelf was really towards the very, very end of October. So we had a very small amount flowing into Q1. So really minimal impact in Q1. And it will be closer to sort of low single-digit benefit for balance to grow, which is consistent with what we said last quarter.

Geoff Tanner
CEO, President & Director

Yes, I'll take the Atkins question. I think it's important to point out that the majority, 2/3 of the declines we're seeing on Atkins today are driven by lost distribution, particular impact at club, which will be almost fully passed in April. But to your question, Atkins, if you look at the business today, as we said in the past, 75% of Atkins sales today come from SKUs in the top half of category velocity, which, in my experience, is generally considered safe.

If you look at just the lowest quartile, 10% to 15%, which typically would be at risk. So no change there. I hope that helps dimensionalize the risk. And we'll say that rather than just lose those SKUs, we believe the right thing to do for the brand, the category and the company is to partner with retailers to drive to an assortment that would include replacing those SKUs with Quest and with OWYN, faster turning SKUs.

I think that's the benefit of the category and the company. What I would say is I have been pleased that we've seen more flowback than we had forecasted on Atkins in Q1 where we've lost distribution. So early days there, but the level of flowback we are seeing into the business, I think partially explains why Atkins had a better than forecasted quarter.

The next question come from the line of Matt Smith with Stifel.

Matthew Smith
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Chris, just a follow-up question on cost visibility and tariff expense. You called out a $4 million headwind from tariffs in the quarter. When would you expect to start to see relief given the revised trade agreements? Should you start to see tariff favorability relative to your previous guidance in the second half of the year? Or does that really start to flow through in fiscal '27?

Christopher Bealer
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks, Matt. I think importantly, again, as we look at total cost, and we see that we have good visibility out. We did get a little bit of relief since we set guidance on tariffs with the especially Annex 3 exemptions. And that will start to flow through. It's going to be flowing through really starting in the second half of the year. Again, when you think about cost of inventory and as it flows through our inventory and we ultimately ship it, there is a timing lag.

So that will be more of a second half benefit and into next year. Again, I'll just refer back to, yes, we have some tariff benefit coming in, in the second half. We have cocoa benefit that's going to start flowing in Q4. But we do have a new sort of headwind that's come in, which is the way inflation. So all in, not concerned overall on cost, and that's why we haven't changed our gross margin guidance for the year. And actually pretty much right on the same number for Q4 in terms of what we were thinking. But yes, from a tariff standpoint, benefit will start playing in the second half.

Matthew Smith
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

And Geoff, as a follow-up to your commentary on capital allocation, the company has been running as a portfolio of brands for some time, and you've been open to adding brands. But are you seeing a change in the category given the insurgent brand dynamics and competitive activity? Is that impacting your M&A view? And when we think about the share repurchase year-to-date has been fairly aggressive. Are you confident in the current brands that you own supporting your long-term algorithm?

Geoff Tanner
CEO, President & Director

That's a good question. So obviously, we haven't changed our framework for capital allocation. Certainly, M&A is something we look at. I think we've got a pretty decent track record with M&A. Right now, as we look at our stock price, which we think is significantly undervalued, we think the right use of cash is to be in there and buying the stock back, given our confidence in the long-term health of the business.

But M&A is something that we're always looking at. There are -- as you mentioned, there are targets out there. Obviously, we want to get it at the right price. So we haven't -- that hasn't changed. Our buyback position is opportunistic in a sense and that we view our stock is significantly undervalued, and we think the best use is to go in there and buy it back at these cheap levels.

Christopher Bealer
Chief Financial Officer

And I would just -- Matt, I'll just build on Geoff's answer that we have a very strong balance sheet. Obviously, we took, I think, advantage of the stock price, and we also took advantage of our refinancing window to increase our debt level a little bit like modestly, still less than a turn at this present time. We project that to still be around a turn by the end of the year.

And we use that extra -- those extra funds to accelerate our stock buyback while our stock is cheap. And I think the authorization increase from our Board recently of another $200 million, I think it's just in my mind, reflects our confidence in the long-term strength of our business and long-term strength of our balance sheet. And while we still have attractive share prices, we'll continue to use our cash accordingly.

The next question is from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen.

Robert Moskow
TD Cowen, Research Division

I wanted to dig a little deeper into the clinical study that you're conducting on GLP-1 users and you say these are users who are following the Atkins nutritional approach. Can I assume that this means that you followed users who are on the Atkins diet? And if so, what's the next step, Geoff? Like what would you do with the results of this study to help you market the brand? How would you use it to help you retain distribution with retailers? Just a little bit more info on like what you intend to do with the results.

Geoff Tanner
CEO, President & Director

Yes. So the role of Atkins has always been to help people lose or maintain weight. And as we saw -- continue to see consumers turn to GLP-1 drugs to help them with this, 2 years ago, so a couple of years ago, we undertook a pilot clinical study to test whether Atkins could be a valuable tool or companion to people on the drug. So we had 2 groups of patients on -- who were taking the drug, one group using the Atkins diet and the other using a more traditional low fat diet.

We just got the results back in last month. So it's still very early, but those results were very encouraging. Patients on the Atkins diet have taken the drug, tended to retain more muscle mass, which is a critical issue for people on the drug, tended to experience fewer side effects, few headaches, nausea with gas, and there were some other significant differences on metabolic outcomes, particularly for those with diabetes.

But it was a pilot study, but nonetheless, very, very encouraging that Atkins can play an important role with a lot more to learn. What you will start to see, to your point, is us leveraging the study results and our New Year New You media, so starting in the next few weeks, you'll see us start to message around this, start to target around this. And literally, as we speak, because these results are very fresh, our teams are in front of retailers who are also trying to figure out how to meet the needs of GLP-1 patients.

So over the next few months, our selling team will be out in front of the trade in front of retailers, talking to them about the results, talking to them about the importance of action. So it's early. It's a pilot study. With that being said, we're very encouraged and you'll start to see us execute against this over the coming months.

The next question is from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.

Stephen Robert Powers
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

A couple of questions around planning assumptions, just going back to Quest Salty. The first one is maybe just give us an update. You talked about distribution gains generally in the forecast. Curious as to what your distribution outlook is on Quest Salty specifically? And if there are any gains embedded in the full year outlook, number one. Number two is just more generally on forecasting in that business. I think as I think about it, there are kind of competing factors on the one hand, favorably.

I think there's a greater consumer awareness and consumer acceptance of kind of protein-based salty snacks, which is part of credit to your success. On the other hand, that has brought with it increasing competition from other smaller independent brands as well as increasingly from conventional brands looking at the category. So just curious if you step back and think about the -- those dynamics, whether that has changed your approach to forecasting in the salty business.

Geoff Tanner
CEO, President & Director

Steve, we could not be more pleased with our salty business, plus 40% in the quarter. Admittedly, we had some easier laps a year ago, but could not be more pleased. The core drivers are innovation. We've got new flavors, new forms, pack sizes, exclusives retailers, which are performing extremely well. We continue to build distribution, gain merchandising, displays across the store, away from home, gym, airports, hotels.

And I'm not sure if you've seen our new campaign, but it's pretty heavily weighted towards salty. So those are the key drivers. As we look to the second half, we're very confident in the continued momentum of Salty. We have line of sight to new distribution. We have line of sight to significant merchandising gains. And part of this is because retailers view Salty as highly incremental to the category. And as a result, they're rewarding us with new distribution and new merchandising. So a lot of confidence in the momentum.

As we think long term, I do want to remind that Quest is the pioneer of this segment. We built it from the ground up. It's been growing for a year at a high clip, and that reflects that we know we have a superior product. And really importantly, consumers trust Quest and trust our salty business has tremendous authenticity in the space. Salty is a $50 billion category. We only have 10% household penetration.

Awareness is still relatively low. I've seen the multiyear pipeline. You should expect us to be looking at other forms of salty. We have no intention of taking our foot off the gas. Obviously, we've been operating under the assumption that competition is coming. The growth, the demand for this product just makes it obvious. But we're highly confident in the strength of our brand, strength of our product, our competitive moat from a supply chain perspective. And both near term and long term, we have tremendous confidence in this business.

Christopher Bealer
Chief Financial Officer

Just want to add, Steve, to what Geoff said. Look, if you think about Quest as a brand and look at the areas that we're already building strong businesses, I think it's very important for me that Quest as a brand can absolutely play across the entire salty universe. Today, we have a business that's really an enormous chips business, but there's a lot of other areas in salty across the store where I strongly believe that Quest can build a meaningful business. And for that reason, that's one of the reasons we've been resourcing against that, both internally and with our co-manufacturers.

Stephen Robert Powers
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Yes, very clear. And I know we're late in the call. Just a quick last question for me, if I could. Apologies if I missed it, but just going back to OWYN. You mentioned in the remarks in the slides that if you think about the long-term path to growth that innovation in new categories will play an important role. I'm curious if fiscal '26 is too early to see some of that or if we should expect that as the year progresses?

Geoff Tanner
CEO, President & Director

It's a big opportunity for us. One of the -- if you remember, Steve, it's one of the reasons that we cited why we're so excited about OWYN was to be able to combine our very talented R&D organization and let them loose on OWYN. So there's a very strong pipeline. What I'll say is you should expect to see probably the first foray from us, I'd say, certainly this fiscal, we probably put the timing around that. I'm really excited about the opportunity here, yes, significant.

Operator

Our final question is from the line of Tyler Prause with Stephens.

Tyler Prause

RTD is becoming an increasingly competitive space. How should we think about growth within this part of your portfolio? And is this a unique subcategory where we could see consumption for Quest, OWYN and Atkins all positive this year?

Geoff Tanner
CEO, President & Director

No RTD is certainly competitive. It's not surprising. For a while, the category was somewhat supply constrained, I think that limited the extent of competition. Unsurprisingly, you're seeing some new entrants into the category. What I'd point out is the category is still growing 10% plus in RTDs, which is significant. When it comes to our brands, I'll start with OWYN, very uniquely positioned within that category.

It's not just another RTD milk shake or chocolate, a strawberry flavor. It is positioned as the leading clean and plant-based proposition in the market, very differentiated and retailers see that, consumers see that. So I feel very confident. This clean movement, I think, is in the early innings, and we intend to write it as the leader. So I think from a perspective, OWYN is very differentiated. We've been very pleased with how Quest has performed in the space.

Quest has the highest protein level at 45 grams, phenomenal tasting, which you'd expect from Quest. So a differentiated position there. And Atkins plays a very different job in the category. Atkins is about helping consumers maintain their weight. It's a different job, and I think a differentiated job, particularly when we start to leverage the GLP-1 findings where shakes could be a very important tool to consumers on the drug.

So we believe that we have 3 very differentiated position -- differentially positioned brands inside a category that's still robust, still growing double digit. So we have a lot of confidence in the future growth here.
