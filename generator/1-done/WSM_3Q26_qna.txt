Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Max Rakhlenko from TD Cowen.

Maksim Rakhlenko
TD Cowen, Research Division

Congrats on the nice quarter. So first, can you just discuss the elasticity that you're seeing in the business as you selectively increase prices? And how we should think about the impact to comps from transactions versus ticket in 3Q?

Laura Alber
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Max. We look at prices constantly across our brands, across categories and with our competition. And you know we sell a wide range of products. And so there's not one quick answer to elasticity because in some there's room to take up prices. In other cases, you need to take down prices based on what the market is doing.

This is why we're so focused on innovation and bringing new innovative and exclusive products to market because that gives us better pricing power. Also, I would say that pricing is not just about the product itself, but also the service and the experience. And we have been really, really focused, as you know, on improving our service, which has been a huge driver of our op margin, which I'm sure we'll talk a lot about today.

But that's a big -- especially as we come up against the holiday season, it's a big deal for customers deciding where to buy their gifts, especially large tickets. If they want to buy gifts from people they trust, they can return things to and that they're going to stand behind their product quality and they can get instructions about how to use that expensive espresso machine. So it's not just one metric, and it's not just one category. It's going to be going to be different depending on the product you asked me about.

Maksim Rakhlenko
TD Cowen, Research Division

Got it. And then, Jeff, you noted that it's taking longer for tariffs to flow through. Just how should we consider the impact of tariffs over the next several quarters as it does sound like 4Q will see a pickup? And then just any guideposts on modeling for the next several quarters?

Jeff Howie
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, let me explain why the tariffs are taking longer to flow through. I think it's important to unpack that. And first, it's really due to the delayed effective dates. For example, the August 7 reciprocal tariff, which applies in most countries like China and Vietnam, et cetera, had an exception for goods that were on the water that had to be received before 10/5.

Another example is with the India tariffs that were effective on August 27, there was an exception for goods in the water to be received before 9/17. So this means that these tariffs do not start being applied to new receipts until mid- to late third quarter. And then on top of that, we aggressively front-loaded receipts to bring in inventory at lower tariff rates than are in effect today.

So the combination of these 2 really advantaged us in Q3. As we look to Q4, we've certainly said that the tariffs will have a larger impact upon our margin, and that is embedded in our guidance. As we look beyond Q4, it's a little early to talk about '26. There's a lot that could change between now and then, especially with the tariff landscape. So we'll save that conversation for March.

Your next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo.

Zachary Fadem
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Could we start with your take on broader category performance from Q2 to Q3 and whether you saw underlying improvement there? And then just curious, stepping back, how you would frame the improvement we've seen in furnishings in your category relative to some of the broader macro and pressures that we've seen in home improvement and other bigger ticket categories.

Laura Alber
President, CEO & Director

We're really pleased with our continuing improvement across quarters and brands. And in particular, the West Elm increase in comps is really exciting for us to see because we expected it to happen, and there's nothing more fulfilling when you see a strategy come to fruition. And I still think there's a lot of room left to go in West Elm as they build out certain categories and their seasonal assortments.

And we've been continuing to improve our in-store experiences, and that's been really helping. But in terms of the broader merchandise categories across brands, we have been aware, as everyone is that the housing market has not recovered, and that is really most correlated with furniture and to be able to improve our furniture comps without a significant improvement in housing is a really, really strong sign.

And we love that because a furniture collection that we introduced in the season this year, we can build upon for next year with new piece types and also better inventory stocking positions. And so the continuation of our furniture strength is very important to the short term and the longer term. And then in the holiday season, the categories that are exciting, we saw Dorm pick up from Q2 to Q3.

Back-to-school is the broader category for that, and it was a strong season and really, really a good season for us. The Halloween product categories were strong, autumnal and Thanksgiving. also, we're not selling Thanksgiving yet, obviously, but we're close. And so we've been pleased with our results there. It's too early to comment about holiday, and we're actually on the call a week earlier than we were last year.

So those of you are wondering about the lack of comments there. It's just a little bit too early to comment. But based on what we've seen with the other seasonal holidays, we can see that, that's a competitive advantage for us. There's not many other people out there that have the assortment that allows customers to really decorate and entertain for the holidays. And especially at this time of the year, it's a real strength that's a traffic driver for us.

Your next question comes from the line of Cristina Fernandez from Telsey Advisory Group.

Cristina Fernandez
Telsey Advisory Group LLC

So I want to follow up a little bit on that last comment on holiday. As we look at the implied Q4 revenue guidance, it's pretty wide. So could you comment on the low end versus high end and your ability to continue this comp trend as you face a more difficult year-over-year comparison?

Laura Alber
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Cristina. Holiday launch season and then it includes January. We are really focused on great price selling. And this has been an important part of our margin profile all year and the improvements that you've seen. And we have amazingly, we've had great success in our margin improvement. Even with the tariffs on top of everything.

And as we go into the holiday season, we continue to have opportunity from a year-over-year perspective in pulling back on promotions. And so we're focused on right price selling and hope to have less promotions than last year, hence, the wide range of comp performance. That's one piece of it. The second is when you look at the multiyear numbers, we're mindful of our strong holiday last year.

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict from Baird.

Peter Benedict
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I guess two. One would be the market seems to be really concerned about how you're going to be able to digest these tariffs as they ultimately come through despite your ability to do so to date. I think expectations next year for operating margins to be lower in the first half of the year. But maybe, Jeff, I'm not asking for specific guidance, but just how should we think about the ability of the business to just even maintain operating margins in the face of what you know about tariffs as they sit today? That's my first question.

And then my second question would be around unit growth. Laura, it sounded like maybe a little bit more of an offensive posture there, particularly around West Elm. We know that in aggregate, your units have been kind of coming down. Are you signaling a change there? Should we be thinking about -- I'm just thinking about the magnitude of unit growth we might expect as we look out on the horizon?

Jeff Howie
Executive VP & CFO

Peter. So where is the operating margin going? That's a great question. But if we look beyond our current guidance, that's not really a question we're going to answer today. It's too early to start discussing '26 guidance. Our focus is on the holiday season delivering in Q4. And the real reason here is the tariff landscape has been incredibly volatile.

Just look at what's happened over the past several quarters. Every quarter, there's been new tariffs, repeal tariffs, everything is changing. And there's a lot of uncertainty in this front. I would point out that India is one of our largest sources of goods and where that tariff is going, which is currently at 50% is an open question. We also have the Supreme Court decision on IEPA tariffs pending.

We'll see where that goes. So it's a little hard to understand beyond our current guidance and beyond this year and Q4, where the tariff landscape is going to impact us. We believe that our 6-point mitigation plan that Laura and I have been articulating all year, combined with the power of our operating model will allow us to offset a large portion of the tariffs, but the ultimate amount depends upon where the tariffs ultimately land.

What we're really focused on is delivering the current quarter. And everything we know about our ability to offset the current tariffs is embedded within our guidance. In terms of your second question, Peter, where is unit growth going? Look, we've been saying all along that we have done an incredible job, and I want to complement our entire organization regarding our retail repositioning strategy. And there's been multiple legs of the strategy. There's been closing underperforming stores, which I think everyone knows, we've closed about 17% of our stores since 2019. It's about repositioning stores from some of the tired indoor malls to more vibrant lifestyle centers. And it's also been about opening new stores. And we see opportunity for new store growth, particularly in the West Elm brand with Rejuvenation, with GreenRow potentially.

And there's a lot of opportunity for us to continue to grow stores. In terms of where overall store count growth is going, as we've been saying all year, it will be mid-single-digit closures this year. And I think we're not necessarily guiding '26, but I don't think we'll see a substantial change in the overall store count as we look towards '26. There's still more room to go on our repositioning strategy, but there's also white space opportunity to infill. And there's some great new locations that we're working on that will come online in '26 and in '27.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers from JPMorgan.

Christopher Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So two quick ones. So I guess playing devil's advocate on the compare in the fourth quarter, Laura, furniture pull forward is behind you. There's a lot of momentum around self-help initiatives. And obviously, there's a tick of pricing coming through here. So as you think about where we are in the cycle, particularly with housing not helpful, why couldn't the growth rate just stay at the growth rate considering where we are?

And then a quick one on gross margin. Understanding there was some shift on timing, but asking the question another way, did the drivers in terms of -- in the fourth quarter in terms of the expected tariff headwind versus the expected benefit from the mitigation strategies, did you change those at all in your outlook?

Laura Alber
President, CEO & Director

Pull forward first, I don't see any reason to believe we've seen pull forward of anything for that matter. We absolutely could be at the same comp, if not higher. We have a wide range. I was just explaining the differences of why you might look at it and say it's a little bit lower than where you've been. It's very important that we don't play in the promotional game.

It's a key aspect of our strategy. At the same time, we're going to have great deals for Black Friday. We have great deals right now for early Black Friday. We bought into them. We have vendor partnerships on them. But we're not going to have as much -- we hope we're not going to have as many needs to promote as we did last year. And so that's the only hesitation on the comp side.

And then in terms of the tariff impact in Q4, it's sizably more than Q4 because of the way that the cost flows through every single quarter. And so we did a fantastic job, great success with our mitigation plan in Q3 and throughout the year, and we will continue to do that. And in fact, it's amazing to see the new opportunities that we're finding in supply chain.

Supply chain has been just a tremendous positive this year in delivering op margin. And what's great about it, as you know, is it means the customer is getting their products delivered more smoothly and on time and without damage. And that's all good for the brand. It's fantastic for the P&L. And there's still room. As we look at Q4 on the op margin side and the supply chain savings, there's more to go there.

We're really optimistic about our ACDC, which is our new GC that came up last year. And honestly, we're doing better than we have been with that, and that could be -- that could really help us, especially because the calendar this year for Christmas similar to last year is pretty tight. So we want to ship it late and ship it perfectly and not disappoint anyone.

That's why people come to us and shop online later with us like they do Amazon and others because they trust us to deliver before Christmas. So there's a lot of really good things happening. But in terms of the impact of tariffs, please don't get ahead of us on Q4 in terms of the margin because the tariffs are going to have a greater impact, as you can see in our guidance and the implied Q4 guidance than they did in Q3.

If you look at our op margin ex tariffs, it's expanding. And so for all those that are worried about this, just realize that this goes into the base and we're done with it, and we move forward, and it's about outperforming our competition and continuing to deliver for our shareholders and most importantly, for our customers and giving them incredibly beautiful, well-designed, high-quality product at the best price in the market.

Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Matuszewski from Jefferies.

Jonathan Matuszewski
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I had one question and one follow-up. The first question was just on the consumer. You mentioned a better response to full price selling than it seems like what you planned for. So just from like a strategy perspective here, how does that minimal elasticity kind of inform your customer targeting efforts going forward? And is what you're seeing giving you more confidence to target a higher-end consumer, a higher income consumer more in the future than in the past? And are there strategies in place to do that? That's my first question.

Laura Alber
President, CEO & Director

Yes, it's a great question. We're lucky where we sit, but we love all our customers. So we want to give them the best price if it's the first apartment, first baby or if it's their tenth one -- and we do see when we look at our tic tac toe as owning the home that we haven't covered the real super high end at scale yet. It's not surprising to me that Rejuvenation is doing so well. Why do we have such great growth, it's expensive, it's absolutely gorgeous, high-quality product.

I hope that you've all visited a store, bought some products or seen it in someone's house because when you see it, you understand why we're really growing that business and why we believe so strongly to be our next billion dollar brand. That sits at the high end. GreenRow sits at the high end.

We haven't talked about it a lot, because it's tiny, but we're seeing that it's a new aesthetic. It is very, very original that is not in the marketplace and that is entirely green products and people care about that. At least that customer cares about that. And so that's at the high end. And we see that we can have retail stores in that brand, which tells me it's bigger than you might think. And then there's Williams-Sonoma Home, which we continue to see as an opportunity for us into the future.

But don't mistake the importance of us also covering the upper middle customer, the Pottery Barn, the West Elm and making sure that also those brands are so appealing that people trade into that. I can decorate your house, more beautifully and more affordably than the high end, why wouldn't you come to us? And by the way, we'll do the whole thing for you and we'll set it up.

And I think you'll see that we can do it for a fraction of the price of what other people do and have it be super interesting and gorgeous. So we're going after all those pieces and there's opportunity right across the bar from what we define as our value customer, which is different than the market all the way to the high-end consumer.

our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.

Simeon Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Laura, Jeff, can I ask on tariffs again? The 6-point plan seems to be beneficial, and it sounds like the elasticities aren't awful. What's the chance that we get to the fourth quarter or even the first quarter as this inventory turns, that the impacts are going to be a lot more minimal than we think.

And I'm just trying to size up the conviction that we haven't seen anything yet. And then if some of the IEPA stuff gets, I don't know, invalidated, do you suspect that industry prices go back down? Or do you think retail prices, especially ones that have already changed, they're just going to hold?

Laura Alber
President, CEO & Director

First of all, I just want to say that the last thing I want to think is that we're immune to tariffs. We've done a really great job of offsetting them so far, but the amount that they hit us in Q4 is sizably different than it was in Q3. So just -- that's why look at our guidance, please, and understand the impact. IEPA, there's other tariffs I'm not focused on that.

We're focused on how we give in the current tariff environment, the greatest value to our consumers. And where should we be pricing things and where should we be moving things. So I wouldn't spend a lot of time worrying about that. I think it's just one more thing that could change and be kind of distracting in the short term. There's also really good things that like if the India tariff is revealed that or reduced by half, that would be great for us.

But all that is a backdrop that affects the entire industry. And once it's in and it's rolled through on a yearly basis, we're done with it. So I just -- as I said, just to recap, please don't think that we are in Q4 and beyond. We will offset as much as we possibly can. We've done a better job than I think we even thought we could do in offsetting all of it this quarter. But we have a few things going on in Q4 that I want to make sure, Jeff reminded you in his prepared remarks, I'll let him remind you again about the 53rd week.

Jeff Howie
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean a couple of other things that I want to highlight, too, Simeon, is, and as Laura said, don't get ahead of us there. We did have an improvement in our merchandise margins, particularly against what we expected in Q3. But it goes back to the timing factor that I talked about, I think, on the first question. The effective dates were delayed for all the tariffs.

So as we get to Q4, there will be a substantially larger impact to our operating margin than there was in Q3. And our guidance embeds in there our best estimates of what that impact is inclusive of all of our tariff mitigation efforts. So I can't say it any other way other than we do not expect a repeat of Q3 and Q4, which is what our guidance is. In terms of the 53rd week, I do want to remind everyone that this is a 53rd week for Williams -- we are coming up against the 53rd week for Williams-Sonoma, Inc.

On the year, it was worth 150 basis points to revenue growth and 20 basis points to operating margin. But in Q4, where the 53rd week comes into play, it had a pretty big impact at 510 basis points of revenue growth and 60 basis points of operating margin growth. So just on that, the 53rd week and those 60 basis points, we would be down normally on a year-over-year 13-week -- I'm sorry, yes, 13-week to 13-week comparison.

Your next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone from Citigroup.

Steven Zaccone
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I wanted to ask on Pottery Barn because the business decelerated a little bit there on the 2-year stack, and it's actually lagging the rest of the segments of the business. You referenced some pullback in promotions. Can you just talk about what's new this year?

Because I think that's been the strategy for the past couple of years. And when you think about the performance of that business, what are you seeing from a competitive perspective? Any sort of kind of trade down from the consumer and to deal with some of these earlier questions around pricing, is there anything to call out from a pricing perspective competitive-wise?

Laura Alber
President, CEO & Director

We haven't seen that yet. Pottery Barns furniture has improved this year, especially on the multiyear stack, and that's been good to see. They did have more promotions to reduce out of the base than you might have expected. And so we continue to work on that, and there's still opportunity.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett.

Charles Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Laura, just bigger picture, a lot of people have asked about the tariffs. I want to ask a little bit about category growth and how you see sustainability moving into 2026. Broadly speaking, a lot of your peers are doing better. Do you think that continues? And then one more near term, just cadence throughout the quarter. Some of your peers have had a lot of volatility. Anything you want to highlight for us and anything you want to speak to so far in November?

Laura Alber
President, CEO & Director

I do want to talk about the excitement we have as we look forward. We have not seen a housing recovery. It's like the worst housing market in the last 4 years, as you know. And that is a big deal. Now there's really not a lot of great signs that it's getting better quickly, but there are some green shoots.

And I personally am very optimistic about housing next year. That would be a big change for us if that happens because we know that when you move, you buy a lot, when you refurnish your house. And we've been very good at getting the remodeler and the redecorator to come to us, but we're excited to be ready with a much more powerful furniture supply chain than we've ever had before when those sales come to us.

And we know that when that turns and you see upside again, it's a really big deal. Some people I don't think they're going to be ready for it. But the things we've done to really improve our supply chain are so strategic. I believe and have always believed that the person that owns the furniture network is the one who wins the whole thing. And that is where we've been focused and we continue to build and have all sorts of tech projects in play to make that happen.

And you can see it in our numbers this year, how much improvement year-on-year. I read through last year's script, -- and it's funny when you read it because we were talking about all the supply chain improvements then. But I think if you had asked me, I wouldn't have expected that we would have this much more. And yet we still have more, and that's what's exciting when you think about the power of our operating model in this multi-brand, multichannel company and where this could go in the future as furniture recovery.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS.

Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Laura, one of the interpretations of your -- some of your comments over the last hour is that Williams-Sonoma has gone through this significant change where it's reduced promotions, improved its profitability while it's been able to drive consistent sales growth. And now it may be at the point at which it can no longer lower promotional activity without it having some impact on the sales. Is that the right interpretation of what has been said on this call?

And second, was the magnitude of the benefit to your margin in the third quarter from selling older, lower-cost inventory at new higher prices equal to or greater than it might have been in the second quarter such that we should think about these not repeating in 2026, understanding you're not providing any guidance on 2026 at this point.

Laura Alber
President, CEO & Director

In terms of your first question, I mean, you took some liberty there, Michael. I think what I'm saying is that key strategies for our company continue to work. And it has been a focus on innovative product design, high quality, high service and a regular price business, investing in our brands, investing in our tech stack, our supply chain to deliver great operating margins.

But I will remind you, our key -- our first initiative this year was return to growth. I kept joking it's 1, 2 and 3 return to growth. We are obsessed with where we can grow, what brand it is, which categories it is and how we outperform. So do not mistake that, that is where our head is and what we're driving towards. On the second question, I'll hand over to Jeff.

Jeff Howie
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Michael, honestly, I'm not tracking with you on the question because actually, our margin expansion year-over-year in Q2 was -- gross margin was 220 basis points. There's only 70 basis points in Q3, with the difference, of course, being the impact of the tariffs.

So I'm not sure I understood your question, but there was a greater impact of the tariffs in Q3. And while certainly, we have our mitigation efforts, the tariff impact will increase sequentially quarter-over-quarter every year this year. And as we said on the call, it will have an impact on us in Q4 in a much more substantial way than it did in prior quarters this year.

Operator

Your next question, and this will be the final question comes from the line of Oliver Wintermantel from Evercore ISI.

Oliver Wintermantel
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And yes, I think the message on gross margin in 4Q came across. I just want to focus on SG&A. You guys have lowered general expenses for the last several quarters. And especially in 4Q, I think there was 80 basis points in incentive comp headwind and advertising was also up a headwind of 30 basis points in the fourth quarter. So maybe could you talk a little bit about SG&A moving parts into the fourth quarter, how you expect that to shake out?

Jeff Howie
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean, as you know, we don't guide to specific lines. We guide to top line and the bottom line as it gives us the flexibility to pull different levers as we see results come in. In Q3, our higher employment expense was really almost entirely attributable to higher incentive compensation due to our strong performance year-to-date.

And then as I explained in our prepared remarks, advertising deleveraged about 20 basis points because we saw some opportunities during Q3 to spend some additional advertising in the digital space. And one of our competitive advantages is our in-house marketing team that has ability across our portfolio of brands to test scale and optimize our spend. And they saw some opportunity to spend in Q3 that gave us great returns, drove incremental traffic to the web and higher revenue per visit, and so we leaned into that.

So as we think about Q4, we don't guide to specific lines, but our approach is always the same as we're looking to control our SG&A, but where we see opportunities that are going to give us good return on investment, we will, of course, lean into those. But it all depends upon the overall macro.

Laura Alber
President, CEO & Director

And I thought that it might be worth spending another minute even though we're a couple of minutes past the hour, talking about our SG&A reductions due to our AI initiatives. because we were joking earlier that we have a 6-point mitigation plan for tariffs. I think maybe we should launch our AI because we're seeing some really exciting results, both on the sales side and also on the margin. I'll let Sameer make a few comments about that before we close the call.

Sameer Hassan
Chief Technology & Digital Officer

Sure. Thank you, Laura. Like Laura mentioned earlier, in Q3, we are seeing really, really impactful results. She shared a couple of the data points around our customer service automation. She shared our launch of Olive, our AI again, that's customer-facing. If you haven't used that, I really encourage you to go the Williams-Sonoma site today. It's super helpful for planning for the holidays and is driving sales, driving engagement, driving loyalty.

It's really exciting. And we're already -- just on the topic of SG&A, we're already seeing reduced payroll costs where automation absorbs -- AI automation absorbs repeatable work, reduce vendor costs when we streamline external spend. And we're also seeing the same tech grow the top line. In supply chain, we're cutting out of market shipments, improving routes, lowering damages, replacements, trimming shipping costs. Inventory, we're using AI to raise in-stock rates on key items, all the stuff supports conversion.

It's driving down costs, but it's also driving the top line. Digital guided journeys, better content coverage. All of this is driving SG&A leverage. It's all of it's driving reduced costs, but it's also driving demand leverage, which is really exciting to see it impact both on the cost side as well as the top line side. So we really see this compounding benefit as we head into 2026. I'm really excited about the continued impact we're seeing from our AI road map.
