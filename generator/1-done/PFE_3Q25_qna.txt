[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities.

Vamil Divan
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

I'm going to have to defer the Metsera questions to other analysts, but curious to hear what you say there. I'll just ask a couple more on the commercial side. So one, Vyndamax, obviously you're facing more competition there. Surprised to see the performance, there was a little bit of sequential decline. So maybe you can just comment on the pricing and sort of market share dynamics you're seeing in that space, obviously, with the new competitors.

And then similar question on Padcev. Obviously, great data that you shared at ESMO. The commercial uptake for the quarter at least was a little bit less than we thought. So maybe just how you expect the muscle invasive indication, assuming you get that here soon to impact uptake of that program and kind of drive upside to where the numbers are right now?

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Thank you, Vamil. Aamir?

Aamir Malik

Sure. Vamil, thanks for the question. So let me start with your question on Vynda. And I'll just -- I want to level set a couple of things about Vynda, and then I'll talk about the performance in the quarter. So there's obviously new competition in the category, and it's important to note that Vynda is still the only ATTR-CM product that has statistically significant reductions in both mortality and CV-related hospitalizations together and as a stand-alone. And it's also the only product where there is a once-daily capsule, placebo-like safety and near complete TTR stabilization.

And we've got 90% access for Vyndamax across the U.S. Now with regards to the quarter, there are a couple of different dynamics that are happening. First of all, we saw very strong demand growth, and that's reinforced by our continued market share leadership, both on a TRx basis, clearly, but also in terms of first-line share. Now that volume growth was offset by 2 gross to net headwinds. One is the IRA manufacturer rebates, which we've talked about before. And the second is what we alluded to last quarter, which is payer contracting that took place in the third quarter.

So Vyndamax is performing exactly where we thought it would and consistent with what we guided and performance continues to reflect strong diagnosis, broad access, improving affordability dynamics, and that's going to continue to grow our volume. We are seeing competition that [indiscernible] is taking some first-line share from treatment-naive patients and [indiscernible] has driven minimal switching to date. And as we kind of look forward on Vynda, we'll see some of these dynamics continue into Q4 as well, where we expect continued volume growth, but the 2 GTN drivers that I described will certainly impact our net sales, but Vynda is performing in the way that we expected.

On your question with regards to Padcev, we're, again, very encouraged by how Padcev is doing. For us, we look at this through 2 lenses. First is the a/mUC population, where we currently have about 55% share among cisplatin-ineligible patients and 45% to 50% share among cisplatin-eligible patients. So there is headroom for us to continue to focus on that segment of the market. I think your question with regards to how Padcev performed on consensus is related to the comment that Dave made, which is as part of integrating the Seagen products into the Pfizer portfolio in Q2, we moved from a drop ship model to a wholesaler model.

So that resulted in a onetime growth in our Q2 sales. So you have to grow products off of that adjusted for 2 to 3 weeks of inventory. So as we cycle into Q4, we expect the whole Seagen portfolio, including Padcev to return to growth. And then finally, on MIBC, we're excited about the possibility as a result of both the 303 and also 304 trials that are ongoing, and that will open up a patient population of close to 22,000 patients to help with the next rise of Padcev growth.

Congrats on the performance in the quarter. So my question is on Metsera. Could you just comment on the legal process ahead? I know that Pfizer is arguing that Novo's acquisition of Metsera would be anticompetitive. And even if the FTC doesn't allow it, it could be anticompetitive. So could you just talk us through the clock and the process for courts to hear Pfizer's arguments?

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Thank you, Dave. As I said in my opening comments, it is very difficult for us to start commenting when we have all these legal issues pending, right, as we speak. But I will repeat what I did say, which is kind of an answer to your question, not on the timing, but we don't see how Novo's deal can be superior. It is an illegal attempt by a foreign company to do an end run around antitrust laws, taking advantage of the government shutdown. What they want to achieve, not to get the products, to destroy them. What they want is to catch and kill an emerging competitor, which is a significant antitrust concern given Novo's dominant market position. So all I can say to this that we are continuing to pursue all legal resources. Thank you. Next question, please.

We'll go next to Asad Haider with Goldman Sachs.

Asad Haider
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I guess just for Albert and Dave, just a quick high-level question on BD. What's the plan if Metsera doesn't work out for some reason? And then second, on 2026, any early framing on guidance pushes and pulls, specifically on how we should think about OpEx with and without Metsera? And then any additional color on how to think about the dilution you mentioned from your recent MFN deal with the administration?

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

I will send the question to Dave because there are a lot of financial also elements. And then if Andrew wants to add something on the BD.

David Denton
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So maybe we'll start with business development. Obviously, the company has still significant resources to understand and how to deploy successfully transactions to bring science in-house, and we will continue to work aggressively to do so across all of our 4 therapeutic areas, and we continue to work across the globe to identify potential candidates for acquisition to help bring new and innovative medicines to patients.

So that's still a very ongoing focused activity for the company. I think it's probably a little early to talk exactly about 2026. You heard me give a little color in the sense that clearly, we're making investments today and those investments carry over into '26 and beyond with either Metsera or 3SBio to bring these innovative medicines to market. Those will have a slightly dilutive effect to our operating performance next year. We will then wrap all that together with the puts and takes of '26 when we give guidance by the end of this year.

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Anything to add on BD, Andrew?

Andrew Baum
Chief Strategy & Innovation Officer, Executive VP

Yes. I mean I'd echo what Dave said that we are very active in all geographies, especially in China. You saw the 3SBio, which has a foundational asset to become the backbone across multiple indications. And the same is true in China and beyond across all the main therapeutic areas. We've increased the size of our team in China, in particular, and we have very active efforts. And when we have something to inform you, you'll certainly be the first to know.

We'll go next to Geoff Meacham with Citibank.

Geoffrey Meacham
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I guess one for Albert or Dave. When you look at the manufacturing investments you're making as part of the MFN agreement relative to the operational cost efficiencies, how would you rank those as priorities? I guess, both seem to have 3-year time frames. I'm just trying to get a sense of the incremental dollar and the strategy there.

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Dave?

David Denton
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Clearly, there are important elements of our strategy. We're going to clearly invest in the U.S. from a production perspective. We're working now to work through our plans with the new agreement with the U.S. government on how to effectively deploy our capacity here in the U.S. and further build it out. So more to come. We will also provide some color to that when we give guidance for 2026. But we will be able to improve our operating -- manufacturing operating infrastructure and at the same time, invest in manufacturing here in the U.S. And those 2 are not necessarily completely in conflict with one another. We'll be able to do both.

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Next question please.

We'll go next to Courtney Breen with Bernstein.

Courtney Breen
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Thank you so much for answering our questions today. I really wanted to understand and perhaps another question on net zero, but from a different angle. I wanted to understand, in your mind, what factors supported Pfizer in garnering that unprecedented early termination of the waiting period from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. That would be really helpful.

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

I'm not sure I understood the question.

Francesca DeMartino
Chief Investor Relations Officer

The FTC clearance.

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Why the FTC clearance?

Francesca DeMartino
Chief Investor Relations Officer

If there are any factors that drove the early...

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

If there are any -- no, I think the FTC made their own decision. Of course, they were aware of this question. So I don't want to speak for them, but they decided that it is appropriate in the middle of a foreign attempt to supervening to just release our deal, which is now clear. So that's all.

David Denton
Executive VP & CFO

I think it does further demonstrate the strength of our deal and the pathway to clearance and the pathway for us to be able to further develop these products and take them to the marketplace in a very rapid fashion. This is helpful to patients long term, is helpful to prices long term under our management and our direction with these assets.

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes, and should not be surprised, right, because we all understand that's the epitome of antitrust conflict. For the entire pipeline of Metsera it is the entire pipeline of Novo plus they have a dominant position with the current products that they have. Of course, FTC would worry about that. I don't want to speak for themselves, but it is something that it is -- everybody understands. All right. Next question, please.

We'll go next to Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.

Terence Flynn
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Maybe 2 for me. You've previously talked about Elrexfio being a key driver for you over the long term. We noticed that MagnetisMM-5 trial was pushed out data into 2026. We know J&J had a similar trial in a similar patient population that just read out. So maybe you could just remind us of any potential differences here in terms of your trial versus their trial and why there might be a difference in timing given they started around the same time?

And the second question is just a clarification on Paxlovid dynamics for the quarter. It looks like by our math, price per script went up over last quarter. So just wondering if there's any onetime items that we need to think about here as we think about the trends in the fourth quarter.

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

All right. Chris?

Chris Boshoff
Chief Scientific Officer and President of Research & Development

Yes, thanks for the question. So MagnetisMM-5, as you know, double class exposed. Possibly later this year, beginning next year, it's an event-driven study. So timing could shift due to events not happening, which we cannot speculate. But as you can imagine, that's often positive if events are not happening in the study. So we'll just continue to follow the events and hopefully report early next year.

David Denton
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And on the Paxlovid question, I don't think there's any material change in price. We have -- maybe there's different channels mix and things of that nature, but nothing significant from that standpoint.

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Thank you for clarifying, Dave. Let's go to the next question please.

I had a question on your upcoming Phase III EZH2 readout in CRPC. I'm surprised the study is more prominently flagged given the potential to extend the XTANDI franchise. What drives your confidence that you're getting adequate target exposure after examining some of your food effect studies? And also, what's your expectations around overall survival? Could we see a 20% to 30% benefit here?

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Chris, that's for you.

Chris Boshoff
Chief Scientific Officer and President of Research & Development

Thank you very much for the question. This is another first-in-class internally discovered program, EZH2 program. We've previously shared randomized data, which showed significant PFS benefit in all comers in late-line metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. And we now have three Phase III studies ongoing.

The first one will read out, to your point, is post abiraterone metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer, and that we expect in the coming months. We recently also presented data at ASCO, randomized data on the food effect to your question, which was 875 milligrams twice a day with food and show that the data are comparable with the dose we now use in Phase III with reduced GI AE. So we are confident in the dose that was selected.

We'll go next to Kerry Holford with Berenberg.

Kerry Holford
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

Just on the guidance for this year, you've clearly reiterated the total revenue range of $61 to $64, but when you first set that guidance, you spoke of total COVID-19 sales of around $9 billion for the year, seeing that you booked only around just over $4 billion year-to-date. Just interested in your comments on whether that $9 billion is still achievable for the full year? And if not, what other assets would you call out as likely to fill that gap and give you confidence to reiterate the total sales guidance?

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Thank you. Dave, please?

David Denton
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. On the -- you're absolutely right, Kerry, as you pointed out, I would say that to the low end of our guidance range from a revenue perspective would assume that the COVID franchise continues a very modest uptake for the balance of this year, particularly in the U.S. However, as you know, the COVID franchise is subject to peaks and valleys. If there happens to be a wave of COVID in the next several months, you can see utilization spike up.

So that's why the range is so large. I'll just point out that what we have done with an earnings per share guidance range is we've derisked the COVID franchise with the guidance that we provided, given that if the trends continue, we'll be closer to the low end of that range, and we will still be able to deliver on our earnings commitment.

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Thank you, very clear, Dave. Let's move to the next question please.

We'll go next to Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.

Mohit Bansal
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just wanted to understand the thought process around the pricing of the GLP-1 and this class of medicines, given that -- I mean, even today, there's a news article out there suggesting the price could be $150 or so. So it seems like the price is only going in one direction. In that case, I mean, how do you justify the price that you're paying to Metsera and, in general, the obesity landscape over time, how do you think about that with this pricing decline for the class?

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. Thank you. This is also competition that brings prices down. And of course, they try not to restrict competition. But anyway, the -- yes, we -- in our calculations, we have taken into consideration that the prices of GLP-1s probably will start going down. So I don't know what will be announced now. But in our calculations, we took already that into consideration. Thank you, Mohit. Let's go to the next question.

Wolfe Research, LLC

Can you elaborate more on the reason for the delay to the initiation of the pivotal trial for the adult 25-valent pneumococcal program? You had mentioned the caveat of if the FDA aligns with your approach. So the tenor of the dialogue change with the FDA? Is there a chance that surrogate endpoints may no longer be approvable?

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Thank you very much. Chris?

Chris Boshoff
Chief Scientific Officer and President of Research & Development

Yes. Thank you for the question. Across all our vaccine programs, we're obviously working very closely with the FDA and other regulators on the designs of the study and also the endpoint. PCV25, pending positive data and FDA feedback, we -- as mentioned, we intend to start that study as well as the pediatric 25-valent program next year. So it means we will align the pediatric and the adult study. We expect the fourth dose data from the pediatric study early next year.

So that helps us to coordinate the 2 studies. So it will just make it easier. The 25 vaccine candidate covers 25 serotypes, particularly I need to point out serotype 3, which we did before because the vaccine is designed with significantly enhanced immunogenicity against serotype 3, which currently constitutes up to 20% of infections in the U.S. and the EU. And to continue our leadership, we also continue to study our fifth generation with 30-plus serotypes, which we'll update you on more in 2026.

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Thank you, Chris. Operator the next question please.

We'll go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan.

Christopher Schott
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just maybe 2 MFN questions. First one is kind of bigger picture. As you think about MFN on new launches over time, what do you think about this suggesting for international revenues? Is this, I guess, I could read this as a net positive that you can get higher price? I can read as net negative because reimbursement hurdle is going to be tougher at these higher prices, it could be neutral. Just how you kind of envisioned what plays out with international as you signed that deal?

And then the second one is just trying to get a little bit more color on the MFN impact for 2026. I think you mentioned some dilution there, but just any more quantitative metrics you could provide of just like how much of a headwind is that for next year?

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. I'm sorry if I ask Dave to tell you, which he will tell you. We will provide guidance at the end of the year, and that will incorporate everything, including that and the other things that he was talking. So I don't think you will get more words out of our mouth no matter how much you talk to us. But on the new launches in international, of course, we are waiting to see how things may play. The price differential is not sustainable. We are speaking about the smaller basket of countries in international that are affected by that.

And with these countries, we are hoping that they will understand that they need to change the way that they price their products going forward. Of course, a little bit help from the U.S. government and USTR through trade negotiations also can make that happen. And my assessment is that [indiscernible] and the U.S. trade representatives are highly, highly committed to make this go away.

So we will see how that plays. But in theoretical, if the prices over there are -- they are -- we are not agreeing a decent way of pricing our products, clearly, we will not get reimbursement there, and we will price them to the price that will not affect the U.S. price. Thank you. And now let's go to the next question, please.

We'll go next to Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.

Umer Raffat
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

First, on Metsera, I realize this is perhaps in the hands of your M&A lawyers and antitrust lawyers. But from an R&D perspective, can we make sure you'll be evaluating all the new data that's imminent, for example, the monthly transition and how the GI tolerability holds as well as even more importantly, the amylin plus GLP early combo data? And then separately, I was very intrigued by a Phase IIb trial you guys initiated on an oral drug in atopic derm. Could you confirm if it's a STAT6 inhibitor? And were you able to gauge the magnitude of STAT6 inhibition Phase I?

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Look, on the Metsera, it's easy if they provide us data or if they publicize data, of course, we will -- we are eager to see them. And we believe it will be positive. On the second question, I will ask Chris to comment.

Chris Boshoff
Chief Scientific Officer and President of Research & Development

Thank you, Umer, to ask a question regarding our I&I portfolio. I just want to check, are you referring to PF9820?

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

I don't think he can come back in.

Chris Boshoff
Chief Scientific Officer and President of Research & Development

It is, okay. So you are correct. That is a STAT inhibitor. I want to point out that we currently have a very differentiated I&I portfolio with at least 5 molecules in-house discovered and developed, most of these at a significantly accelerated speed, including obviously p40/TL1a, which we co-developed or which is being co-developed with Roche, which covers IL-12 and IL-23 by p40.

Our 2 tri-specifics covering IL-4, IL-13, TSLP or IL-33, both of those now entering Phase II for atopic dermatitis and for other Th2-related diseases. Litfulo with the ongoing and Phase III trial in nonsegmental vitiligo, which is a JAK3/TEC inhibitor, also differentiated in-house. And then the STAT6 early, just entering Phase II could be potentially first-in-class oral. We're currently further optimizing dose and formulation and hope to update you on that program in 2026.

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Thank you very much, next question please.

We'll go next to Steve Scala with TD Cowen.

Steve Scala
TD Cowen, Research Division

Two questions. What does the drug pricing deal with Trump allow Pfizer to do that other companies will not be able to do other than, of course, AstraZeneca? And secondly, on Metsera, so the data looks more similar than different than competitors and Metsera disclosures haven't been completely transparent, raising serious questions.

Many other big cap pharmas have passed over Metsera when pursuing other products, validating the me-too point. Nothing in all this justifies a bidding war or even a protracted legal battle. Is Pfizer's determination to persist underpinned by substantial confidentiality data -- confidential data or simply the desire to be a player in obesity? Or does Pfizer agree with the points that I just said and could it just walk away?

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Thank you, on the first one on the drug prices and what we have that other companies may not have. I can't answer because I don't know what the other companies are having. As you know, the discussions are between the administration and individual companies, which also ensure that there is no antitrust issues. And also, of course, if they are confidential because that's also what the administration and the agreements portray that we should keep confidentiality of those assets.

So I know what we are getting. Some of that has been public and some of that is part of the overall very lengthy deal, but I don't know what others I will take. On the Metsera, look, we have seen the data. We did extensive due diligence, and we priced -- the asset into a price that we thought offers tremendous value to the shareholders of Metsera and to shareholders of Pfizer because those assets that we like in our hands, of course, will provide significant competitive edge.

What you see now, it is a repeat an effort to cut and kill this emerging competitor, which is Pfizer, and to do that by evading the antitrust scrutiny and virtually get control, de facto control of the company as they will become the major shareholder and the major creditor without any regulatory scrutiny. So that's all I have to say. And I'm -- we will see how things go.

Operator

Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO.

Evan Seigerman
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Assuming Metsera closes, what near-term factors must you consider to continue growing the dividend and then delevering, Dave, as you had said, when do you think you may be able to also start to repurchase shares? Or is that less of a priority with all this BD?

David Denton
Executive VP & CFO

Evan, very good question. Obviously, you've seen us over the last 1.5 years or 2 years really lean into productivity across our platform. That productivity has allowed us to delever from roughly 4x to 2.7x. That's given us increased flexibility to do both business development as well as maintain and grow our dividend over time. That cycle of improvement in productivity is something that we've now embedded in the company. We will continue to do that. We will continue to do that across the enterprise. We will continue to prioritize ourselves from an R&D perspective.

Clearly, we have several assets that we think are key to the growth of this company by the end of the decade. We are going to invest behind those assets from a pipeline perspective, and we're going to invest behind the categories of products that we've either acquired and/or recently launched because those will ultimately allow us to offset the LOEs over the next several years. So we'll be able to do all of that. Share repurchases is an important lever for us. In the near term, it's not a tool that we're going to use. We have to get the balance sheet back to where we need to be. And we -- again, we have business priorities that come in the forefront of that at this point. Great question. Thank you.

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Okay. So now I think let's get the last question.

Operator

Our last question comes from Rajesh Kumar with HSBC.

Rajesh Kumar
HSBC Global Investment Research

Two questions, if I may. I appreciate you cannot say a lot about Metsera at this junction. Just from a modeling perspective, if we are thinking of additional balance sheet capacity for dealmaking, how much capacity would you assume -- assuming that you are keeping some capacity away from Metsera at the moment in 2026 on your own internal budgeting, that would be really helpful. And just on the 3SBio, I appreciate the deal has just closed and some of the trials have just started. When can we expect to see data news flow come out of that deal? Is it more a 2027 event? Or do we have any interim readouts or updates in '26?

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Thank you. I think Dave can answer the Metsera modeling?

David Denton
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So as you think about BD capacity, as I said in my prepared remarks, we have approximately $13 billion of capacity as we enter here into the third quarter, so with that...

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Chris, let's understand the [indiscernible].

Chris Boshoff
Chief Scientific Officer and President of Research & Development

Yes, the data flow. So just a reminder, at ASCO 2025, we shared Phase II monotherapy or -- shared Phase II monotherapy data in first-line non-small cell lung cancer showing the overall response -- objective response of 65%. At ESMO, Phase II combo data plus chemotherapy [indiscernible] mFOLFOX6 was shown for first-line metastatic castration -- sorry, metastatic colorectal cancer, and that was showing a response rate of close to 60%.

At SITC, we'll provide additional data, combination data in lung cancer and you've just seen we posted two Phase III programs starting now this year in first-line non-small cell lung cancer and in first-line colorectal cancer. And in the coming weeks, we'll also provide the full development plan to you at event, and that will be -- show the broad -- the breadth and the depth of our clinical development program for 707.

Albert Bourla
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Thank you, Chris. So thank you very much all for your attention. We have been successful in achieving a series of significant strategic milestones. We delivered a solid performance during the quarter, and we are confident in our business, and that's why we are raising the rates of our adjusted diluted EPS. And of course, we maintain our revenue despite the lowest COVID right now trends. So thank you for your interest in Pfizer, and I hope you have a wonderful week.
