Thanks, Ivan. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining SanDisk's fiscal second quarter earnings call. In the quarter, revenue was $3 billion, up 31% sequentially, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.20. Artificial intelligence continues to drive a step change in demand, with data center and edge workloads expanding system complexity and storage content requirements. This shift, along with disciplined commercial actions and strategic capacity allocation, has strengthened our business results. Let me frame the NAND industry's evolution before discussing our end markets. NAND is now recognized as indispensable to the world's storage needs, driving a foundational shift in how commercial relationships between suppliers and customers are structured. Supply certainty, longer planning horizons, and multi-year commitments are increasingly essential to support structural demand that extends beyond the traditional cyclical model of our market.

Asiya Merchant

As a result, we are engaged in discussions with customers to evolve from quarterly negotiations towards multi-year agreements with firmer commitments on supply and pricing, enabling better planning practices and more attractive returns. These changes would better align our planning cycles with customers' demand profiles to our mutual benefit. Accordingly, our supply plans will continue to be designed around predictable, long-term demand at current and forecasted market prices. These dynamics reveal the true value of our NAND technology and reinforce the need for continued innovation and disciplined execution. Our products are enabled by decades of sustained investment in R&D and innovation across NAND and system solutions, supported by substantial capital investments in world-class front-end and back-end manufacturing. As a result, we believe NAND is becoming a more durable, structurally attractive industry with higher average returns.

Turning to our end market highlights, during the quarter, we continue to execute against our roadmap, advancing next-generation product innovations and qualifications across the business, with key customer programs progressing on schedule. In data center, we are at the center of a broad expansion in AI infrastructure. Enterprise SSD demand is accelerating across the ecosystem as AI workloads scale, with inference in particular driving a meaningful increase in NAND content per deployment. This momentum reflects deepening engagement with a wider range of customers building and deploying AI at scale, reshaping our data center business, which we expect to grow meaningfully in both the near and long term. We are seeing strong adoption across all types of AI infrastructure builders, including cloud hyperscalers, edge and enterprise data centers, OEMs, and system integrators deploying AI at scale.

Our technology has become a critical enabler of these deployments, delivering the performance characteristics required for optimized AI infrastructure. The breadth of customer adoption across the AI ecosystem underscores the strength of our technology and the depth of our product portfolio. Within hyperscalers, we have completed qualification of our PCIe Gen 5 high-performance TLC drives at a second hyperscaler, and are on track to complete qualification at additional hyperscalers over the coming quarters, with BiCS8 TLC solutions soon thereafter. This product is driving significant revenue growth across our data center portfolio, which was up 64% sequentially. Our BiCS8 QLC storage class product, code name Stargate, continues advancing through qualification with two major hyperscalers and is expected to begin shipping for revenue within the next several quarters, providing an additional tailwind for data center growth.

In edge, demand meaningfully exceeded supply as replacement cycles in AI adoption across PCs and mobile devices drove richer configurations and higher storage content per device. In this allocation environment, we are partnering with key edge customers to prioritize their mission-critical needs and optimize product mix within our available supply, ensuring the best long-term returns across our portfolio. In consumer, mix shifted toward premium products and higher value configurations, supporting storage content, growth, and profitability. We introduced a breakthrough in the USB form factor with the launch of our SanDisk Extreme Fit, our smallest high-capacity USB-C flash drive. This breakthrough stay-put product gives our customers a seamless and affordable way to significantly expand storage on their PCs and smartphones.

We expanded key licensing initiatives with global household names, Crayola and FIFA, bringing full circle the commitments underscored last February with the debut of colorful SanDisk Crayola USB-C flash drives and officially licensed FIFA World Cup 2026 products. This strong momentum continued through the holidays with demand driven by targeted gaming-led initiatives, including our Don't Delete Your Games campaign. At CES 2026, we introduced the SanDisk Optimus lineup, rebranding WD_BLACK and WD Blue NVMe SSDs to sharpen brand architecture and reinforce performance leadership. Together, these actions reflect our continued focus on driving demand through brand, innovation, and disciplined go-to-market execution, reinforcing SanDisk leadership across gaming, creator, and everyday consumer segments. These wins across our end markets reflect the agility of our operations and the resilience of our broad portfolio.

Looking ahead, we continue to see customer demand well above supply beyond calendar year 2026, which requires careful allocation planning in alignment with our customers. We remain focused on disciplined execution through the BiCS8 transition, supporting average long-term BIT growth in the mid to high teens while maintaining our capital expenditure plan. We are working diligently to support customer demand while ensuring profitability supports the substantial R&D and capital investment required to deliver some of the world's most advanced semiconductor technologies. With that, I'll turn the call over to Luis to dive deeper into our financial performance and guidance.

Luis Visoso

Thank you, David. Before diving into the financials, I will provide a brief market overview. We believe that the NAND market is going through structural evolution catalyzed by AI. The evolution is more pronounced in data center, where data growth is accelerating as the temperature of data is rising, token intensity is accelerating, and storage is a critical enabler for inference. As a result, NAND is an increasingly critical component of the AI infrastructure. Higher demand for NAND in data center impacts other markets, which are also growing as NAND flows to the most attractive markets. It is our view that this structural evolution is sustainable and should reduce the cyclicality of our NAND business, creating higher average long-term margins and returns. In the December quarter, we experienced a clear and significant improvement in market conditions across end markets, which led to higher pricing.

Asiya Merchant

During the quarter, we made strategic allocation decisions as demand for our products continues to exceed supply. The framework we use to allocate bits is to maximize value creation. We prioritize supply for our strategic customers, those who recognize the value we can create together. These are the customers with whom we intend to build valuable partnerships, thus establishing sustainable multi-year business practices with high predictability of demand, returns, and capital deployment. Given the strength of the market, we were unable to fulfill demand for our customers this quarter. We're evolving how we define strategic engagement, prioritizing customers with multi-year supply frameworks and share planning commitments over transactional short-term demand signals. We continue to be prudent and are not changing our capital spending plans, which support mid- to high-teens bit growth through the BiCS8 transition. Our investment posture remains focused on serving attractive, sustained demand at healthy profitability levels.

Any material increase in capital deployment would require high confidence that demand at attractive pricing levels is durable over a several-year horizon with financial commitments. In the current environment, we're committed to supplying our three end markets as we believe that diversification maximizes value creation. We plan to continue to build strategic relationships with a diversified customer mix within these markets, allowing us to have a deeper understanding of their long-term needs. In the quarter, we continue to make progress with customers in establishing share commitments that improve the predictability of the business. Customer commitments and agreed commercial terms are the most effective mechanism to deliver supply certainty and return on invested capital predictability, allowing us to more prudently manage our capital-intensive business across geographies. With that context, I will dive deeper into the quarter results.

Revenue for the second quarter was $3,025 million, up 31% quarter-over-quarter and 61% year-over-year. This compares favorably to our guidance of $2,550 million-$2,650 million. The revenue over delivery came from higher prices across segments, which strengthened during the quarter. Bits were up 22% year-over-year and low single digits quarter-over-quarter. In the second quarter, we saw strong sequential demand across all end markets. Edge revenue came in at $1,678 million, up 21% sequentially. Consumer came in at $907 million, up 39% quarter-over-quarter, and data center came in at $440 million, up 64% sequentially. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter was 51.1%, up from 29.9% in the prior quarter. This compares favorably to our guidance of 41%-43%. The gross margin over delivery came from higher pricing. Unit cost reductions came in as expected, reinforcing margin improvements.

In the second quarter, we incurred $24 million in startup cost. Excluding this cost, non-GAAP gross margin would have been 51.9%. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter were $413 million and represent 13.7% of revenue. This compares favorably to our guidance range of $450 million-$475 million, reflecting a non-recurring benefit from changing how we manage new product introductions. As a result, non-GAAP operating margins at 37.5% are up from 10.6% in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter was $6.20, up from $1.22 in the prior quarter. This compares favorably to our guidance range of $3.00-$3.40. The non-GAAP EPS beat reflects higher than expected revenue and lower costs. Key GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation items include $52 million in stock-based compensation net of taxes, which represents 1.7% of revenue, and $93 million related to certain legal matters.

Moving on to the balance sheet, we closed the quarter with $1,539 million in cash and cash equivalents and $603 million in debt. During the quarter, we paid an additional $750 million of debt and closed the quarter with a net cash position of $936 million. Moving on to free cash flow, during the quarter, we generated $843 million in adjusted free cash flow, which represents a 27.9% free cash flow margin. This includes $1,019 million from operations, partially offset by $176 million from net cash capital spending. Our gross capital spending totaled $255 million and represents 8.4% of revenue. Earlier today, we announced that we have reached an agreement with Kioxia to extend the Yokkaichi joint venture through December 31st, 2034. With this extension, the Yokkaichi and Kitakami JVs will have the same expiration date.

Building on more than 25 years of partnership, we believe that the JV reflects the scale of our operations and the significant mutual value created over time. The JV enables both companies to design and manufacture the highest performing, lowest cost NAND technology that powers the world's infrastructure. As part of this extension, SanDisk is agreed to pay for the manufacturing services that Kioxia will provide, enabling continued availability of product supply, a total of $1,165 million. This amount will be paid between calendar year 2026 and calendar year 2029. The cost will flow through our cost of goods sold over the next nine years. Moving on to guidance. For the third quarter, we expect revenue between $4.4 billion-$4.8 billion. We anticipate the market to be more undersupplied than it was in the second quarter.

We expect bits to be down mid-single digits due to a lower than historical seasonality as we benefit from accelerating strength in data center. Our forecast for non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter is between 65% and 67%. For the third quarter, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses between $450 million and $470 million. We expect non-GAAP interest and other expenses between $25 million and $30 million and non-GAAP tax expenses between $325 and $375 million. We forecast non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter between $12 and $14, assuming 157 million fully diluted shares. With that, let me turn the call back to David.

David Goeckeler

Thank you, Luis. In summary, we continue to successfully navigate these early stages of a far-reaching evolution in our business. In addition to its central role in technology we use every day, PCs, smartphones, tablets, the cloud, cars, gaming devices, robotics, and on and on, NAND is a critical technology enabling the development and proliferation of artificial intelligence. For the first time, data center is expected to become the largest market for NAND in 2026, driven by some of the world's largest and well-capitalized technology companies. Fueled by the performance our technology delivers, customers across all our end markets are increasingly seeking business practices built around shared commitments and agreed financially attractive terms aligned with our pre-existing supply plans. Our supply plans will remain aligned to such attractive, real, and sustainable long-term demand.

Asiya Merchant

With this backdrop, margins are expected to reset at a structurally higher level, delivering fair returns on the substantial innovation and investment required. Our technology and product portfolios intersect these changing market dynamics at the perfect moment, positioning us to manage a balanced portfolio and deliver industry-leading financial performance. With that, let's open up for questions.
