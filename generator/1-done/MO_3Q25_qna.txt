Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions]. We will take questions from the investment community first. Our first question comes from Matt Smith with Stifel.

Matthew Smith
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Sal, you raised the low end of the guidance again, which is nice to see here, but the fourth quarter implies a deceleration in the earnings growth. You called out lapping the share repurchase and the MSA legal fee expiration. Are there any other key puts and takes as we think about the fourth quarter and more importantly, the path to growing smokeable OCI again?

Salvatore Mancuso
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Matt. No, as you mentioned, we did talk about the share repurchase and the MSA legal funnel. I'll also say we continue to monitor consumer spending, the marketplace remains dynamic. So I would really focus on that, but we feel really good about the ability to narrow guidance by raising the bottom. We're very pleased with the first 9-month financial performance.

And then smokable profitability, again, we feel really good about PM USA's performance, their ability to expand margins for Marlboro remains strong within the premium segment. So we feel really good about the smokable business and happy to be able to provide the guidance.

Matthew Smith
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

And as a follow-up, you called out the underlying cigarette industry rate of decline moderating on a sequential basis. Billy, I know you provide the 12-month bridge that shows the macroeconomic factor. But with -- sometimes that 12-month bridge can not move as much on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So when we think about the moderation that we saw sequentially, can you talk about the drivers that you think are leading to that?

William Gifford
CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks for the question, Matt. I think when you step back and look at it, you're right, the 12-month doesn't move quite as quickly. I think what you're seeing in the marketplace -- and look, our consumer is still under pressure. Again, they don't need improvement. They just need consistency. And we've seen a bit of consistency around gas prices, inflation, things of that nature, and we'll see how that continues through the year.

And I think we're starting to see some of the -- and I talked about it in my remarks, some of the stepped-up enforcement in e-vapor, it puts consumers back at play. We would love to be able to keep them in the smokeless category, but when enforcement happens, it certainly puts them at play and they consider other nicotine categories.

And we'll take our next question from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.

Bonnie Herzog
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

All right. I guess I have a question first on the nicotine pouch category. The competitive environment has really intensified. So could you touch on what you're seeing and whether I guess you've been happy with the performance and positioning of on! considering the moderating growth. And then could you talk about some of your initiatives that you're implementing, I guess, to maybe turn the performance around. I guess I'm kind of wondering, do you feel that you need to step up promotional spend.

And then finally, could you maybe share early feedback on the rollout of on! PLUS and I guess, assuming it's positive, should we assume you'll roll out that brand nationally.

William Gifford
CEO & Director

Yes, thanks for the question, Bonnie. You're right. The competitive environment significantly stepped. I mean when we try to dimensionalize it on! was moving up, call it, 1.5% at retail from a price perspective. while the entire category was down 7% on a national basis, but as much as 70% in a major retail.

So it was a significant shift in promotional spending by competitors. We had that early on with the on! in the marketplace when we launched, and we've talked about how we're bringing the revenue growth management tools over to the category. So we're extremely pleased with the performance where we were moving up in retail price and the category was moving down significantly.

I know people get hung up on some of the shipment volume. I think the encouraging aspect that we see is on the retail takeaway volume. And when you look at that, that's the true demand by the consumer, and that was steady even in that highly competitive environment. Much too early on on! PLUS to really mention, we are certainly excited about the differentiation that product has and research, and we're excited to be able to bring that to market and expand it when it's appropriate.

Bonnie Herzog
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

All right. And then I just wanted to also ask about your KT&G partnership, it was recently expanded and you touched on this, but just hoping for a little more color on the operational efficiencies you see, especially as it relates to opportunities to maybe take advantage of the double duty drawback.

Also, could you give us a little more color on I guess, opportunities for alternative revenue streams as well as further expansion internationally given this partnership?

William Gifford
CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Bonnie. And you touched on 2 of the 3. We really see it as 3-pronged. Certainly, the modern oral initiative, being able to expand on! and on! PLUS in international markets is something that we'll be exploring. Rounding out our portfolio with the inclusion of LOOP into that, so we feel like that completes the portfolio, and we look forward to continuing discussions with them on how to think about expanding internationally into other markets.

The second point is certainly the non-nicotine opportunities. And I tried to highlight a little bit where we would explore working with them. They have certainly the product expertise in the Korean red ginseng and we would look to work with them based on our commercial distribution strength in the U.S. of what are the opportunities there and certainly, we'll share more when it's appropriate.

And the third was the operational efficiencies. And what we saw there was it was the ability to adapt our manufacturing center for cigarettes for items that are specific to international markets, whether that be pack size or trace and tracking and things of that nature. It certainly, to your point, allows us to take advantage of duty drawback. That's a benefit of it. But it also opens up the door for us to think about international opportunities in the future.

[Operator Instructions]. We'll go next to Eric Serotta with Morgan Stanley.

Eric Serotta
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Billy, starting on on! PLUS, I realize it's very early days, but you did mention it as premium positioning. Could you talk a bit about the price point as you launch in the 3 states where you did a realizing only a matter of weeks or less. But how are you thinking about the relative price point of on! PLUS relative to on! and relative to competitors, which I realize are moving target at the moment.

And then Sal, controllable costs and smokables were up pretty significantly year-on-year, I realize they were down in a year ago. So there was perhaps a comparison issue. But how are you thinking about controllable costs going forward? Or is there any additional color you could talk about in the quarter? And the smokeable OCI growth was relatively muted at less than 1%. Was that really the controllable cost, or are there other factors that you'd point to that constrain the OCI growth in the quarter?

William Gifford
CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Eric. So I'll kick this off and then Sal can follow up with the question for him. I think when you think about on! PLUS, we certainly see that as a premium-priced product because of the differentiation and the satisfaction we think it brings in the experience to the consumer. In our research, the consumers choose that as the top product in there from a total experience standpoint, and we think it can demand the premium price at retail.

Certainly, in any introduction, you have introductory price promotions. We know as soon as we get it in consumers' hands, they experience that differentiation that I'm trying to highlight to you. And so we'll certainly have introductory price promotions as we look to expand when appropriate.

Salvatore Mancuso
Executive VP & CFO

As far as controllable costs go, I guess I'd start by saying that I would not look at controllable costs quarter-by-quarter. I think -- I really believe you need to look at the cost over the long term exactly for the reasons you highlighted in the question. There are some comparison issues.

Costs are not linear. There's timing within a quarter. So you touched on that in the question. I think you are right to point that out. As far as controllable costs going forward, I'm going to be careful not to kind of lean into future guidance and things like that. But I would tell you how we think about costs. Obviously, in a declining category like smokeable and cigarettes in particular, cost management is an important part of the growth algorithm along with pricing. We do manage our overall costs.

Obviously, we've shared with you the Optimize and Accelerate program that, that program is not just about effective cost management and cost reductions. It's also about better performance and speed to market. And we are taking those cost savings and reinvesting that in our future.

I'll also share that we spend a lot of time continuing to hone our data analytics in our revenue growth management tools, and that has been extremely helpful. And while it manifests itself as price realization in the P&L, I look at that as productivity because we are better able to use promotional investments to support our brands and PM USA and data analytics team continue to do a terrific job of using data analytics and those RGM tools extremely effectively. So we're very happy about that.

And then OCI for smokeable, I really would look at that over a longer term, again, not a particular quarter smokable is up 2.5% on a year-to-date basis. Very pleased with its performance, especially when you see the strength of Marlboro within the premium segment.

We'll go next to Faham Baig with UBS.

Mirza Faham Baig
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

A couple from me as well. Firstly, if I could come back on the duty drawbacks. If we take a bigger look at the at the picture. Altria is likely to make around $3 million in federal excise tax payments this year. Should this be the amount that we think about the potential benefit from the duty drawbacks. And is this likely to be the sort of key engine that drives group EPS growth to high single digits over the next couple of years to meet the mid-single-digit EPS CAGR to 2028. So that's the first question.

The second one, going back to the pilot program that the FDA is running. Does this or could this impact your decision to go ahead with the national launch on on! PLUS, i.e., you may wait for the decision on this? Or you may take a decision irrespective of the program?

And the second one on that is why do you think it's possible for the FDA to accelerate this process on nicotine pouches, but it's not possible to do so in vapor, which is arguably a much larger category and reviews there began much earlier.

William Gifford
CEO & Director

Yes. So quite a few things in that question. So if I don't touch on one, please follow up. I think when you think about the duty drawback, I wouldn't jump to a conclusion at this point in time. It's really about a relationship with international players. How do we think about producing cigarettes for international, some of the other benefits that we get certainly drawback is an additional benefit to that.

When you think about the pilot program, I want to be clear that we want a functioning regulatory system. So we're going to always make our decisions based on what's the long-term best interest of the company with an eye towards what is best to get a functioning regulatory system. I think your question related to pouches versus vapor, I think from comments from them, but just the interpretation of it being called a pilot program, they wanted to start where it made sense to start, and that's in nicotine pouch.

It's a fairly set category, even though we've seen some players maybe enter the marketplace illicitly. It gives them a way to thinking about the category in total and then differentiated products and what's different between individual products in the marketplace, which should speed up their review of that.

I think when you think about vapor, the marketplace is a mess right now. And so I think the nature of a pilot program is to learn. They will learn manufacturers, including us, will learn. It's been a very collaborative process with constant engagement through the application review process, which is very different and very encouraging from the FDA we experienced under the previous administration.

So I think once you have those learnings, we would hope and encourage the FDA to expand it to other categories.

Mirza Faham Baig
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I guess just a quick follow-up. Could you clarify that the EPS growth is suggested to accelerate to high single digits over the next couple of years in order to meet your mid-single-digit EPS CAGR. Is that still the ambition?

William Gifford
CEO & Director

Our ambition is the goal. We haven't changed our goals from an overall CAGR that we stated previously. And that's been our stated goal. So yes, that's the way I would think about how we're going to manage the business going forward.
