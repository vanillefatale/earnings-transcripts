Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to David Begleiter at Deutsche Bank.

David Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Could you address again the volume decline you're forecasting in highway deicing and whether that's a structural decline or maybe some sort of cyclical decline? Or how do you look at that number going forward?

Ben Nichols
Chief Commercial Officer

David, this is Ben. I appreciate the question. I think 2 things to note. One is our commitment levels year-over-year were slightly up, which we had communicated previously. The reason you're seeing a decline in the forecasted sales volume is it's just a reversion to more typical winter assumptions. The prior winter operated at, call it, 95-plus percent of commitment levels. And our guidance moving forward is just a move back to more typical weather.

David Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Understood. In terms of the full year guidance range, what are the drivers do you think to get to the upper and lower end of that guidance, EBITDA band?

Ben Nichols
Chief Commercial Officer

Yes, David, Ben again. I think the primary driver would be upside in winter weather. That's going to be the biggest impact to getting to the upper end of the guidance. And then obviously, any efficiencies that come with better market demand.

Edward Dowling
President, CEO & Director

And I would add -- David, this is Ed. I would add consistent operations and success with our improvement efforts that are ongoing at the different mines.

We'll move next to Jeff Zekauskas at JPMorgan.

Jeffrey Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Given that you expect your volumes as a base case to be lower in both segments year-over-year, does that mean that your inventories are unlikely to grow next year?

Peter Fjellman
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, this is Peter. So we continue to align our inventories and our production levels. to meet those demands and that range of demand.

Edward Dowling
President, CEO & Director

Yes, this is Ed, we'll comfortably continue to manage our inventory in the company. Our objective is to use cash and retire debt. And we'll ensure that we maintain the proper level of inventory as we proceed along that path over the course of the year. So we're not planning on building inventory over and above kind of where we are. Does that answer that?

Jeffrey Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

To put it a different way, do you expect to use working capital in 2026 or not?

Ben Nichols
Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. So I think the -- Jeff, this is Ben. And I think the way to think about it is there's time frames within our core business. One is the inventory that you're carrying through this season. And so as we think about our inventory profile through this season, call it, end of March, we feel pretty confident that we're fully aligned to our sales forecast. At that point, we'll make the decision as to how the winter informs the next season. and we will adjust our production planning and inventory strategy accordingly. So that's how I would think about it.

Jeffrey Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And then in Plant Nutrition, why were volumes pulled forward? And how much of your volumes do you think were pulled forward?

Ben Nichols
Chief Commercial Officer

Yes, Jeff, this is Ben. The exact number would be hard to pin down. Really, it was just a function of the way the market behaves. And luckily, we were in a good place at Ogden from a production stability standpoint, we had the inventory in place to go ahead and serve the business and monetize in fiscal '25. So it was a significant portion of the delta between the year-over-year variance, but I wouldn't give you an exact number.

Jeffrey Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Were there onetime benefits in the fourth quarter in that your year-over-year, your projection for EBITDA next year is really no different than what you earned in '25, and you had obviously a very, very strong second half. Why are you making more in Plant Nutrition next year, as a base case?

Ben Nichols
Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. Primarily, it's going to be the price upside you see in the P&L.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And at this time, we have no further questions. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ed Dowling for closing remarks.

Edward Dowling
President, CEO & Director
