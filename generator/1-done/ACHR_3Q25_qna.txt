Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Edison Yu with Deutsche Bank.

Xin Yu
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I want to ask about the big news on the airport. What kind of advantages do you think you will gain by taking ownership of it? And does this signal kind of some intention on what you might do from a software standpoint on air traffic control on autonomy?

Adam Goldstein
Founder, CEO & Chairman

So this was a very unique opportunity. Airports don't really change hands very often, sometimes not at all. If you look back over the past 5 years, there are only a handful of assets that have traded in the entire U.S. So opportunities like this are, I think, very rare.

Now you know our big strategy has been focused around Los Angeles, especially with the Olympics coming up. And so as we've been building out the infrastructure, Hawthorne was a real opportunity to not only just be a major hub, but also to be a point where we can go test, roll out, do all of our [indiscernible], all of our MRO at. And so our vision is to create this Grand Central like opportunity for the Hawthorne Airport.

We looked at it as you can go out and buy a hangar. We would have had to pay somewhere between $50 million to $100 million to buy a large hangar. And so the opportunity to actually get control of the airport plus the FBO, plus all the different growth opportunities was something that we couldn't pass up.

But I think most unique is the opportunity to actually go roll out our software in an airport that's in the middle of a large city. So the Hawthorne Airport operates in Class D airspace, not in the Class B airspace, where big LAX planes are operating.

There is an FAA contracted tower here. And so it gives us a really unique opportunity to really roll this stuff out. It's more than just looking at it from a revenue or EBITDA perspective. It is structurally advantageous for us to have this right in the middle of L.A.

It also happens to be less than 3 miles from both LAX and SoFi Stadium. It also happens to be located all in the different Elon Musk company territories like the Boeing Company. The Boring Company has tunnels that run underneath the airport. And so lots of interesting creative opportunity potential in the future.

Xin Yu
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Understood. Understood. And then I know you mentioned that it's already quite profitable. Any way to kind of mention the contribution financially from them going forward?

Adam Goldstein
Founder, CEO & Chairman

The revenue has the opportunity to be in the tens of millions and it is EBITDA positive. But we don't really think about it like that because there's some decisions that we have to think about.

So one is do we sell hangars? Do we build new hangars? Do we lease new hangars? Or do we consume them ourselves? And so there's a bunch of decisions that have to get made in terms of how we will utilize the airport, but we look at it mostly from a strategic standpoint.

I think if we wanted to, we could carve out the airport and make money, but that's certainly not the goal. The goal is really to take it as a strategic asset and use it to have a structural advantage in the industry.

Xin Yu
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Got you. And just on the raise, I know you're using some of it to -- for the deal, but it seems like the deal is fairly small in size. So you actually raised quite a bit more. Any insight as to, I guess, what that -- what the extra was for?

Adam Goldstein
Founder, CEO & Chairman

Yes. It was opportunistic. We weren't looking to go out there and raise capital. There was a very large reverse inquiry from very high-quality investors. So that was, I think, unique for this period of time.

I'm guessing a lot of that came off the back of the beta IPO because there's a lot of interest in the industry and I view that as just a very positive signal. So I think that was one thing.

The strategic asset was also a really unique thing that came up as well to go do that. So the viewpoint was we have been looking at both the civil and the defense side of the business.

As the civil side of the business starts to approach getting close to market and the defense side of the business starting to ramp up, we thought it would be prudent to add a little bit of extra cushion to the balance sheet.

And then finally, from an offense perspective, we have found that the capital has been a real weapon in terms of going out and being able to do things that we might not have been able to do. For example, the Lilium portfolio.

We were actually the lowest bid when it came to the different bids that were out there, but there was a lot of confidence in our ability to close and we ended up winning that because there have been previously some issues that the bankruptcy group had been through before.

Also going to customers like the big defense partners, when we show up with a large balance sheet, they take us a lot more seriously because the programs that we're looking at are so large, they look at us and say, if we're going to go get you guys involved in a many tens of billions of dollar sized program that's going to last for, they call them generational programs, you need to go deliver against that.

And so it puts us in a position of strength to do that. So while this was opportunistic, I think we are done raising capital for a while for now.

Our next question comes from the line of Andres Sheppard with Cantor Fitzgerald.

Andres Sheppard-Slinger
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

Andres here. Congrats on the quarter. Adam, I was wondering if you could maybe help us flush out your latest vision for commercialization in the UAE and through your Launch Edition. Just wondering if you can maybe remind us timing or expectations there? Are you looking to sell aircraft in the region? Just a little more color on your vision there for commercialization.

Adam Goldstein
Founder, CEO & Chairman

So we kicked off our Launch Edition program in the UAE this summer and we delivered an aircraft and began test flights in Abu Dhabi and we did that in partnership with our partner out there, Abu Dhabi Aviation.

And as a reminder, each of the Launch Edition programs carry a multiyear commercial value in the tens of millions of dollars to Archer. And so we've already started receiving initial cash payments in the 7-figure range tied to operational milestones.

And then beginning in 2026, we expect to recognize payments as revenue under the accounting treatment for the program takes place. And then just this week, we saw the Director General of the UAE's National Aviation Regulator reaffirm publicly that they remain on track for certification as early as Q3 '26.

So that would enable our partner, Abu Dhabi Aviation to begin commercial passenger service in the country once that takes place.

But as a reminder, we sell aircraft. As we sell aircraft, we start to recognize revenue and collect cash. So we have the ability to do that really all over the world, as you've seen with our Launch Edition partners.

So right now what we're doing is balancing the volume of aircraft we're building against testing in the U.S., the eIPP program and the Launch Edition customers. So there's certainly lots of opportunities to do all 3.

Andres Sheppard-Slinger
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

Got it. That's super helpful. I appreciate that color. And revenues next year, that's exciting. Maybe as a follow-up, I was wondering if you could -- either you or Tom can maybe expand a little bit further on the defense side and maybe on the hybrid propulsion.

What kind of opportunities there are you able to share with us that you might be pursuing, whether it's with Anduril or other partners there? Just another maybe update on the defense side.

Adam Goldstein
Founder, CEO & Chairman

Sure. So we are deep in the process of product development with Anduril and we've been working closely with the customer on building for specific missions. What's become very clear as we've gone through this process is that you cannot just take a hybrid powertrain and put it onto an existing eVTOL platform. The defense industry is not interested in that as a product.

There are specific missions that need to be filled. And so we're building a platform that is reusing as many of our systems, subsystems, manufacturing processes as possible. And if we're selected for that program, I think it will change the game for vertical lift warfare.

And so when we have something to show, we will -- we'll show everybody. But if you look at the size of past rotorcraft programs, they are absolutely massive and they last for decades.

So we continue to be very excited, engaged in that. We continue to be very positive that good opportunities will come. And so that's largely where the defense opportunity, we think, sits.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James.

Savanthi Syth
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Adam, I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about the kind of the eIPP program. Just curious what the thinking or the strategy is behind it for the DOT and how you think it's going to work.

Adam Goldstein
Founder, CEO & Chairman

Sure. So there's been a lot of speculation about the eIPP and it really is still forming. But the purpose of the eIPP is not really about generating revenue. It's actually about introducing aircraft into urban environments and gaining the trust of the flying public, gaining the trust of municipalities and regulators.

And so the program will roll out conservatively, simple point-to-point routes in good weather, VFR conditions. And the goal is really to prove the safety and capability of the aircraft.

We all know the type certification process is sort of an all or nothing type process. And while I understand the purpose of that, I believe the way that autonomous cars or Waymos have been rolled out makes actually a lot of sense.

You start in a small area, you gain the trust of the public and then you start to expand. And I think by having a process like this, it will release the certification pressure valve and it should accelerate the path towards certification and commercialization.

Savanthi Syth
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. And if I can just follow up briefly on the -- I think in the 8-K release, it was kind of called out that $171 million for Hawthorne. It seems like the purchase price is $126 million.

I'm kind of curious what the spend -- the near-term spend you see at Hawthorne and kind of what that incremental spend there is and just kind of how you think about spend over the next kind of year or 2?

Adam Goldstein
Founder, CEO & Chairman

Sure. So there is the core price, which is the $126 million for the airport, there are development rights and then there's the FBO and that adds up to the $171 million. There's decisions that we can make in terms of how much to spend, but there's not some like big giant number that we're going to go deploy into the -- that's expected for us to go deploy into the airport in the near term.

And so we'll look at that in terms of the value that can be created, the operations that we need to scale L.A. and scale into the Olympics. But those are still decisions to be made, but I would not expect some giant dollar number.

I also would not expect us to go try to replicate this all over the country or over the world. These opportunities don't even really exist. This is like an end of one asset. And so it is pretty unique from that standpoint.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Bill Peterson with JPMorgan.

Mahima Kakani
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

This is Mahima on for Bill. I was hoping to follow up a little bit on certification. Would you be able to share your latest expectations around when you expect to begin TIA testing and when you also expect to be testing Midnight with FAA pilots on board for credit?

Thomas Muniz
Chief Technology Officer

This is Tom. I'll answer that. So we're actually getting pretty close to starting our first TIA campaign with the FAA and that could happen as soon as the end of this year. Just to kind of level set everybody, as I said in the past, the TIA process, at least for us, will be broken into many phases on the order of, say, 10 different TIAs, each one targeting compliance for a very specific system or aspect of the aircraft. So the first one of those, again, we plan to start around the end of the year.

And the way you could think about the evolution here is as we continue to deliver or finish manufacturing of these aircraft, each one will be built with systems and aspects that conform in order to support further TIA testing, ultimately building up to a final fully FAA-conformed aircraft doing kind of the final F&R function reliability testing for the aircraft.

I think one thing that's important to know is that right now, as we said before, we still do have a couple of policy items open with the FAA. And so us or anybody in the industry can't do that final TIA for the purposes of flight performance until a couple of those items are resolved.

And we're still optimistic that that will happen very shortly. Otherwise, progress is looking really good.

Mahima Kakani
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Awesome. And then as you kind of ramp up your manufacturing capacity here, I think you mentioned up to 50 aircrafts in the coming months. Do you think that that's sufficient to support all the demand that you see in the next year between the test aircraft, the eIPP defense and then some of your international Launch Edition programs?

Adam Goldstein
Founder, CEO & Chairman

This is Adam. The demand far exceeds what we can build. And so we're really in the phase where we kind of broke this out into chunks. We said we built that first chunk of, call it, single digit aircrafts and then we're looking at that next chunk, which is in the 50-aircraft range.

And so we're looking at from the standpoint of making sure we can have enough aircraft to support the different opportunities we have coming, whether that's the Launch Edition programs or looking ahead and supporting the Olympics and really trying to think about where the near-term opportunities will be.

But if we theoretically had hundreds of airplanes, I think we could deploy them, sell them, put them out there. But I also think we are learning how to build. And so there's different chunks that we're going through as we scale that up.

And we're also, of course, finishing up and getting through the certification process in the U.S. and then, of course, internationally as well.

So it's a balance amongst all of those, but I think it really starts with there's a high-level demand for the product and then it's us being able to deliver against that from a manufacturing and then ultimately certification.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Austin Moeller with Canaccord.

Austin Moeller
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

So I just wanted to ask about the Lilium asset acquisition. Is Lilium silicon-dominant anode battery or the ducted fan technology more important to you? And when might this be incorporated into one of your aircraft platforms?

Adam Goldstein
Founder, CEO & Chairman

So we've been following Lilium closely for several years and we have a lot of respect for the engineering ambition that Daniel and his team brought to the sector. And they built very impressive technology with world-class European talent and they invested $1.5 billion behind it.

And so our consolidation of the innovation by winning that bid for us was, I think, actually quite positive and that there were a number of foundational eVTOL technologies around ducted fan, propeller systems, high-voltage systems and many others that we were able to accumulate patents on.

So it adds around 300 patents -- patent assets to the Archer portfolio, bringing our portfolio to more than 1,000 patent assets globally. But much of the technology that was being developed there, we believe was still a little bit ahead of its time, but it holds meaningful potential as the industry matures.

And so the depth of the ducted fan IP, we think, is quite compelling. We're laser-focused on Midnight, but that technology one day could support new architectures, including some of the smaller format or light sport concepts, as the regulatory pathways from MOSAIC unlocks innovation in those adjacent segments.

So we view this as a very important long-term enabler and just another example of us consolidating the technology foundation of the industry.

Austin Moeller
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

Okay. And just on the purchase of the Hawthorne Airport, I think when we were in your office, we discussed the importance of real estate at airports for eVTOL. So are you planning to transfer any of the space at those airports either to FBOs or airline customers to be able to use? Or how are you thinking about using that valuable real estate?

Adam Goldstein
Founder, CEO & Chairman

So the airport is quite large. It's 80 acres. And so we have partners in the industry like Beta, who come and electrify airports. And there's groups out there that we partner with that I think could also find value in the airport. So there's lots of ways to think about it.

One is we can build a centralized hub that everybody can use. And so it could be a way to help bring the industry together and create a main point of interest for us all to use to really help unlock a city like Los Angeles. And so I think that's one really attractive way to look at it.

Another one is as the industry matures, it gives us a real central hub for all the maintenance, for all the [indiscernible] of aircraft in the middle of the city. So when you think about like launching operations, you don't really want to fly your aircraft in 30 minutes, 45 minutes from somewhere significantly outside the city.

So this was just super unique from that standpoint that we could use that. But I think it's an opportunity to really help the industry propel forward in a complicated city.

And then this other side of it is it gives us an incredible opportunity to go out and test out all the software, the AI capabilities that we've been building from air traffic management to all the other capabilities we mentioned.

The industry is going to need to evolve to support the large advanced air mobility expectations. And so that's not just on manufacturing. That also has to come from the software side as well. And so we plan to use this airport as a testbed to deploy that, partnering with the regulators to really showcase a lot of these technologies.

Our next question comes from the line of Amit Dayal with H.C. Wainwright.

Amit Dayal
H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division

Congrats on all the progress. I apologize if you already discussed this, but any color on the burn rate for 2026?

Priya Gupta
Acting CFO, Acting Principal Financial Officer & VP of Finance

Yes. Amit, this is Priya. So when we think about 2026, the biggest expense will continue to be our Midnight program. So next year, we'll be producing and deploying additional aircraft.

As we've talked about earlier, we'll balance where we deploy these aircraft between UAE, eIPP, flight test and other opportunities. Some of those opportunities will be generating cash and they'll net these expenses we've talked about.

But when we think about beyond this core program, we expect to invest in our defense and software development as well. So first, for the defense program, we do plan to leverage a large portion of the existing resources we have as well as the test infrastructure.

But we do expect to invest incrementally to support the program, which again locks a lot of the value and big defense contracts that Adam has talked about.

For software, we'll be, again, investing to build the product, which could generate revenues in the future. Timing of that is still to be determined and we'll talk about it closer to the time when we get there.

And then, of course, finally, we talked about the Hawthorne acquisition today. We'll be integrating that into our business next year, which is, again, generating revenues and will be generating margins. So we'll be incorporating that into our financial results for next year.

So again, hopefully, that gives you again a framework as and how we think about next year and we'll get into official guidance when we get to that point in time next quarter. So hopefully, that helps.

Amit Dayal
H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division

That's helpful. And then just a clarification on the number of aircrafts you may need to get through certification and commitments in UAE, et cetera. Like are we targeting around 10 aircrafts over the next 6 to 9 months?

Thomas Muniz
Chief Technology Officer

Yes. So there's 6 aircraft in production now with parts on order for many more than that. But as Priya mentioned, we're sort of trying to judge or be opportunistic with where to use those aircrafts. So certainly, there's a planned portion of those at least that will be used for FAA certification testing.

But others, we want to send to eIPP locations in order to support that testing as well as our activities in the UAE. So until all those things start to materialize, we have optionality for kind of how many to send to which location.

Amit Dayal
H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division

Understood. And just last question, Adam. This is an interesting acquisition of this airport, strategic asset for you guys. Do you think this sort of triggers a little bit of a land grab in terms of other sort of players or even direct participants trying to get involved in taking ownership of such assets, given they are limited in number and some of these could be in critical locations that could support expansion efforts in the long term? Like how should we think about some of these types of assets that are adjacent to the story that now kind of comes to the fore after this deal that you've undertaken?

Adam Goldstein
Founder, CEO & Chairman

I think that some of the competitors would be interested in doing that. I just don't think there are opportunities to do that. These assets just change hands so rarely and sometimes never because they're owned by municipalities.

So they're very unique in nature when they come up. Again, we plan to use this asset as a hub for Los Angeles and to really build around it and we welcome the competitors to actually use it and to kind of unify more as an industry to together help operationalize an incredible city of Los Angeles, which can have a huge opportunity and there will be plenty of room for us all to help change the urban landscape here.

Our next question comes from the line of David Zazula with Barclays.

David Zazula
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I guess, first, on the Launch Edition aircraft, I know you're -- there's not that much you can say, but is there -- are there any modifications that you anticipate to be able to use the currently flying Launch Edition aircraft as the conforming aircraft forecasting with [indiscernible]?

Thomas Muniz
Chief Technology Officer

With regards to the certification in UAE, which was with the GCAA, as I've talked about in past calls, we've got a very detailed kind of step-by-step plan for delivering data to them to support the kind of phased integration of the aircraft and ultimately getting to passenger service in that country.

A lot of that is leveraging testing we've already done or already doing with the FAA. And from there, it kind of tees into the discussion we had earlier around TIA.

And so I would just go back to our framework there of each aircraft we're building is really targeted to generate specific data to provide to regulators, both in the UAE and the U.S. in order to show compliance.

So again, that kind of merged with trying to, let's say, balance where we put our priorities as far as allocating aircrafts. We've got essentially like a lot of past, but they all lead to really exciting things for next year.

David Zazula
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Very helpful. And then Tom, could you maybe give a little more color on any impact that the shutdown has had on the certification time line and the ability to progress towards the confirming aircraft in the U.S.?

Thomas Muniz
Chief Technology Officer

Yes, absolutely. I touched on it briefly earlier on the call, but we are still engaging with the FAA despite the shutdown. So on our program, some resources continue to work, which is fantastic.

Others are unfortunately not available. So hopefully, that situation gets resolved soon. But in several areas, we're sort of unconstrained just continuing to execute all the areas that have approved cert plans and we're just in execution mode.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Pierce with Needham.

Christopher Pierce
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Apologies if this came up earlier, but with the acquisition of Hawthorne, given its much different geographic footprint versus Salinas, do you have kind of carte blanche to fly test flights in that area? Or do you need to talk to the regulators further, given the higher population density or just broadly kind of going into basically a city?

Adam Goldstein
Founder, CEO & Chairman

So you can break this down in a couple of different ways. So this will not be used as our core test flight facility. We will still be using Salinas as our core test flights facility.

Once you get kind of certain hours maturity on the aircraft, you can start to fly and get permissions to fly in and around urban environments.

eIPP, as an example, is a way to help accelerate some of these paths. And so the eIPP is expected to have -- the cities get announced in the first quarter of next year. It's expected there'll be 5 and then for flights to take place starting in the summer.

And so we're hopeful that Hawthorne gets picked and that's one of the places that we can operate out of. It would make sense. It's right in the middle of all these operations that we're working on. But we'll see what happens.

And nonetheless, we'll be still using the airport as building up the different assets here as we build into just commercializing and ultimately into the Olympics.

Christopher Pierce
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

And did you feel like you needed to make this acquisition because maybe partners within the L.A. area weren't moving as fast as you like? Or is that kind of just some of the conjecture? Or I just kind of want to get a sense of what drove you to pull the trigger beyond just these assets don't come up for sale very often.

Adam Goldstein
Founder, CEO & Chairman

It's just very unique, Chris. It's not -- it's something like if we didn't do it now, it may never come up ever again or at least in my lifetime for us to go do something like that. And so need, I think the answer is no. Super opportunistic, I think the answer is definitely.

And so in the aviation world, I think this is viewed as like a absolutely treasured asset right in the middle of the city. And this airport is 3 miles from LAX.

So if you think about all the complexities that are at LAX, which we will not have to deal with. And so if you can connect this airport to LAX, it could end up being a massive terminal that is used to shuttle not just even hundreds of people, but potentially even thousands of people to the airport because you're out of a complex airspace where there's a jet landing at LAX every 90 seconds.

So just the opportunities here are quite incredible and it was just something that we couldn't pass up. And so it was viewed as something that was sort of a once-in-a-company kind of opportunity.

Operator

That will conclude our analyst question-and-answer session. I would now like to pass the call back over to Adam.

Adam Goldstein
Founder, CEO & Chairman

Thanks. So I'm going to go -- I know we're running -- I'm still going to go through at least one of the retail questions that was just asked. And so the question was, with the recent deal with Korean Air, are you pursuing further eVTOL deals and agreements with other major Asian aviation conglomerates?

So yes, I am personally spending a lot of time in the second half of this year abroad and I've been with customers, senior government leaders and particularly in the Middle East and in Asia and the reception has been very strong and incredibly validating. And so our model is certainly resonating.

The progress that we're making in the UAE, both in flight testing and on the regulatory development has driven a lot of inbound interest across the region and especially at countries that are looking to fast track commercial service with proven partners.

So we're seeing that same momentum in Asia and in Europe, as governments are looking to integrate urban air mobility into the national transportation strategies. So you've seen it in Korea and Japan, where we were selected as the air taxi partners for both of the national flag carriers.

And I think there's going to be a lot more coming. A lot of these conversations will converge at the Dubai Air Show. And so we look forward to sharing a lot more when the time is right.

So with that, I think I will wrap up the call. So I want to thank everybody for joining. This is a very meaningful time for our industry and we are building thoughtfully and steadily towards our vision. I want to thank the team, the partners for all their work and commitment and we look forward to sharing more progress next quarter. Thanks.

Operator

That concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation, and enjoy the rest of your day.
