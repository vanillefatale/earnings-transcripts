Your first question comes from the line of Josh Baer from Morgan Stanley.

Josh Baer
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Congrats on a strong quarter. I wanted to ask about GPV per location, which was up slightly year-over-year, I think, better than expected. Wondering how much of that was driven by mix, so just lower mix of customers in more pressured parts of the market or maybe -- and/or how much is coming from Toast customers just outperforming peers? And if that is part of the case, just wondering if you -- what kind of data do you look at? Is it more a selection bias as far as the customers that you land? Or how much is it your actual technology increasing sales?

Aman Narang
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. We saw in Q3 and the summer was GPV per location exceeded expectations. And as we look at October, I think it normalized a little bit. But overall, it's in line with what we expected. I think certainly, our platform, a big part of what we build is to help restaurants run a more profitable and more successful business. And so a lot of the investments we continue to make in handheld, for example, in [indiscernible] is an example of that to help restaurants run a better business. And same-store sales, I think, have been in a balanced place year-over-year. So nothing that has dramatically changed.

Our next question comes from the line of Will Nance from Goldman Sachs.

William Nance
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I think, obviously, really nice results tonight. You talked about a clear path to doubling your market share in core SMB. And I think there's been really heightened focus on competition recently. And honestly, probably as a reaction to how much you yourselves have raised the bar on how to approach this market, pretty much every competitor has doubled down trying to catch up. So can you just speak to some of those competitive concerns? You mentioned win rates being up against peers. How are you thinking about the sustainability of your recent market share gains and maybe how long it takes to reach that goal of ultimately doubling your share in the core market?

Aman Narang
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks for the question, Will. First of all, I just want to congratulate the team. We had a fantastic Q3, really had a fantastic year so far. Team is performing well. If you look at our net adds, as I mentioned, they're up in Q3, they're tracking to be up every quarter this year. And it's really a direct result of the execution of the team.

Our win rates, as I mentioned, are up year-over-year against all major competitors. And that's actually both in QSR and FSR. Our go-to-market team on the ground continues to execute at a high level. And one of the things they have is to maximize location growth. This is across our payments and our SaaS revenue. They've got the tools across upfront fees and hardware and services to make sure that they can go, take the location down and win because we've got this upsell engine to complement the new location team.

And then lastly, of course, the most important thing underpinning this growth is our core platform, right? We were the first ones to build a restaurant-focused platform that was purpose-built for this industry, and we continue to innovate and drive customer-focused innovation for our customers. Toast IQ is a great example of that, helping restaurants run a better business. Our aspiration is really to build the best GPT interface for the restaurant industry.

And I think in terms of the timing, you asked the question about timing, Will, I think if you look at our net adds this year in our core business, they're in about the same range as last year. So it just shows you the market share gains we're gaining every year as we continue to grow and scale.

Your next question comes from Timothy Chiodo from UBS.

Timothy Chiodo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I want to shift gears a little bit to talk a little bit more about the opportunity that Toast has with consumers. So back when you had maybe 100,000 restaurants or so, maybe some of the stuff was less applicable because maybe the network wasn't quite as dense, but it's getting there and you're on your way to being north of 200,000. And I was wondering if you could just talk about what does that mean in terms of an opportunity? You've got some pieces, right, Toast Tables, Toast Takeout, the Uber partnership and much more, there could be gift cards. Just talk a little bit about what that dense network gives you as an advantage versus some of your competitors? And what kind of products could come out of that?

Aman Narang
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. That's a great question, Tim. If you look at our scale and the impact that's already having, you already see examples of that even beyond consumer, just to zoom out for a second. You've got millions of restaurant employees using Toast. And when you walk into Toast restaurants, a consistent theme that I hear is that they love Toast and they want to work at Toast run restaurants.

Another example is we launched -- about a year ago, we launched a benchmarking product, which was to help restaurants with menus and pricing insights to run better businesses just off the menu data. So there are many examples where our scale and our network effects are playing a role.

And in consumer, in fact, this morning, I woke up and the first thing I did was I went to a restaurant locally in Lexington, Massachusetts got a Revival Cafe. And one of my favorite things about the app is you can order ahead and just pick it up and leave. And similar to what Starbucks pioneered many years ago. And so we can do that across 100,000-plus Toast restaurants here in the U.S. People love that experience.

In addition, I think where we have a unique opportunity is to bring diners into stores. So whether it's our partnership with Resy and Tock as part of the Amex partnership or with Toast Tables, the ability to get a table, sit down. And then one of the things that we're looking at is imagine the ability to just walk out and leave at the end of the transaction because you've got a card on file. And so there's a huge opportunity there in terms of providing a better guest experience, both in terms of bringing diners into the restaurant and then leaving the restaurant as well.

And within the app, one feature that a lot of people have heard love is because we've got such great data about the restaurants and when they're busy and when they're not, the ability to generate intelligent offers during their slow periods and the ability to track all your loyalty in one place is another thing that we're getting some really good feedback on. So I agree with you, there's a lot of potential here given the density of restaurants that we now have. And I think really the focus is on figuring out how we can build the best in-store experience and digitize that experience for restaurants.

Your next question comes from Dan Dolev from Mizuho.

Dan Dolev
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Obviously, great results here. I wanted to ask about just the consumer in general, like the macro, right? There's been a lot of like anxiety out there. And obviously, your results are looking great. So maybe you can talk to us what you're seeing kind of maybe in the quarter, but also more recently as we are in Q4, that would be fantastic.

Aman Narang
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks for the question. Look, the summer was strong. Q3 was strong year-over-year. What we saw in October on the consumer has normalized a little bit, but really within a narrow band and in line with kind of what our expectations were. And so our customers and our restaurants are performing well. One of the things we always look at is whether it's in boom markets or slower markets, we've done and studied previous recessions in '01 and '08. And what we've seen is that restaurants tend to be resilient. And what we're seeing so far in our data is our customers are holding up really well.

The next question comes from Dominic Ball from Rothschild & Co Redburn.

Dominic Ball
Rothschild & Co Redburn, Research Division

Aman, just to start with, I mean, fantastic to hear that you guys are saying that Toast can double its market share in its core talent. It's amazing. With digital chits within Toast IQ, it looks like one of the best products from our perspective that you launched over the last sort of 5 years. When we survey private full-service restaurant owners, the dream is really to understand their customer when they walk in. And because waiters and waitresses churn so much, it's really hard to do that, but this sort of product seems to be offering that. So is there any case studies on any early data points and how this has gone so far?

Aman Narang
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Dominic. We're seeing -- just to zoom out for a second across Toast IQ, we're seeing lots and lots of use cases like that where customers are seeing the value of having all of their data actually drive value for them, right? So digital chits is a great example of that. In the past, if you're using a separate reservation system and a legacy point of sale, you're maybe printing that out on paper. But the ability to have that digitally on your handheld just makes that experience even more powerful because you can connect the guest experience to what's in the menu to drive upsell as well as to create a more personalized experience right at the table. So that's a great example of that.

I think more broadly, within our Toast IQ platform, we're seeing really high adoption of our back end because customers love the fact that they can use more of a natural language interface. I think of a GPT-like interface where they can go in and say, get support, make changes to their back end, whether it's like 86 and adding, for example, or adding specials as well as just get insight about what's going on in their business in terms of profitability, in terms of what's selling well and how things are going. And so there's a lot of use cases within the Toast IQ umbrella. Digital chits is a good example of that, but really excited to see the progress and the adoption so far and what the product can do for our customers.

Our next question comes from David Hynes from Canaccord Genuity.

David Hynes
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

Congrats on nice quarter. Aman, I wanted to ask how you saw the business performed during the AWS outage. Anecdotally, I talked to restaurants up here in the Boston area. It sounded like everyone kind of cut over to offline mode. It worked well. They're able to collect payment information. I assume run those later. I think they did have to shut down online ordering, which I'm sure is factored into Elena's guidance for Q4, as small as it was being a Monday launch, it seems. What did you hear about competitive disruptions? Is this a differentiating point of toast? Like how did the business hold up during that period?

Aman Narang
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. DJ, the business held up fine because -- precisely because we've spent the past decade really building this platform for restaurants. And one of the key requirements is if something is down, whether the Internet or AWS or whatever it may be, you got to be able to operate within the restaurant. And so our customers were able to take orders, send their orders to kitchens, take payments offline. And as they came back -- as the system came back, they're able to process those off of offline mode.

Certainly, we see that the need to leverage these digital channels, whether it's our first-party channels or our partner ecosystem, that has grown, right, over the years. And so we're looking at ways to continue to make that even more resilient. And -- but I think customers overall, we're able to work through it, and I don't think there's any meaningful impact in terms of guidance for Q4.

Our next question comes from Rayna Kumar from Oppenheimer.

Rayna Kumar
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Great results. It was good to see the total take rate up 7 basis points from a year ago. I'm just wondering how sustainable an improving take rate is.

Elena Gomez
President, CFO and Interim Chief Accounting & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. Thank you. Yes, I'm really proud also of the team here on their execution. Take rate was up -- the core net take rate was up 4 basis points and the total take rate up about 5 basis points. And that's really the benefits we're seeing from the small targeted pricing moves. It's COGS optimization, which is a priority for that team. It's also new products like surcharging, which is small today and contributing a little bit, but over time, that can drive -- that can be more meaningful as we get more customers on that product.

But when you zoom out, we have a lot of confidence in our ability to drive take rate up over time, really using those same levers, driving cost optimization on a per transaction basis, driving more digital innovation and continuing to scale just with our volume. So really view that as an opportunity.

The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Wells Fargo.

Jason Kupferberg
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to ask about recurring gross profit. I mean you delivered, I think, about 1,000 basis points of upside on that metric in the quarter. It's a lot even by Toast standards. And I think this was against the lapping effect of last year's accounting change. And so I'm curious, as you kind of rank order, what kind of surprised you to the upside, GPV, Toast Capital, other factors?

And then just looking at typical Q4 seasonality on the recurring gross profit, I think it tends to be up kind of modestly quarter-over-quarter versus Q3. But if we look at the top end of the Q4 guidance, I think you'd be down a little bit. So I'm just curious if there's any call-outs there. I mean, obviously, you've had a track record of being able to handily outperform, but I wanted to see if there's anything else we might be missing on that front.

Elena Gomez
President, CFO and Interim Chief Accounting & Principal Accounting Officer

Thanks, Jason. You actually summarized it quite well. So our guidance for Q4 is 25% growth at the high end, and we're always going to aim to do better. We do take a balanced view of GPV just given the macro dynamic. But as you said, we saw strong GPV trends in the summer. We also had a strong quarter from Toast Capital, and we're seeing that more normalize in Q4. So overall, we're really confident with the guidance that we've given.

Our next question comes from Stephen Sheldon from William Blair.

Stephen Sheldon
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Great results. I wanted to follow up on a prior question on Toast IQ. Great to hear that I think it was over 25,000 locations have used it, which is a lot more than I would have expected this early. So just wanted an update there of how we should think about the financial impact of that, including higher AI costs associated with hosting. With that kind of adoption, I think in a month, I'd assume that you're not selling it as a separate SKU. So am I right on that assumption? Do you plan to eventually sell it as a separate SKU? Or could that be used as part of the basis for SaaS pricing increases or better product attach rates as we think about the next year or 2?

Aman Narang
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. Great question, Stephen. I mean right now, the focus on Toast IQ is really on adoption and really driving customer value. As I mentioned, really excited about the early adoption from customers and the value they're getting. If you look at like what opportunities this creates for Toast, one, I think because people are using it so much to run their businesses, there's product-led growth opportunities to expand our platform.

Another area that we're starting to invest in is if you look at like our marketing platform, for example, we started off with e-mail text and ads, but now we've got AI-driven automation to create personalized marketing campaigns because, as you can imagine, restauranteurs, especially SMB restaurant tours are busy and they're not marketers and have the time to generate these campaigns.

And so you can imagine Agentic capabilities within Toast IQ to start to recommend these campaigns when they're slower or at different times. And so whether it's on marketing or it's on back-office functions like accounting or bookkeeping or even payroll, we see lots of opportunities to drive key Agentic use cases within Toast IQ to drive adoption and value.

I think in terms of monetization, it's early. We're looking at different ways. I think one obvious way that we're going to look at is just like GPT, look at usage-based monetization on Toast IQ. But the most important focus here right now is to make sure we're getting adoption and really great value for customers to help drive our growth.

Our next question comes from Samad Samana from Jefferies.

Samad Samana
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

It's great to see the strong results. I guess I'm pretty focused here on pricing. It's going to be a little multiparter, which first is the pricing on the website, fully realizing the disclosure the company made. But was there some intention that somebody was exploring maybe testing and targeting or AV testing? Just maybe help us understand what happened there.

And then just the comments on the targeted fintech pricing moves that you've made. Like how much of the back book have you now maybe pushed price through? I know that these are focusing on 2 different pieces, but pricing, I think, is a really big focus right now for everybody. So I appreciate you listening the questions.

Elena Gomez
President, CFO and Interim Chief Accounting & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. Thanks, Samad, for the question. So I'll start with the website, which was human error. And as soon as we discovered it, we fixed it. You're right, we do tests from time to time. This certainly was not a test. And actually, that part of the website gets 1% of our bookings, so not material overall. So we corrected that and moved on.

In terms of pricing, our philosophy is unchanged. It's really -- the way we think about it, it's really just one lever of growth, and we'll still make targeted and surgical price changes. And we'll balance that with market share potential, of course. And in the near term, gaining share is a high priority, and we know we can optimize price over time. In terms of how much of the back book, we haven't really disclosed that, but we feel confident as long as we're driving value, we'll be able to drive price over time in small targeted ways. And as we bring customers on to our platform, they're coming in at the market rates.

We will now take our last question from the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research.

Darrin Peller
Wolfe Research, LLC

Just maybe help us understand what gives you the confidence in your ability to see increased net adds in '26. Just how much might come from the TAM expansion areas driving the growth versus the core business versus the core business you've been adding so well so far?

Aman Narang
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. Sure, Darrin. If you look at the trend we've seen in the past year, our core net adds are in the same range as last year. And so if you look at how we've been able to drive record net adds every quarter this year, it's really from these new TAMs contributing more. And we expect really the same trend to continue next year. We expect the core to continue to perform at a high level based upon the signal we're seeing and then these new TAMs to play a bigger role.

If you look at like the longer-term opportunity, if you just zoom out for a second and see what's possible in these TAMs, I think what's exciting to me is there's so much overlap in the core platform between our core U.S. SMB business and these new TAMs, which is why we've been able to grow this business to close to $100 million in ARR just in a couple of years. And that's what's really going to drive the incremental net adds in our business next year.
