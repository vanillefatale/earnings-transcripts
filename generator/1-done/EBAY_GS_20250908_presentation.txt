Okay. I think in the interest of time, we're going to keep moving with our next one here. It's my pleasure to introduce the team from eBay. We have Jamie Iannone, CEO; and Peggy Alford, new CFO. So first off, to start saying Peggy, congrats on the new role. And to both of you, congrats on eBay's 30th anniversary. There was a lot of press coverage around it. Congratulations on the milestone for the company. And what were some of the memories of celebrating it with the team and with being out there talking about it the last couple of days?


Jamie Iannone
CEO, President & Director

Yes. We had our very first employee who still is with the company there. We have long-time sellers there representing the company, which was awesome. And it was fun celebrating 30 years, but it was also a moment to talk about we're just getting started and all the excitement of what's happening in the company. So it's fun.
