Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question coming from the line of Shar Pourreza with Wells Fargo.

Shahriar Pourreza
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Joe, just on your hyperscaler comment. I mean, obviously, we've seen a lot of BTM deals being done ironically with nonpower companies. Couldn't quite tell from the baseball analogy, but are you still kind of confident with announcing another hyperscale deal by year-end? Or should we assume early next year. And despite FERC, should we still assume that this deal or any deal will be structured in front of the meter?

Joseph Dominguez
President, CEO & Director

Yes. As to the last question, yes, right now, as I've indicated on prior calls, we're really focused exclusively on front-of-the-meter deals, which is why this interconnection process ends up becoming, to a certain extent, the gating function on these deals, and we often have to wait for other parties. Shar, my expectation is that deals will be completed soon. I think it will happen before we talk again. But I don't -- there are these approval processes that customers have to go through that sometimes are time consuming. And I don't want -- I can't guarantee the work of other parties. But we're quite close here. So I'm hopeful that this stuff will get done soon and certainly before our fourth quarter call.

Shahriar Pourreza
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. No, that's actually helpful. And then just lastly, just from a contracting pricing perspective, I mean, we obviously -- we have a proxy right now in Texas for BTM deal with significant backup gen. Are you seeing FOM and BTM pricing kind of converge in your conversations, especially since you're focused more on the FOM side? And just what about gas versus nuclear, especially as you're closing the Calpine deal?

Joseph Dominguez
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think gas has some capabilities in this space. Just to answer that part of your question. I think the real issue with gas for the customers is twofold. One is, does it meet their longer-term sustainability goals? For some customers, it's okay. For other customers, it isn't. And then separately, in the case of gas, it's sometimes more difficult to predict the kind of long-term pricing. So when you're asking me to compare pricing for gas, whether that's behind the meter or front of the meter to a nuclear deal, we end up having to speculate about what future gas prices are going to be, say, over 20 years, we end up having to speculate whether or not there are going to be other compliance costs associated with carbon emissions from gas.

So really hard to do that. Oftentimes, the gas deals leave those issues open to different inputs for either a carbon price, a change in policy and of course, for the underlying cost of gas. So hard to compare the 2 things. And generally speaking, the deals that you're alluding to that have been done really haven't been done with new clean resources that allow for the comp. So a bit hard to say.

I do think that from an economic perspective, what we're offering, and I think it's part of the heat that we're seeing in terms of the inflow of customers through the door is very attractive pricing relative to other options, and pricing that's firm and sustainable for a long-term period and something that they know from their own environmental pledges and sustainability goals is going to be compliant for them.

Shahriar Pourreza
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. But just -- I guess, just focusing a little bit on just nuclear FOM versus BTM pricing. Is there a material difference? Are you seeing when those conversations just honing in on nuclear?

Joseph Dominguez
President, CEO & Director

Shar, I think it's hard yet to fully understand what the new nuclear pricing is going to be. I mean, that's -- the bottom line is we do a tremendous amount of work on that. And I think it's far from settled what that's going to look like. Obviously, what we could offer is significantly more economic. And most importantly, it's available right now.

Operator

Our next question coming from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.

Steven Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

I guess, first, just a question on the Calpine. There were some stories about a potential delay in the asset sale process by you? Just is there anything that we should read into that?

Joseph Dominguez
President, CEO & Director

Probably a couple of things, Steve. One is we kicked off the asset sale process because we weren't sure how much time we were going to be given to divest needed assets. And so we're feeling more confident that we're going to have a reasonable amount of time to execute the divestiture post regulatory approvals. And secondly, as we complete the regulatory approvals, it is, as you know, DOJ and FERC utilize different tests. And so we want to make sure we're targeting the exact right assets to divest.

Biggest point here is that we just don't feel like we need to be in a hurry to complete an asset sale transaction, and we want to take our time. The market is very supportive of sales of these assets right now.

Steven Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Yes. And I guess there'll be others that have pending ones that will be done later on maybe. That could be buyers.

Okay. So the other question is more just high level, I mean for the last several months, we just keep hearing different new entrants to the Power business, whether it's oil companies, gas companies, new technologies, et cetera. And then obviously, huge focus on time to power. But then at the same time, it seems to take a very long time to work out deals for those same customers with the assets that are there already. And maybe you can just help connect the dots of what's going on and your conviction level that you'll be able to kind of execute on the ability to capture these new customers?

Joseph Dominguez
President, CEO & Director

I think the excitement and interest in new generation is just really a reflection on how durable this growth cycle is going to be. We're seeing these -- the investment in new data centers just grow over year-over-year, and we're now seeing capital deployment projected to be $0.75 trillion on building data centers. And notably, that's probably twice as large as the 3 largest publicly traded power companies in the United States.

So we're seeing an investment in the data economy that's simply enormous, and it's going to call for all hands on deck. And I'm always pleased to see that they believe in it so much that they're lining up power needs that are really going to come on 5 or in certain cases, maybe up to 10 years down the road. So I think that's all indicative of the size of the opportunity that we're seeing.

Steve, I'd just simply stand by my earlier comments that the amount of interest we have, the number of deals that are being negotiated is far different now and far bigger and more serious now than it's been before. And so that's what gives me confidence we're going to be able to continue to execute the strategy. And I think we provide something uniquely and that's available now, power, with a predictable opportunity to scale that.

Our next question coming from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.

Jeremy Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

We just wondered if you could provide a little bit of color on Three Mile Island, it seems like progress is going well there. Just wondering if you could provide any updated thoughts?

Joseph Dominguez
President, CEO & Director

Well, just what you said. I mean the progress is going well there. We've had a number of critical items that we've completed just recently. The plant looks really well. We talked at the beginning of this whole project that we are going to need a couple of components, the main transformer being one of them. Fuel was another gating item, getting the people ready to operate the site. That was a gating item, Bryan, who's here and his entire team have just done an exceptional job getting the plant ready and really tackling some of these challenges that we identified.

Most importantly, we're not seeing new challenges emerge, right? So as we continue to do our work, there's always going to be some discovery that comes along with the inspections of the plant. And what gives me great confidence is that we're not unearthing anything that we didn't anticipate. And in point of fact, the condition of the plant is better.

Jeremy Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Very helpful there. And just wondering if you might be able to comment a little bit as well separately on power markets. We've seen energy prices moving up recently and just wondering thoughts you have on these moves where it could go, and do you see this having any, I guess, impact on conversations when you're discussing contracts?

Joseph Dominguez
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think it has 2 impacts strategically for us. One, right, is the -- questions I think we've already gotten here. Are we seeing some sort of convergence that causes us to think we're not going to achieve our pricing expectations? And I would say the opposite is true. And then secondly, we're going to have to sell some assets here to get through regulatory approvals. And I think the impact there, again, is favorable and that the environment for the sale of assets is more constructive now than probably when we started the -- when we announced the Calpine deal. But let me ask Jim McHugh, who's here to kind of weigh in on what he's seeing in the power markets and their durability.

James McHugh
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. Yes. Thanks, Joe. I'd break it into a couple of components. One is maybe short term, we've seen a small rebound in the nearby, just kind of the nearby months, maybe gas rebound a little bit, that's had somewhat to do with power upward pressure that we've seen. But actually, the power upside has been longer duration than that, and it's been stronger in the outer years. And it's really outperformed gas. I think we're seeing expansion -- heat rates expanding and spark spreads expanding, mainly due to the data growth we're talking about, the load growth in general that we're talking about. We'll have continued -- some continued retirements down the road. There's less line of sight right now, as we've talked about, to additional megawatts in the grid except for all these wonderful opportunities that we've talked about in -- that Joe talked about in the call earlier as well as what we're seeing in terms of our corporate PPAs, bringing on new generation too.

But really, it's -- over the last few months, it's been the realization and positive developments on load interconnection and the reality of load growth happening where I think the power markets are pushing stronger. It's still rather tight on the supply-demand fundamentals in general. And it's really about the expectation that we'll see higher energy prices to go with some of the upward pressure we've seen on capacity prices in these markets, too.

Our next question coming from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.

David just withdrew his question.

Our next question coming from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank.

Andrew Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

A few questions for you. First, in Maryland. You talked about the 700 megawatts of natural gas capacity. I believe that's existing assets and you mentioned relocated turbines. Can you get a little more specific, where would those be coming from? And maybe on timing, how quickly would those be available to come online?

Joseph Dominguez
President, CEO & Director

They're physically located in buildings in the Midwest and in New England. And they're -- I would describe them as incredibly lightly used assets that we could relocate relatively quickly to Maryland. But in terms of their performance capabilities are relatively speaking, state-of-the-art in terms of their heat rates. And we have taken measures to refurbish those units and get them ready for rapid redeployment. So that, I think, is the answer to your question.

Andrew Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Great. Then on new nuclear. I know I'm pretty new to the story, but I know that you sounded pretty cautious about new nuclear construction, given the high cost and risks. But with the announcements from the federal government, has that changed your comfort level or given -- has that changed your appetite? And what would it take you to get you to move forward? Whether you need government support and the customer contracts? I know you've talked about exploring potentially 2 gigawatts near Calvert Cliffs in Maryland. And New York is considering adding a gigawatt, as you mentioned. Maybe just high-level thoughts on all of that?

Joseph Dominguez
President, CEO & Director

First and foremost is a PPA, right? We need a durable PPA. And the second thing is, we need clear pricing that we're going to be able to achieve with constructability. And that means good partners that bring the technical capability and the ability to construct along with that. We also think, as I alluded to in my prepared remarks, we also think the land value that we offer is the secret sauce to this whole thing. I think you're not going to build nuclear plants in the places we do business with the exception perhaps of Texas, in communities that have never had nuclear before. And I think there's a huge value to having that talent, having the big water, the rail, all the infrastructure and most importantly, the community acceptance.

So what I'm looking to do is to monetize the value of that land and that set of capabilities that we bring and convert that into a position that gives us some of the output of the new units.

The next thing we're trying to do is make sure that whatever gets operated on our land because we have operating units, gets operated by us, not by others. So an operating services agreement will have to be part of it.

In terms of what enables it, I talked about the importance of a PPA. I think the involvement of the administration and the way that they're talking about with Westinghouse likewise is going to be critically important. And I commend President Trump for his incredible leadership on nuclear. We still need to see the details, and we still need to see, as I said, earlier, some very, very clear cost numbers and some very, very clear commitments to deliver those costs on time and on schedule with an operating unit before we are going to put significant capital at risk for these things. I like the way things are evolving. I have been cautious, and I remain cautious, and I will always be cautious because it's a lot of your money that we are talking about here. But I am gaining confidence daily as more and more qualified players are coming forward. And as we're seeing things like the Westinghouse announcement. We still need to get all of the details to really fully understand it, but it is no doubt a positive.

Our next question coming from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.

David Arcaro
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Could you maybe also reflect on your demand response efforts and the initiative that you're pursuing there? And I know you've talked about flexibility of data centers in the past. Are you seeing progress there in terms of data center willingness to go that route? And just the update on that initiative across different markets?

Joseph Dominguez
President, CEO & Director

Well, let me start on what I'm seeing in terms of flexibility from a technical capability. And then I'm going to turn it over to Jim McHugh, again, who runs our commercial team to talk about this exciting work we're doing on demand response. So we have been, since the very beginning, one of the core participants in EPRI and their DC Flex or data center flex capability. And we're seeing a lot of great capability to use backup generation and flex compute. I don't want to overstate that, however, I don't think we're going to get to a point where we could flex on and off the full output of data centers. I think it's going to have a meaningful impact, but it's going to have an impact at the margins.

That's why we began to explore using AI to see if we can attract some of our other customers to actually providing the relief or the slack on the system during the key hours, and they would then use their own backup generation or curtail their own consumption of energy during peak hours. And we could play this kind of well, middleman role between the hyperscalers and the data center owners and operators and our other customers through this commercial agreement that gives them the ability to call on our other customers to curtail during high-demand events. So Jim will talk about the work that we've done to start developing that and the exciting progress we've made.

James McHugh
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. Thanks, Joe. It kind of started with what we were doing in the market prior to kind of the recent dynamics. We still had a large amount of our customers who are interested in peak response programs and managing their energy usage. But really with the dynamic shifting towards supply needed in the capacity markets, we saw the opportunity that some of these customers may be interested in being demand response providers and supply to the capacity markets. So we're partnering with Grid Beyond and who is going to help us do a lot of the execution on the operations side with our demand response customers, but we're seeing interest from our industrial customer base to participate in this demand response product.

And what's a little unique about the product we're offering is we've gone to customers to get longer tenors or longer-term commitments and they're interested in potentially longer-term deals with good pricing associated with it and we're providing some floor pricing capability in that too for them to be incented to sign up for these longer duration. So we've found kind of this unique opportunity. We're trying to be innovative around the product structure itself. And the pipeline looks really strong right now. We started executing the deals that Joe talked about working towards 1,000 megawatts or so between now and the next couple of capacity auctions. So things are going well.

Joseph Dominguez
President, CEO & Director

And David, what's cool about that is when you think about that 1,000 megawatts at the electric load carrying capacity or through that computation that PJM does, that looks like a new nuclear plant. It's not like a 1,000 megawatts of battery, for example, that would look like at the end of the day, 1/10 of a new nuclear plant. But this portends to look like a full nuclear units worth of output in terms of demand response. So I think we're still in the early days of this, but I think the combination of the two things you talked about in your question, the ability to flex at the top of peak by the data centers themselves in combination with new commercial arrangements to get others to pull back consumption during these hours is really going to open up a lot of room on the system and really pave the way for easier interconnection.

David Arcaro
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes. Understood. Okay. Great. That's helpful color. Then I was wondering if you could just touch on what you're seeing in terms of retail margins in PJM. One of your peers suggested that margins in PJM might be somewhat more competitive. I'm wondering if that's reflective of what you're seeing.

Joseph Dominguez
President, CEO & Director

Jim?

James McHugh
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes, I think on the retail side, our margins are on the upper end of the range that we've always talked about. We've certainly seen on the wholesale auction, load auction and polar procurements. So we've seen some new participants coming in, that's gotten a little bit more competitive, but we're still seeing stronger margins than the historical averages there. On the retail side, really on the upper end of the ranges we've always talked about. And I want to -- I would have -- I'd be remiss if I didn't add since we're seeing a lot of success with some of these sustainability products and CFE and other types of solutions that are sustainability related, those margins tend to be stronger than pure true commodity margins, too.

Our next question coming from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport.

Agnieszka Storozynski
Seaport Research Partners

I'm just wondering, and again, somewhat of a playing the devil's advocate here. I mean you have a huge portfolio of generation assets, especially pro forma Calpine. There's this growing chatter about bringing your own generation. And I'm just wondering if you're feeling a bit unease about how many of these units you will be able to sign and granted that solar power curves are rising, but it's not just about earnings, right? It's also about the visibility and the quality of earnings. And so we do need more of your units to have that long-term visibility into their earnings power?

Joseph Dominguez
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Angie, and I'll just -- my comments during the call were informed by all things, including what we're seeing in terms of policy regulatory, we still believe that we're going to be able to execute transactions. I think this product offering that Jim just talked about with demand response is a bit of an anticipation isn't it, some of what you're talking about, which is to try to make sure we have BYOG or bring your own generation equivalent as we think about demand response as we think about the turbines that we have on the sidelines as we think about our ability to offer up rates.

And we also think that policymakers fully understand that relicensing, while not exactly a new megawatt, is the continuation of megawatts beyond the period that they might otherwise shut down. So we think that there's great awareness of that issue. I think in large measure, it was that issue and other compelling arguments that caused PJM to pull back from their bring-your-own generation kind of requirements that they had in other places. I think we might see some voluntary BYOG. But I'm frankly not concerned with where it is right now in the States. And we're marching forward on these transactions, and that has not been an issue for us right now.

Agnieszka Storozynski
Seaport Research Partners

Okay. And then so it's been mentioned by you in previous questions that we have seen a lot of announcements from other companies vaguely associated with power for power plants. And I'm wondering, is it -- do you think those are comparable deals like quality-wise, firmness wise, to the ones that you guys are working on? I mean some power companies suggest that those deals are more equivalent to LOIs than firm take-or-pay power contracts that public power companies announce?

Joseph Dominguez
President, CEO & Director

Look, I think there's probably room for a bunch of different contracting. But Angie, I feel and I could only gauge this from the customer interest in what we're offering. I feel that what we have and what we're offering outcompetes just about any other opportunity in the space.

Our next question coming from the line of James West with Melius Research.

James West
Melius Research LLC

Curious, given all this demand from the data economy and the data centers, how are you thinking about the portfolio of generating assets that you would like to or would be comfortable locking into long-term PPAs versus keeping available for normal generation markets?

Joseph Dominguez
President, CEO & Director

Great question. I think -- and you're certainly hearing this from Angie's question and others, I think there's more room to run on the long-term deals that we want to get executed. But there will be a point, and there will be a point where 1 or 2 things is going to happen. Either we're going to slow it up or we're going to change our pricing to more aggressive levels to reflect, frankly, the scarcity value of what we'll be able to offer. We're not quite there yet.

But -- look, our incentive is to provide sustainable long-term and growing earnings for our owner base. That's what the company is set up to do. And so in the short term, what we're trying to do is get these deals done. We're happy with the kind of atmospherics in the market being quite positive for us. But we're not at a point where we're even entertaining the discussion of, hey, are we going to stop selling long term? I think it's in our interest, it's in our customers' interest, it's in the nation's interest, for us to meet this demand for this incredibly important load that's coming on the system. And so we're going to continue to execute in that space. And I appreciate your question, but I think it's probably more theoretical than practical at this point.

Operator

Our last question coming from the line of Paul Zimbardo with Jefferies.

Unknown Analyst

Joe, the powerbroker, that was a nice piece recently, I got to say, nicely done. Let me follow up a little bit...

Joseph Dominguez
President, CEO & Director

Well, it's one of those embarrassing things that happens when you're in the middle of something like this, but thank you for noting it.

Unknown Analyst

Absolutely. Not too shabby. Look, let me follow up on a couple of things here real quickly. First, with respect to uprates, you've alluded to it, both on scale and scope here. I mean can you speak to the opportunity generically? I'll take note of the Pennsylvania governor's disclosure on costs relative to the 340 megawatts at Limerick. I mean, are there more Limericks out there in terms of effectively providing an upgrade that's tantamount to the size of an SMR? And specifically, as it pertains to Limerick, can you elaborate a little bit on where you are on the transmission interconnect process there? I mean it seems like there's some public disclosure about some potential data center there, if you can?

Joseph Dominguez
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So [ Julien ], I apologize for the Paul thing. I now see the 2 of you guys as the same person apparently, sorry about that. We identified about 900 extra megawatts. And so the big chunky ones there are LaSalle and Limerick, which are effectively kind of the same size, but have different costs. LaSalle is a bit easier to execute than Limerick. And I don't think we've published costs on that. And then we've got Calvert Cliffs, 190 megawatts that I talked about. So all told, we're looking at about 900 to 1,000 megawatts that we've completed engineering work on and feel pretty confident about. So that's the answer to the upgrade question.

In terms of -- I think you were talking about Crane interconnection. Is that what you asked about?

Unknown Analyst

Well, I was thinking about Limerick, right? I mean it seems like there's some transmission, yes, go for it.

Joseph Dominguez
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So there's a good deal of demand going in that area. So we're quite hopeful that any new megawatts at Limerick would be welcomed and fairly easy to interconnect. That's a big growing area of Pennsylvania in terms of the data economy. That, and of course, the PPL zone.

In terms of what's being done by customers to interconnect data centers around Limerick, I think I'm going to just kind of decide not to answer that question.

Unknown Analyst

Don't worry, maybe I'll give you another one to follow up on here. You talked about the cost of new nuclear here, both for yourselves as well as the industry. I mean cost of these uprates though seems to be materially cheaper than any new nuclear costs we're seeing out there, even if it's more relevant than what we've seen historically. Would it be fair to assume that the next round of efforts on your front, especially with this focus on additionality would focus on these -- leveraging these uprate sites first and foremost? I mean, obviously, we've seen your restarts here take a lot of the limelight at the outset, but the uprates seem to be the next wave here of where you could really win on additionality and in contracting, it would seem, right?

Joseph Dominguez
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Although [ Julien ], I tend not to think about these things as binary, i.e., you're not going to not do something because you're doing uprates. But in terms of the economic merits of the uprates, you're spot on. Those are great investments for us. They have the advantage of not just being additional. We think the relicensings are additional as well. But they also have the ability to be something that's really well within our wheelhouse to execute. We've done a lot of this work historically. And Bryan, the team do really great work in that regard.

As I said, we've done the engineering work. It's in communities that already like this stuff. And most importantly, when you're talking about an uprate like this, reason the economics are so attractive is you're not adding people, you're not adding O&M. The plant is just getting more output, but you don't have either an O&M drag from people and you don't have an O&M drag on extra fuel. So it's hard to compare kind of the capital numbers for an uprate to a brand-new plant, which would, of course, require you to have a whole bunch of additional O&M.

And I think let me just -- not to drag this out, but I think sometimes when people are talking about the cost of new nuclear and whether it's going to be competitive as a solution for contracts, so on and so forth. They tend to look at it from a capital cost perspective, and I certainly understand that because that's the way people have become accustomed to looking at things like renewables and storage and even new gas fire generation. But there's a huge O&M piece with nuclear that has to be carefully understood that factors into the ultimate price of that resource.

Folks, I think that brings the end, Olivia, right? That's the end of the call list here?

Operator

Yes, sir, there are no further questions.

Joseph Dominguez
President, CEO & Director
