And our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.

Justin Post
BofA Securities, Research Division

I'll ask on AWS. Can you just kind of go through how you're feeling about your capacity levels and how capacity constrained you are right now? And then in your prepared remarks, you mentioned Trainium3 demand and maybe broadening out your customer base. Can you talk about the demand you're seeing outside of your major customers for Trainium?

Andrew Jassy
President, CEO & Director

Yes. On the capacity side, we brought in quite a bit of capacity, as I mentioned in my opening comments, 3.8 gigawatts of capacity in the last year with another gigawatt plus coming in the fourth quarter and we expect to double our overall capacity by the end of 2027. So we're bringing in quite a bit of capacity today, overall in the industry, maybe the bottleneck is power. I think at some point, it may move to chips, but we're bringing in quite a bit of capacity. And as fast as we're bringing in right now, we are monetizing it.

And then on the Tranium demand, outside of our major customers. So first of all, as I mentioned on Trainium2, it's really doing well. It's fully subscribed on Trainium2. We have -- it's a multibillion-dollar business at this point. It grew 150% quarter-over-quarter in revenue. And you see really big projects at scale now, like our Project Rainier that we're doing with Anthropic, where they're running their next version of -- they're training the next version of Claude on top of Trainium2 on 500,000 Trainium2 chips going to 1 million Trainium2 chips by the end of the year.

As I mentioned, we have -- today, with Trainium2, we have a small number of very large customers on it. But because Trainium is 30% to 40% more price performant than other options out there, and because as customers, as they start to contemplate broader scale of their production workloads, moving to being AI-focused and using inference, they badly care about price performance. And so we have a lot of demand for Trainium. Trainium3 should preview at the end of this year with much fuller volumes coming in the beginning of '26, we have a lot of customers, both very large, and I'll call it, medium-sized who're quite interested in Trainium3.

And the next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

Brian Nowak
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Congrats on the quarter, guys. So maybe 2. One, Andy, sort of a philosophical chip question. There's a lot of questions in the market about Trainium and sort of its positioning versus other third-party chips. So how do you think about the key hurdles of Trainium3 need to overcome to really make Trainium adoption broader, to your point on the last question and continue to drive Trainium as opposed to satisfying what could be broader demand with third-party chips in the near term?

Andrew Jassy
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Well, first of all, we're always going to have multiple chip options for our customers. It's been true in every major technology building block or component that we've had in AWS. Really in the history of AWS, it's never just one player that over a long period of time has the entire market segment and then it can satisfy everybody's needs on every dimension. And so we have a very deep relationship with NVIDIA. We have for a very long time. And we will for as long as I can foresee the future. We buy a lot of NVIDIA. We are not constrained in any way in buying NVIDIA, and I expect that we'll continue to buy more NVIDIA both next year and in the future.

But we're different from most technology companies in that we have our own very strong chip team, and this is our Annapurna team. And you saw it first on the CPU side with what we built with Graviton which is about 40% better price performance than the other x86 processors, and you're seeing it again on the custom silicon on the AI side with Trainium, which is about the same amount of price performance benefit for customers relative to other GPU options.

And our customers to be able to use AI as expansively as they want. And remember, it's still relatively early days at this point. They're going to need better price performance and they care about it deeply. And so I mentioned earlier the momentum that Trainium2 has. And I think that for us, as we think about Trainium3, I expect Trainium3 will be about 40% better than Trainium2 and Trainium2 is already very advantaged on price performance.

So we have to, of course, deliver the chip. We have to deliver it in volumes and deliver it quickly. And we have to continue to work on the software ecosystem, which gets better all the time. And as we have more proof points like we have with Project Rainier with what Anthropic is doing on Trainium2, it builds increasing credibility for Trainium, and I think customers are very bullish about it. I'm bullish about it as well.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.

Douglas Anmuth
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I'll stick with basically the same topic, Andy. But can you just talk a little bit about the architecture of Project Rainier and how it's differentiated and what that means for customers and for AWS? And do you expect Rainier to expand beyond Anthropic? And how do you replicate Rainier with Trainium3 chips?

Andrew Jassy
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think what is compelling for Anthropic around Project Rainier is really is the Trainium2 chip, which -- we built a very -- first of all, we built a very large cluster that they can use in a very expansive way. And it's not simple to be able to build a cluster that has 500,000 plus chips going to 1 million. That's an infrastructure feet that's hard to do at scale. And so some piece of it is the infrastructure capabilities that we've built over a long period of time in AWS that is unusual in the industry. But it's just also the performance of the chip and the price performance, both of which matter.

And I think that Project Rainier is something that is specific for Anthropic, but we have a lot of other customers who are interested in employing large clusters of Trainium chips that we're going to hopefully give them a chance to do so with Trainium3.

The next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.

Mark Stephen Mahaney
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I want to ask about 2 topics, groceries and then how to think about headcount in the future. And on groceries, I want to -- the perishables, I think last quarter, you talked about 70% or something of users had never purchased from perishables from Amazon before. Just talk about whether you -- I think you used the term, game changer, before. Does this mean that maybe we don't -- you no longer need to Amazon Fresh stores. You always had this DVD Delivery Van Density advantage. And have you kind of reached a point you think of scale and speed that you really can change people's habit and really have them consider Amazon as one of their first grocery options? Do you really feel like you're at that point?

And then secondly, just on the head count, some of the recent news. Just talk to us about how you think about headcount going forward? Are you seeing -- is the level of efficiencies that you're getting from AI such that you can keep headcount relatively flattish for the foreseeable future? Just talk about the pros and cons or the wins and losses in terms of that head count going forward?

Andrew Jassy
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So I'll start with grocery, Mark. We have a very large grocery business. If you look at our entire grocery business, if I don't even count Whole Foods Market and Fresh, in the last 12 months to over $100 billion of gross merchandising sales, which would make us a top 3 grocery in the U.S. A good chunk of it is a lot of the items that you'd find in the middle aisle so consumables and canned goods and pet food and health and beauty, very significant and continues to grow at a very good clip.

But then we also have Whole Foods Market, which is the pioneer in organic foods, which is also growing at a faster clip than most grocery companies with an attractive trajectory on profitability, and we'll expand our Whole Foods physical presence over the coming years here. And I'm also very excited about this new concept, daily shop that we have, which is a smaller version of Whole Foods in urban settings, which we have 3 that we've launched that are off to very good starts that you should expect to see more of as well.

And we have always been -- as you referenced, we've talked a lot about having a larger mass physical presence. And we continue to experiment with various formats. But the one that we are most excited about is what you referenced, which is the ability to provide perishable groceries with same-day deliveries. And if you think about how many of our customers are buying from us multiple times a week and who are buying things like shampoo or detergent or paper cups or water, where the ability to add milk and eggs and yogurt and other perishables to their order and have it live in the same shop in cart and then show up a few hours later, is very compelling.

And we started with a few markets about a year ago, and we were really taken aback at the adoption, not just the number of people that started buying perishables from us very quickly, but how often they came back downstream to buy perishables and groceries from us in the future. And so we've now expanded that to 1,000 cities around the U.S. and will be in 2,300 by the end of the year. And it's really changing the trajectory and the size of our grocery business.

And I also believe that this many years tradition of the weekly stock up grocery stock up is changing. And I think we're a big part of that. And I think there's a lot of potential there for the grocery side. It doesn't mean that we won't continue to experiment with other physical formats, but we're on to something very significant with what we're doing with perishables from our same-day facilities.

And then on your headcount question, what I would tell you is the announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now, at least. It really -- its culture. And if you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers.

And when that happens, sometimes without realizing that you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work and who own most of the 2-way door decisions, the ones that should be made quickly and right at the front line, and it can lead to slowing you down. As a leadership team, we are committed to operating like the world's largest start-up. And that means removing layers. It means increasing the amount of ownership that people have, and it means inventing and moving quickly.

And I don't know if there's ever been a time in the history of Amazon or maybe business in general with the technology transformation happening right now, where it's important to be lean, it's important to be flat, and it's important to move fast, and that's what we're going to do.

And the next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.

Eric Sheridan
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Wanted to know, Andy, if you could reflect on the opportunity that's continuing to present itself in terms of rolling out more robotics and automation and the broader theme of physical AI across your operations? And how should we be thinking about that as a driver of potential efficiencies, but also as a driver of the ability to possibly reinvest back in the business over the long term?

Andrew Jassy
President, CEO & Director

Robotics is a very substantial area of investment for us. We have over 1 million robots in our fulfillment network at this point. And I would say that while that's significant, we have a lot of invention in flight. So I expect that we'll have more over a period of time. Robotics are very important for us and for our customers and for our teammates because they improve safety, they boost productivity, they increase speed, and they let our human teammates focused on problem solving and what they do best.

And we expect that our people remain at the heart in the center of our fulfillment network as they have from when we first started working the robotics, And we expect that over time, we will have a fulfillment network where robots and humans complement each other and work together. But I think you're going to continue to see us invest very significantly in robotics. It's going to help on the safety, the productivity, the speed and ultimately some of the cost pieces, which will allow us to continue to improve the customer experience.

And the next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with TD Cowen.

John Blackledge
TD Cowen, Research Division

How does Amazon think about agentic commerce going forward? And how do you think Amazon will serve customers using agents to purchase goods on Amazon in the future?

Andrew Jassy
President, CEO & Director

I'm very excited about -- and as a business, we're very excited about in the long term the prospect of agentic commerce. And it has a chance to be good for customers, it has a chance to be really good for e-commerce. And I think if you're -- if you know what you want to buy, there are a few experiences that are better than coming to Amazon. But if you don't know what you want, it's -- physical store with a physical salesperson still has some advantages. Obviously, lots of people do it on Amazon all the time. But you very often want to ask questions and help -- get help narrowing what you're going to look for. And as you keep asking new questions, having a whole bunch of different options presented to you.

And I think AI and agentic commerce are going to change the experience online where that experience where you're narrowing what you want when you don't know is going to get better online than it even is in physical environments.

Now we obviously have our own efforts here in agentic commerce. We have Rufus, which I talked about in my opening comments, which is continuing to get better and better and used more broadly. And we have features like Buy for Me where we will surface on Amazon, even items that we don't stock that other merchants have. And then if customers want us to go and buy it for them on those merchants' websites, we will do that. And both of those have been successful for us. But we're also having conversations with and expect over time to partner with third-party agents. And I think that it reminds me in some ways of the beginning of search engines many years ago being sources of discovery for commerce. And you had to kind of figure out the right way to work together.

And today, search engines are a very small part of our referral traffic and third-party agents are a very small subset of that. But I do think that we will find ways to partner. We have to find a way, though, that makes the customer experience good. Right now, I would say the customer experience is not. There's no personalization, there's no shopping history, the delivery estimates are frequently wrong, the prices are often wrong.

So we've got to find a way to make the customer experience better and have the right exchange value. But I do think that the exciting part of this and the promise is that AI and agentic commerce solutions are going to expand the amount of shopping that happens online. And I think that's really good for customers, and I think it's really good for Amazon because at the end of the day, you're going to buy from the outfit that allows you to have the broadest selection, great value and continues to deliver for you very quickly and reliably. And I think that bodes well for us.

And our final question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird.

Colin Sebastian
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I guess first on AWS, following up there. How much of this acceleration is driven by core infrastructure versus AI workload monetization? And I think part of it is trying to understand how important newer services like AgentCore are becoming and bringing enterprises to AWS to build agents? And then I guess, secondly, regarding the acceleration in advertising, if you could potentially disaggregate the core advertising contribution versus DSP and Prime video. That would be helpful as well.

Andrew Jassy
President, CEO & Director

I'll start on the AWS side, we are seeing -- we're really pleased with the results from this quarter, 20% year-over-year on a annualized run rate of $132 billion is unusual. And we have momentum. You can see it. And we see the growth in both our AI area, where we see it in inference. We see it in training. We see it in the use of our Trainium custom silicon. Bedrock continues to grow really quickly. SageMaker continues to grow quickly. And I think that the number of companies who are working on building agents is very significant. I do believe that a lot of the value that companies will realize over time and AI will come from agents.

And I think that building agents today is still harder than it should be. You need tools to make it easier, which is why we built Strands, which is an open source capability that lets people build agents from any model that they can imagine. But even more so, when you talk to enterprises or companies that care a lot about security and scale. They're starting to build agents, and they don't really feel like they've got -- they've had building blocks that allow them to have the type of secure, scalable agents that they need to bet their businesses and their customer experience and their data on.

And that's why -- that was really the inspiration behind AgentCore was to build another set of primitive building blocks like we built in the early days of AWS, where it was compute and storage and database. We defined a set of building blocks that you needed to be able to deploy agents securely and scalably that we provide in AgentCore. And then when we talk to our customers, it really resonates. There is not anything else like it, it's changing their time frame and their receptivity to building agents, and it's very compelling for them.

So I do think the combination of what we're doing to enable agents to be built and run securely and scalably as well as some of the agents that we're building ourselves that our customers are excited about are compelling for them. And I think the other place we see a lot of growth in AWS also is just the number of enterprises who are -- who have gotten back to moving from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud. And we continue to earn the lion's share of those transformations. And I look at the momentum we have right now, and I believe that we can continue to grow at a clip like this for a while.

I think on the advertising side, that is also an area where I think collectively, we feel very pleased about the progress. Every single one of our advertising offerings this quarter grew in a meaningful way. I think there's a few things going on for us. We have what I think of as a pretty unusual full funnel offering. And if you look at the top of the funnel, which typically tends to be awareness building and broad scale to be able to use our own Prime Video and our live sports capabilities as well as going all the way down to the bottom of the funnel at point of sale being able to use sponsored products, that's -- most people don't have a full funnel offering as robust as that. And then when you layer on top of it, the combination of the audience curation and development we can do, along with the advantage measurement, it just all leads to a return on advertising spend is very unusual.

And I think there are multiple places where we can expect to continue to grow. One is in our stores business. I still think if you look at the worldwide market segment share of retail, still 80% to 85% of it lives in physical stores. And that equation is going to flip over time. And I think AI is going to only accelerate that. So I think we have an opportunity -- a significant opportunity still in our existing stores. And then I think video, we've only been at this for a little bit of time, but it's already a very large amount of advertising revenue, and we're still relatively early stage.

I think that will continue to be a big area of growth. And then as you referenced, the amount -- their demand-side platform or Amazon DSP, that is growing really quickly as well. And some of it had to do with the fact that we had some features. We always had a number of the core components people wanted around some of our properties, the measurement capabilities, Amazon Marketing Cloud, but we lack some features for a while as we were building out our DSP that customers told us mattered and the team over the last 20 months have closed those gaps in a very significant way so that now people feel like our DSP is fully featured.

And then you look at some of the partnerships that we've done, the Roku partnership gives us the largest connected TV footprint in the U.S. And you layer on top of that, what we've recently done in providing our DSP customers, the opportunity to integrate with the ad inventory in Netflix and Spotify and SiriusXM, it's powerful. And so we are growing very quickly on the demand side platform. So very optimistic about what we're doing there. We've work to do, obviously, but I don't think we're close to being able to grow there.
