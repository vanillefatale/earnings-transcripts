[Operator Instructions] And the first question today is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley.

Terence Flynn
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. A lot of focus obviously on orforglipron and path to market. I was surprised that it wasn't on the first list of the Commissioner's National Priority Review Voucher program. And so maybe you could just comment on kind of if you guys are seeking that voucher? And then if not, why not? And then how to think about time lines for launch and some of the puts and takes as we think about maybe consensus expectations for 2026.

Mike Czapar
Director of Investor Relations

All right. Great. Thanks for the question, Terence. We'll go to Dave to talk a bit about orforglipron.

David Ricks
Chairman, CEO & President

Thanks, Terence, for the call. I think as we've said before, we're interested in getting orforglipron to as many patients around the world as fast as we can, including those in the U.S. So without commenting on specific vehicles, I think investors can expect us to be pursuing in all of the above strategy to get the medicine out more quickly. Also, I'd point out that if you look at this new voucher program, I think orforglipron checks, at least 3 or 4 of the boxes laid out. So yes, we'll see. It's obviously government decision about which pathway they choose and the review time itself. But we're focused on speed here and we're ready to launch. So the package will go in, in the quarter, and we hope to get approval as soon as we can after that.

The next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.

Christopher Schott
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I just wanted to touch base a bit more on the Mounjaro international ramp. It's obviously had a pretty impressive step up in sales these past 2 quarters. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on how some of these new country launches are trending relative to your expectations? How to think about growth off of this new higher base? And is just there any meaningful stocking as we appreciate kind of look at these numbers? Just a little bit more color on what's been driving this big step-up.

Mike Czapar
Director of Investor Relations

Thanks, Chris. Thanks for the question. On Lilly International, we'll go to Patrik for that to talk a bit about Mounjaro uptake, new country launches, growth.

Patrik Jonsson
Executive VP & President of Lilly International

Thank you very much, Chris. I think we are very encouraged by what we're seeing outside of the U.S. And the business, as we shared earlier, is 75% out-of-pocket and 25% type 2 diabetes. What we have seen is, of course, an initial stocking in those markets where we launched, and we refer to the big ones being in Q2 being China, Brazil, Mexico and India. Since then, we have seen a lift in the performance also in those markets in Q3 and a continued very strong performance globally. Looking forward, I think the major opportunity is, number one, in type 2. We have reimbursement currently in 8 markets, and we'll continue those efforts across all of the U.S. markets, but that's going to take some time.

Secondly, the big opportunity when it comes to obesity is really about patient activation, and we will lean in on all of those efforts also in 2026. When you look at international, it's important to -- while it's one line in the income statement, we are referring to more than 55 countries and there are different market dynamics, different buying patterns. So as we have seen over the last several quarters, it's not going to be a straight line, but there are significant opportunities outside of the U.S. also moving forward across type 2 and chronic weight management.

The next question will be from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim.

Seamus Fernandez
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

So mine is actually on some of the behaviors that we're seeing in the market around M&A and how the competitors' dynamics are playing out and how you, Dave and Dan see the market evolving from here. You've commented on retatrutide, perhaps segmenting the heavier patient population with greater comorbidities. You have orforglipron potentially targeting a maintenance and lower end portion of the market that's massively scalable and you also have tirzepatide kind of blowing the numbers out and potentially cornering the competitor to some degree in other markets. Just wanted to get a sense of if that behavior would be concerning to you, if you don't really spend much time thinking about it because you're so focused on your own business or if there are other considerations as you work to further segment the market and take a deeper leadership position?

Mike Czapar
Director of Investor Relations

Thanks for the very long and involved question there Seamus. I think we'll go to Dan actually to talk about that.

Daniel Skovronsky
EVP, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Research Laboratories & Lilly immunology

Yes, sure. Thanks, Seamus for a good question. Of course, Lilly has been focused on the obesity opportunity for quite some time. We have a very strong R&D engine behind it. I think when you look at where the science leads us and sort of every kind of reasonable or logical target to pursue, we have robust programs against those targets. And in nearly every case, I think we have either a best molecule or first molecule or both, actually. So I like our portfolio. Clearly, the late-stage clinical molecules that the Street is paying attention to, we like where they are. But behind it, I can assure you there's a robust pipeline that we like.

No surprise then that every -- probably just about every other company in this industry looks at that and wants to improve their own position. So that doesn't surprise us. We watch that and of course pay attention but we haven't seen anything that changes our view about the competitiveness of our portfolio or the lead that we have in this space, which we intend to maintain through robust investments, not just in research and development, but as you've seen today, in multiple Phase III trials and new indications.

David Ricks
Chairman, CEO & President

Maybe just to add just I think that -- sorry, Mike, maybe just to add, I think that's a great answer. I think for a long time, we've all been saying we're focused on every logical target and pursuing the full extent of what these medicines can do for various conditions. I mean today's call highlights that with some of the new studies Dan highlighted. But it's also important to note, in addition to innovation, you need to execute. This is a highly scaled business and reaching potentially tens or even hundreds of millions of people. And here also, I think Lilly has really done well.

It's a combination of those 2 things that, I think, built the lead we have. And we are very focused on both of them, both innovation Dan talked about, but also executing with manufacturing build-out, in market performance, new ways to reach consumers. Of course, everybody would like to be in our position, but we're focused on defending it and mostly just executing the play we have. So it's a good question. We'll probably see more dynamics and noise from other pharmaceutical manufacturers, that's normal. What we need to do is run the strategy out that we've outlined. Thanks for the question.

The next question will be from James Shin from Deutsche Bank.

James Shin
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I got one for David. David, you previously mentioned narrowing the gap between list and net pricing. Cigna recently announced drug rebates would be replaced with GPO fees. And it sounds like it's going to lead to greater discounts as well as more employer opt-ins. So does that suggest greater GTM pressure than what you would normally have with rebates? Does this make clinical profiles more relevant to form like positioning or access? Like what kind of changes should we expect?

Mike Czapar
Director of Investor Relations

Great. Thanks, James. We'll go to Dave to talk about some of the recent announcements from PBMs on business model.

David Ricks
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. I think you're talking about the Cigna move, and there's also -- I'd also point out, increasing share in large employer market from kind of nontraditional PBMs, I guess we call them -- I applaud this. I think it's a good move for innovators. It's a good move for patients. It's a good move for payers, for the commercial payers and probably smart of Cigna to make this first move to recoup market share or gain market share. I think that everyone wants more transparency and lower out-of-pocket for patients. And this kind of model will produce both of those. And what we want is to make the basis of competition, one of clinical differentiation that doctors and patients both appreciate in a way, the nontransparent rebates and other behind the scenes activities that determine which medicine a patient gets is not in our interest.

So as an innovator, probably the leading spender on innovation in the sector coming up, we're for this. I think David and his team at Cigna did a good thing here. And we hope others follow and the market in the U.S. can rapidly transition to such a system. I don't think that per se that reads through to some pricing effect. What I hope is that more valuable medicines will have that value recognized in pricing and less valuable medicines will have a harder time competing now because you can't just rebate away some number and find formulary position ahead of a better medicine. So we're for this. And again, it's a good move. Hats off to David Cordani and the team. And hopefully, others rapidly follow.

The next question will be from Geoff Meacham from Citi.

Geoffrey Meacham
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Just had another one on orforglipron. When you guys think about commercial strategy, would you characterize it as more consumer-centric through LillyDirect? Or should we think about it as a more typical pharma launch with PBM and payer negotiations being really critical on day 1. And I guess the puts and takes of both of those.

Mike Czapar
Director of Investor Relations

Okay. Great. Thanks for the question, Geoff. Orforglipron kind of a U.S. bench. So we'll go to Ilya to talk about some of the orfor launch thinking.

Ilya Yuffa
Executive VP and President of Lilly USA & Global Customer Capabilities

Sure, Geoff. Thanks for the question. Obviously, we're excited about the profile of Orforglipron and how to commercialize it in the U.S. and outside the U.S. as well. Obviously, we think about this similarly to how we've viewed Zepbound, where we need to drive great commercial and overall access for patients for accessibility, but we also recognize that there is significant demand in the consumer segment related to finding ways to get outside some of the frictions in the health care system. And so we see both looking at broad coverage as well as looking at expanding how we do our direct-to-consumer platform and ensuring that every patient has the ability to access medicines across the portfolio.

The next question will be from Steve Scala from TD Cowen.

Steve Scala
TD Cowen, Research Division

I know it's Lilly's policy not to comment on interims, but it's also a bit unusual for Lilly to speak about them in some detail. And Lilly has spoken in some detail about the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3 interim on both the Q1 '25 and Q4 '24 calls in likely other forms as well. So with that said, has the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3 interim already been taken? The initiation of remternetug in the same setting would not seem the best sign for donanemab in Alzheimer's prevention.

Mike Czapar
Director of Investor Relations

Well, thanks, Steve, and thanks for the question on Alzheimer's. We'll go to Anne to talk about some of our clinical trials in early Alzheimer's.

Anne White
Executive VP & President of Lilly Neuroscience

Great. Well, thanks for the question. Yes, I think we're all looking forward to these results. As you know, we tend not to comment on interims. As we've shared previously, we have completed enrollment in TRAILBLAZER-3. So now it just continues to be a matter of reaching the sufficient number of events, and this is an event-based trial. In clinicaltrials.gov, we listed date of 2027, though it could be earlier than that. We are pleased, though, and this is what I think we commented on to see momentum and awareness in the space. I think that was really evidenced by the enthusiastic enrollment in our remternetug preclinical study as well.

And as Dan mentioned, what we have the opportunity there is to innovate with a subcu dosing formulation as well as a monthly dosing in a -- and again, in a fixed duration dosing paradigm. So we continue to innovate in the Alzheimer's space, and you'll see us continue to commit to that even as we build on the foundation of a very strong Kisunla performance. There's a couple of things that we're doing right now to make sure that we're ready for this readout, I will mention in preclinical because it does require a few fundamental shifts.

It requires awareness and education on the importance of treating in that earlier stage of disease and the need to be proactive really around brain health. And very importantly, it requires a simple and accessible blood test to make the diagnosis in the preclinical space, which is also referred to as Stage 1 and 2. So there's quite a bit to do. So you'll hear us continue to talk about the readiness work that we need to do to get ready for this readout, but more to come in the future.

Next question will be from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo.

Mohit Bansal
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Congrats on all the progress. I would love to understand or think through your thoughts around evoke trial and GLP, GIPs in general for Alzheimer's disease. How do you think about this space evolving? And could brenipatide the new GLP/GIP be a drug for Alzheimer's given that this has neuro properties?

Mike Czapar
Director of Investor Relations

Great. Thanks, Mohit, for the question about evoke as well as just brenipatide. So we'll go to Dan to take both of those.

Daniel Skovronsky
EVP, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Research Laboratories & Lilly immunology

Yes. Thanks, Mohit. Obviously, we follow this space closely. I think we are leaders in Alzheimer's disease and also leaders in incretin therapy. You correctly point out that brenipatide has got some of the attributes that make us excited about it for use for CNS indications that could be inclusive of Alzheimer's disease, although we haven't laid out any plans there yet. We're sort of on the verge of seeing, I believe, evoke data. That will be very informative. I think given our strength in our portfolio, almost regardless of that outcome, we have opportunities to build there and create something that could potentially be more meaningful for patients. So we'll wait, we'll see that, and then you can expect us to talk in more detail about our next steps.

The next question will be from Courtney Breen from AllianceBernstein.

Courtney Breen
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

I wanted to loop back to orforglipron, which I know has lots of focus on. You seem to be preparing for a very large-scale launch. And by our calculations on the basis of some of the comments you've made, you could have enough doses to support at least 5 million patients for a full year based on the inventory already built. And I think, Dave, you've mentioned kind of this could be the GLP-1 for all. Can you help us understand kind of the potential for expansion to the market with orfo? And should we expect to see a slowdown in getting new starts during the initial period of that orfo launch.

Mike Czapar
Director of Investor Relations

Yes. Courtney, it was a little hard to hear, but I think some of the questions was thinking about how to expand the market for orfo in different indications, different opportunities. So we'll go to Ken to talk a bit about some of our ambitions for orforglipron.

Kenneth Custer
Executive VP & President of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health

Sure, Courtney. Thanks for the question. Now with 6 Phase III studies in hand, I think we really understand the profile of this emerging medicine. It continues to recapitulate the efficacy and safety of injectable GLP-1s. In fact, Dan recapped some of that during the early part of the call, recapping the ATTAIN-2 data, which seemed very consistent with STEP-2 as well as the ACHIEVE-3 data showing superiority versus oral semaglutide. So we think this is a great profile. You're getting glucose benefits, weight benefits, improvements in blood pressure, lipids, inflammatory markers, all that in a simple once-daily pill with no restrictions on food and water and of course, which we can manufacture and distribute at scale.

So we tend to think at a different magnitude about the opportunity here than historically what we've done with incretins. In the United States, there's probably 8 million or 8.5 million people on incretins out of maybe 170 million who might benefit. And globally, that's a much bigger number, probably measured in the high hundreds of millions or even billions. So this is now, I think, the generational opportunity to figure out how to get an incretin to a much larger group of people. We can do that to the simplicity of the profile, which is also easier to manufacture and distribute.

So really, our plan will be about accomplishing that at an international level, getting it out there as quickly as possible. Of course, we're also developing orforglipron in a lot of other settings beyond obesity and diabetes. Dan recapped some of those new NILEX that we've announced. And of course, just to recap as well, we see an opportunity not just as a starter incretin here with orforglipron, but also something that could potentially be used for patients to continue the success they've had with a drug like Wegovy or Zepbound. We're assessing that now in the ATTAIN-MAINTAIN study and look forward to sharing those data later this year.

The next question will be from Asad Haider from Goldman Sachs.

Asad Haider
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Congrats on all the ongoing progress. Just sticking with orforglipron, maybe given it's importance, just a high-level question on pricing and volume dynamics ahead of the launch. So the cash pay channel is where you're continuing to see the most rapid growth in the obesity market. Zepbound vials are now almost 40% of new scripts. And related on ex U.S. price elasticity, you saw a shift in volumes in the U.K. when Mounjaro prices increase.

So I guess what are the learnings from this for the orforglipron ramp next year as it relates to the elasticity of demand across different price points? And I guess my question is specifically related to how you're thinking about U.S. versus OUS volume unlocks for orforglipron as launches -- as it launches in a world of potential MFN equilibrium prices?

Mike Czapar
Director of Investor Relations

Okay. Thanks, Asad. I think we'll -- maybe we'll start with Ilya to discuss some of the U.S. dynamics? And then maybe, Patrik, if you want to make a couple of brief comments about some of the OUS learnings from the U.K. as well.

Ilya Yuffa
Executive VP and President of Lilly USA & Global Customer Capabilities

Yes. Thank you for that question. Obviously, we have experienced significant growth overall in the total market. So we've seen sequential growth in the covered. Overall the sequential growth is 15%. But we're seeing significant more volume go through a direct-to-consumer platform with LillyDirect, which says a lot about, one, what consumers and patients as well as providers see as the benefit of Zepbound in particular and also the ability to remove some of the friction and the ability to have accessibility to medicine. And so we see this channel as a significant channel now and into the future.

And then as part of that, obviously having more offerings, whether you include being able to pick up your Zepbound vial at a local Walmart, which we announced yesterday or expanding the offering on having another treatment like orforglipron. That's an important element for us to expand the ability for patients to get treated. That is the main goal that we have is to improve overall health outcomes, and we have multiple medicines and different platforms to achieve that.

Mike Czapar
Director of Investor Relations

Patrik?

Patrik Jonsson
Executive VP & President of Lilly International

Maybe just a few additions from an OUS perspective. I think, first and foremost, in the U.K. with a raise in price that was effective September 1, I think we learned pretty much what we expected to learn. What we did was just to take the U.K. price at the level of -- raise it to the level of a European price. And even if there were regulations in the U.K., we actually saw export of medicines out of U.K. to other markets. So that has probably stopped with intervention we did put in place.

Secondly, we're also learning something about consumer pricing elasticity. So that exists. But most importantly, I think orforglipron will meet a slightly different need of the marketplace. We know that obesity is a heterogeneous disease. And for people with a BMI below 35 and that might not need a weight loss drug like tirzepatide, we believe there is a significant opportunity in OUS. And also driven by the other features that Ken referred to earlier, the opportunity to scale here and to reach other patient populations and with no need of refrigeration, et cetera. So we see those as being very complementary in the OUS business setting as well.

Operator

Next question will be from Tim Anderson from Bank of America.

Timothy Anderson
BofA Securities, Research Division

I have a question on GLP-1 pricing. So with Novo's sema, we get an IRA negotiated price within the next month. My sense from talking to some industry folks is that, that negotiated price may be more favorable than the investment community is expecting, meaning less degradation to the current net price. And that, of course, would be good for everyone in the space. What is Lilly picking up on this? And whatever that level of discount ends up being, would you agree that it quite likely has a direct impact on pricing of Lilly's own products in 2027? Or do you think sema's negotiated price just won't translate across?

Mike Czapar
Director of Investor Relations

Okay. Thanks for the question, Tim. We'll go to Ilya talk a bit about just some of the broad thinking about sema IRA negotiations acknowledging we're not part of the discussion.

Ilya Yuffa
Executive VP and President of Lilly USA & Global Customer Capabilities

Sure. Thanks, Tim, for the question. Obviously, we're -- we don't know the price is being negotiated at the same time. There are several things that are important to note. One, that it only applies to sema in Part D beginning in 2027. Overall, if you take a look at our volumes, Medicare Part D is a small proportion of our overall volume. Obviously, predominantly in type 2 diabetes since there's lack of coverage in obesity. Probably the most important element to include here is that tirzepatide has demonstrated superior efficacy versus sema in head-to-head trials, which is a strong foundation for any value-based discussions that we have with payers, not only in our data, but you see that as well in provider preference as well as patient preference that you see in the market.

Mike Czapar
Director of Investor Relations

Great. And then Dave, do you want to add a couple of comments?

David Ricks
Chairman, CEO & President

I think he covered it well. Maybe just one thing because we've been talking about orforglipron and its upcoming launch. We think about single-acting GLP-1s as one category and double and triple acting as others. And probably both weight loss and clinical value will be quite different between these medicines. And of course, we're paying close attention to the sema price. But as Ilya said, it's a Part D-only channel. So let's let it all play out. I think we're in a good position because we have so many options.

Operator

The next question will be from Alex Hammond from Wolfe Research.

Alexandria Hammond
Wolfe Research, LLC

Can you walk us through the importance of the upcoming ATTAIN-MAINTAIN trial to orforglipron's commercial opportunity? And is there an outcome that might meaningfully change your view on how quickly orforglipron's launch may scale.

Mike Czapar
Director of Investor Relations

Great. Thanks, Alex, for the question on ATTAIN-MAINTAIN, we'll go to Ken.

Kenneth Custer
Executive VP & President of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health

Sure. Thanks for the question, Alex. on ATTAIN-MAINTAIN. This is a really first of its kind study, and we're looking forward to these data later this year. We took advantage of the opportunity to rerandomize patients for the SURMOUNT-5 study who were maximally tolerated on either semaglutide or tirzepatide and randomized them to orforglipron or placebo, and we're going to measure the percentage of the weight that they lost over the course of 72 weeks that they keep off while taking orforglipron. Of course, this is a first of its kind study. We don't know exactly what the results will be, but we're hopeful that orforglipron will provide a simple once-daily oral option that lets patients keep the majority of their weight off.

And so we think this is really an opportunity to expand the market even further for orforglipron. Of course, we have very bullish expectations for it as a first-line starter incretin, but also this is an opportunity to continue to grow that. I don't think -- as we think about orforglipron, we don't think about sort of cannibalization in that way. This is an opportunity to grow the market at a very different rate, and we think the data from ATTAIN-MAINTAIN could be really just an exciting boost and allow us to have some medical information to disseminate to physicians about how they can help patients switch from drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound. But of course, we also know that all weight management drugs are, of course, indicated for maintenance. So these are just data to help HCPs and patients guide between these medicines.

The next question will be from Umer Raffat from Evercore.

Umer Raffat
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I just wanted to touch up on GLP pricing. And on the one hand, there's a lot of commentary on some of the expectations you've laid out on orforglipron pricing framework. If you could expand on that. But then also, on the other hand, there's a lot of actions and changes at your main competitor over the last few months. And I almost wonder, do you think they will stay a mature player from a pricing front? Or will that no longer be a base case for us?

Mike Czapar
Director of Investor Relations

Great. Thanks, Umer, for the question on GLP-1 pricing. Maybe we'll hear from Lucas to weigh in on those dynamics.

Lucas Montarce
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thank you for the question, Umer. Maybe just thinking about the pricing dynamics when you actually unpack our Q3 performance, you see that actually, our pricing continued to perform as what we expected, right? So I think it's a good data going after the CVS move that we didn't see again, a significant price erosion, but actually was very much in line to what we said early in the year for the full year as well. So maybe just had a good data point that you can take from that perspective. And thinking more broadly about the competition in the marketplace, again, we always pay close attention on the competition in the marketplace, but also how we differentiate both commercially, but also on the level of the product. And Ilya, Dan, Ken mentioning about the differentiation. And you see that in the marketplace.

So if you take, for example, a good proxy that for me is LillyDirect we have been priced over the last maybe 6 months already at that starting point at $349 going to $499 and maintain that price and you see the penetration and the competition is placed at the same level as well. So we don't see materially changing the dynamics that we see from that perspective and as we continue to penetrate the market and mobilize patients to seek more treatment.

Next question will be from Akash Tewari from Jefferies.

Akash Tewari
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

So at the All-In Summit, Dave, you noted if orfo was priced at $100 a month, there'd be no incentive for new medicines in that category to kind of create the next big thing. A few weeks later in Chicago, you mentioned how Lilly has already made billions of doses for orfo and it could have an impact on human health at a global level. Can Lilly achieve both goals of kind of preserving continuous innovation in obesity and having orfo be a drug for hundreds of millions of patients with the parity pricing model between the U.S. and rest of world?

Mike Czapar
Director of Investor Relations

Thanks, Akash. We'll go to Dave to address those 2 comments.

David Ricks
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. Thanks, and thanks for tuning into all my podcasts and public event. So I mean, yes, our strategy is to bridge both. We think, as you're pointing out, that flatter pricing between U.S. and other developed countries is important. But there's like 3 ways that this works. And I think one important thing here that just to point out on all these pricing questions that is different in this GLP-1 category is the consumer self-pay channel. We haven't really seen that at scale in other categories. And it certainly is a channel here, partly because of under insurance, but partly because the benefits of these medicines manifest so consistently. There really aren't that many nonresponders at all and produce a very desirable short-term effect in addition to enhancing long-term health benefits.

It really is a unique situation. So we have seen price elasticity, as was mentioned, and that it's, on the one hand, in our interest to offer consumers a compelling price where they can afford to self-pay. It's also in our interest to continue to build out indications for chronic disease, as Ken and Dan were outlining earlier. And we are committed to doing both, having a strong consumer offering, but also proving the health benefit. And that should not compete for consumer dollars, but for health care dollars, either government or from private payers.

So it's a both end, and I do think these can bridge because we have so much evidence coming of long-term benefit, we should compete with other classes of medicines in chronic diseases or even create whole new classes. And at the same time, we'll probably continue to see consumer self-pay demand, whether it be for prevention or there are other needs. So I think it's entirely possible to do both. And I think Ken mentioned earlier some of the numbers that we are literally just scratching the surface of global treatment here. And there really is a tremendous opportunity to reach tens or even hundreds of millions of more people in the coming years, and that's our goal.

The next question is coming from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets.

Evan Seigerman
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Dan, you recently commented that you were super excited about your presymptomatic Alzheimer's program. I appreciate that you don't want to comment on an interim look, but could you expand on what drives this view and how it has changed since the initiation of the program?

Mike Czapar
Director of Investor Relations

Okay. Great. I double back on the presymptomatic Alzheimer. So we'll go Anne to talk a bit about that.

Daniel Skovronsky
EVP, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Research Laboratories & Lilly immunology

Okay. Thanks, Evan. I apologize, I didn't say super excited on this call. I'm still super excited about the Alzheimer's opportunity here to treat in the preclinical space. The reasons for my excitement go back to the data that we saw actually in TRAILBLAZER-1 and TRAILBLAZER-2. In both of those trials where we're treating symptomatic patients, we saw the largest treatment effect on patients who were the earliest in their disease course, whether you measure early disease course by symptoms or pathology, et cetera, that's where the drug had the biggest effect.

And in fact, we looked at prevention of progression as an outcome in that trial in those patients, we have really profound results. I actually expect the same in TRAILBLAZER-3 as well as TRAILRUNNER-3, which is the trial with remternetug. So I remain extremely excited. No change here at all to my level of enthusiasm or confidence and success.

Mike Czapar
Director of Investor Relations

Great. Thanks. With that, we'll close the Q&A. And Dan -- I go to Dave for you for a couple of closing remarks.
