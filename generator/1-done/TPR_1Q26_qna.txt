[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo.

Irwin Boruchow
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I guess high level, I'd like to start, maybe Joanne. Just can you elaborate more on the drivers of the accelerated growth that you're seeing and really more about the sustainability of the momentum? I know compares are going to start getting more difficult for you come holiday. And really at Coach specifically, what gives you the confidence that you can sustain double-digit revenue growth as you start to cycle those comparisons?

Joanne Crevoiserat
President, CEO & Director

This was a powerful start to our Amplify growth agenda. Our results are clearly differentiated in the market, and I'll start by sending a thank you to our teams who continue to focus on what matters, and that is delighting consumers all around the world. But to comment on the durability of our results overall, the beat and raise that we delivered this quarter reinforces that our advantages are structural and they're sustainable over the long term.

At our Investor Day, we highlighted that we play in an attractive TAM with massive headroom, and we're focused on that new customer acquisition at point of market entry. And as we showed in the first quarter, we're winning with this next generation of consumers, and that's expanding the market. We're taking share, but it's also giving us the opportunity to drive higher lifetime value. And this is compounding. We're seeing increases in both acquisition and retention. And I think that's an important point to note, and we're managing the business for the long term. We're continuing to invest behind these capabilities at scale, which is expanding our competitive moat and it's ensuring that our performance continues well into the future.

But let me turn it to Todd to talk about the durability of the Coach momentum more specifically. Todd?

Todd Kahn
CEO & Brand President of Coach

Thanks, Joanne. Good morning. Let me give you 5 proof points to support my conviction for long-term sustainable growth. They are the key 5 Ps of our business. These Ps are foundational to how we win in our space.

First, it starts with product. The innovation pipeline of our products that our designers and merchants are developing is remarkable. You saw it on display at our most recent fashion show in September, and I have the benefit of seeing our development a year in advance, and it will continue to build on our icon strategy and the product is fantastic.

Second is our people. We are nearly 90% direct-to-consumer, and our people know how to engage our customers on a global scale. A few weeks ago, I participated in our Asian Store Manager Conference. The enthusiasm and shared understanding of our mission and our brand positioning empowers and uplifts our people.

Third is place. Because of our focus on Gen Z, we know that they love to shop in the real world, and our almost 1,000 directly operated stores are the environments to best express the world of Coach. Additionally, we are no longer restricted to only traditional malls and outlets and have the right to win in new locations where Gen Z shop.

Fourth, promotion or marketing. Our purpose-led storytelling resonates with our consumers. In Q1, we spent almost 11% on marketing, a 43% increase in actual dollars from the prior year. Since our marketing activities are primarily focused on customer acquisition, that does not immediately take place in the quarter. This investment future-proofs new customer acquisition.

And finally, price. Our brand position of expressive luxury and the sweet spot of the $200 to $500 range ensures that we have room to grow AURs while maintaining our compelling value proposition. So overall, I feel great about our growth potential. We're just hitting our stride and not only will we comp the comp, but the path to $10 billion is well within our sights.

Our next question is from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan.

Matthew Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats on a great quarter. So Scott, at the Coach brand, 21% revenue growth represented 800 basis points of acceleration on the 2-year stack. I think every single geography accelerated sequentially. So first, can you break down the drivers of the material 2-year inflection this quarter? And then second, is there anything beyond just prudent macro planning that you've embedded in the back half guide, which embeds moderation on that 2-year stack?

Scott Roe
CFO & COO

Yes. Matt, thanks for the question. So first of all, I'd just remind you what Joanne and Todd just said about the structural advantages, the fact that this is a methodical approach to brand building and you see it on display. But maybe I'll give you some numbers behind some of that growth inflection that we saw in Q1. So you're right, we grew 21% in Coach in Q1 and 26% in North America. And we also talked about AUR being up mid-teens.

So what that means is we had a significant inflection in units. And this has been a multi-quarter pattern that we've seen with for a while, we were talking about growth without the units and driven by AUR. We've now seen a meaningful acceleration in units. And I think tying that back to more than 2 million new customers acquired who we know are transacting at higher AURs and driving more transactions in the Coach franchise, that's driving both AUR and unit growth.

And then geographic expansion, right? We grew significantly, as you mentioned, in every one of our major geographies, really led by North America and China, but for the Coach brand, almost 40% in Europe, which is a huge opportunity. So putting those things together, continued AUR growth opportunities, new customer acquisition and an inflection in units, significant geographic growth. That's one of the things that allowed us to take our -- to have a beat and raise, take our guidance up. And remember, we're talking about now double-digit growth on top of double-digit growth 1 year ago, right, based on the guidance we have.

And you asked about the balance of the year. So we're 1 year in, we're 25% through the year. And our biggest quarter of the year is coming up with holidays. So I'll just take you back and remind you how we guided to the year. We looked at what we could see in the current quarter in Q1, and we also looked at the 2-year stack. So our balance of the year is the same approach that we entered this year, which is we're fairly consistent on a 2-year stack.

The reality is in Q1, we saw a significant inflection. And quarter-to-date, we see that trend continue even though it's early in the quarter, we still -- we're not through the peak months in holiday, but we see nothing in our business that gives us any concern. We just feel like 25% of the year, it's prudent to maintain that. Let's get through holiday. We'll come back. We'll reevaluate and we'll give you guys an update on the picture for the balance of the year.

Todd Kahn
CEO & Brand President of Coach

I know you asked the question for Scott. I will tell you, our brand is one of -- we say what we do and we do what we say. We said that in our Investor Day. And we tend to have a conservative outlook. But I want to reinforce that as the person running the brand, as Scott said, we feel very good about our positioning, where we're at, what we're seeing in the quarter. We're the first quarter in, we're a team way ahead, but we got a lot of game to still play. So that's how we prepare you, but I feel very good about where we're at.

Our next question is from Alex Straton of Morgan Stanley.

Alexandra Straton
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Perfect. I just wanted to focus quickly just on the gross margin pieces in the year. So it looks like you're assuming gross margin falls a bit after expansion in the first quarter. Can you just walk through kind of the puts and takes and the factors there and the shape if there's a difference from 2Q to 4Q?

And then maybe just one for Joanne, just on industry trends. I think some experts are calling for a luxury resurgence. So just curious how you think about any implications for your business there or maybe what you're focused on from just an industry dynamics perspective?

Scott Roe
CFO & COO

Yes, Alex, I'll start on your specific gross margin question. So first of all, this is very consistent the way we've guided our gross margin, our understanding of the cost of tariffs are -- we've got our arms around that. It's essentially unchanged. I'll remind you, we're making progress, and we just took our gross margin guidance up by 20 basis points for the year, very strong performance in the first quarter. So we continue to make progress against the impact of tariffs and have great confidence in our ability to grow our gross margins as we go into '27.

And I'll remind you, even this year, with those tariff pressures, we're growing our operating margins. So if you look at the second half, about 2/3 of the pressure versus last year is tariff related. Again, that's not new news. That's unchanged. And there's a little bit of noise on tax based on some timing issues in the second half.

Joanne Crevoiserat
President, CEO & Director

And I'll pick up the second part of your question, Alex. Our business is strong and growing. And we've been growing through what I would call a dynamic landscape. So to your point, what we're seeing in the in the background or in the market more generally is that the category, the handbag category inflected to growth in the last quarter. And so there is a more constructive backdrop developing, particularly in places like China, where we saw it also inflect to growth with 1% growth in the market, we estimate.

And we welcome a more constructive environment, but that doesn't define our actions. We laid out a very compelling plan going forward and how we're building our business with this strong -- building on the emotional connection consumers have in the category, but building those emotional connections to our brands. And that's what's driving and powering our growth. You saw us grow through really difficult when the market was down. We were putting up substantial growth, and we're continuing to outperform the market very consistently.

So we're seeing a customer who is resilient -- they are being choiceful and cautious as we've talked about before, but they're active around the world. And where we're delivering innovation and emotion, we are winning. And again, that's success attracting more young consumers to the brand. They're coming in, in a healthy way. And we're actually seeing them come back with more frequency. Our retention rates are higher among Gen Z, but they're also higher and growing in non-Gen Z cohorts.

And Coach is really firing on all cylinders. Maybe I'll toss it to Todd to give you some color on how he's thinking about the market and our growth going forward.

Todd Kahn
CEO & Brand President of Coach

Thanks, Joanne. I'd like to say we play our own game. We're happy to see the category grow. That's why we love this category. It's the durability of it is fantastic. 1% globally, but we grew 21%. North America, we grew 26%. We think the category grew 4%. And it's exactly what Joanne said. It's about bringing new customers into the category. And we're achieving this incredible top line growth at some of our best margins in history. I had to go back 20 years, and I still couldn't find a better first quarter overall than what we delivered. So the good news is we're playing our own game. We love our brand positioning. We're bringing in new customers into the brand. That's how we're going to keep winning.

Our next question is from Adrienne Yih of Barclays.

Adrienne Yih-Tennant
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Let me add my hearty congratulations to the entire team throughout. Joanne and Todd, kind of more of a kind of thematic question on the European market. Europe has historically been kind of extremely discerning, hard to penetrate. You really seem like you're at kind of a tipping point in the positive direction. Todd, what is going on in terms of kind of the brand positioning, the younger audience? And how much of the marketing are you spending in Europe? What's the kind of potential kind of penetration there?

And then, Scott, can you just kind of talk about Kate's merchandise margin progress, excluding the tariff impact? We seem to have seen some stabilization in promotional activity, at least at the markdown side of things. I'm wondering if that's an accurate reflection of the merch margin there.

Todd Kahn
CEO & Brand President of Coach

Great. Thanks for the question. You're right. We've seen to materially inflect in Europe, and I love seeing that 39% growth in the quarter. And what's really working is what's working globally. Our value proposition and our purpose campaigns are cutting through. And again, what I said earlier, we're playing our own game. We're not just chasing a traditional European model. We are building this through customer acquisition, youth, incredible value. We're opening stores, not just on high streets where we look for adjacencies. We're building it digitally. We're building it where the customer is.

So we feel very good. We have a lot of potential in Europe. And again, we're doing it at fantastic margins. So I feel -- I don't want to give you how big is big yet, but we feel very good about where we're going and the opportunities. And what I often say is a great bag is a great bag, and it's a great bag in London, Shanghai or New York.

Scott Roe
CFO & COO

Adrienne, I'll address your question on Kate Spade. I'm glad that you asked it that way because, yes, we're taking care to reduce discounting in the Kate Spade brand. We know that has an impact on the top line, but we also know that's the formula for long-term sustainable growth. So we are making progress. We're early days. And when you look at the margin pressure, it's really 2 things, right? It's the tariffs, which were even more disproportionately an impact at Kate, and it's, frankly, the investments we're making in customer engagement and all of these factors together are focused on long-term growth at Kate.

Our next question is from Michael Binetti of Evercore.

Michael Binetti
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I want to ask you on the AUR versus units. You touched on this a little bit. Thanks for the detail. It was notable that this was the first quarter where the units really seem to have inflected relative to the total growth at Coach, 21% for Coach, mid-teens AUR. As you build to the rest of the year, should -- and the comments that you gave us for the rest of the year, Scott, should we think about continuing that wider spread of Coach total growth AUR, so a similar big unit spread like that? Is that -- and is that truly incremental upside to the revenue that you were planning earlier in the year?

And then I'd love to just ask on Kate Spade. What's driving the sequential improvement in North America? I thought it was notable that you just said you are accelerating revenues there while reducing promos a little bit. How long does that promotional holdback continue? Is there a scenario where Kate North America could return to positive quarter this year?

Scott Roe
CFO & COO

Yes. I would say, tactically on the first question, we've said as part of our guidance that we expect a balance between AUR and units. I would say that the magnitude of the inflection in Q1 is significant and is a good indicator of the potential for improved outlook on the second half. So it's a very encouraging sign that points in the right direction. We haven't fully baked in that level of inflection for our guide, but should that continue, then that would be a good thing for us.

Joanne Crevoiserat
President, CEO & Director

And on Kate, Michael, the actions to reset the brand are underway. Our focus is on resetting our foundation for durable and profitable growth going forward. As you noted, reducing our discounting footprint is an important part of that. And where we focused our strategy and investments this quarter, we did drive progress. We saw a lift in consideration from our fall campaign. We saw improvement in Gen Z acquisition trends driven by handbags. And our handbag blockbusters are outperforming at higher AUR.

And importantly, we are seeing an improvement in full price sell-through as well, and that's helping with the improvement. But we know turnarounds take time. And so we are confident in our path forward. We expect to deliver sequential improvement in the back half of this fiscal year, while holiday will be impacted by our reduction of discounting. And then a return. We expect to return to profitable growth in fiscal year '27.

Our next question is from Bob Drbul of BTIG.

Robert Drbul
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Just a couple of questions on the product side. Just the footwear business in Coach and then the Charms business, are those consistent globally as well? Just curious on the penetration with both of those categories.

Todd Kahn
CEO & Brand President of Coach

Bob, thank you. Yes, is the short answer. We -- our more mature markets, China and North America, we have more space for footwear. And -- but we're seeing particularly our focus on sneakers is winning globally, and it's winning across both genders. So we feel very good about that. And the long-term value of that customer acquisition, we know if they come to the brand through footwear, we tend to get them as a multiple purchase across multiple categories. So we love that. We love the bag charms.

You'll see us have a fulsome presentation for the holidays, everything from the beloved cherry to our plushie bag charms, whether it's a mini Rexy, a carrot or other things that I don't fully understand, but the young consumer does, which is much more important. So we feel very good about those add-ons, and they're meaningful. And what we love about it is while it may not always be a UPT driver at the point of sale when they buy the bag, they're often coming back a week or 2 later to buy the charm to buy something else. So that gives us another bite at the apple. And what I love is our salespeople know how to convert if we get them back a second time.

Our next question is from Aneesha Sherman of Bernstein.

Aneesha Sherman
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

I want to dig into the topic of AURs a little bit more and more focused on the short term. So you did -- you've talked about the long-term opportunity to keep raising AURs at your Investor Day, and that makes sense. But more short term, you did a mid-teens AUR raise led by North America specifically, and now North America is coming up against those tougher compares with mid-teens for Q2 to Q4. I know you don't specifically target AUR, but how are you thinking about the risk of that AUR growth in North America starting to moderate into these tougher compares and more difficult consumer sentiment environment?

And then perhaps the second part of this, perhaps for Scott. AUR is the single biggest driver of your gross margin guidance. So if you were to see that AUR growth come in a little bit lower than expected, are there other levers on margin that you can lean on to maintain your margin guidance? Or could it be a risk to gross margins as well?

Joanne Crevoiserat
President, CEO & Director

Maybe I'll kick it off, Aneesha, and start with just the big picture here. Our AUR growth is driven from our understanding of the consumer, the balance of magic and logic. There are a lot of factors that go into our ability to drive this AUR growth. The creativity that our teams are bringing, it's not just knowing the consumer, but it's what you do with that information and bringing the creativity together, understanding the consumer and delivering incredible innovation into the marketplace is driving our AUR growth. Also, what's driving it is our ability to step away from discounting and the way we use data to make better, higher-quality decisions contributes to our better management of inventory, which contributes to a cleaner presentation for the consumer, and they start to build on each other.

So that is the more functional, I guess, description of our AUR growth and the disciplines that underpin our AUR. Maybe I'll send it over to Todd to talk about the more emotional, the magic side of the business and how we're thinking about driving AUR growth, both from the innovation we're delivering, but also how we're managing the brand across channels. Todd?

Todd Kahn
CEO & Brand President of Coach

Thanks, Joanne. And Joanne, really focused on the big drivers. The only -- and it is an emotional business, and we have that opportunity to continue to engage emotionally with our customer. One of the structural changes here, which we talked about at our Investor Day that is going to be a driver for AUR even when we comp the comp in a meaningful way is our One Coach strategy. Remember what we introduced, we talked about bringing collection product into some of our largest stores globally.

So if we can get them, and we're seeing it win, we're seeing the consumer trade up because the consumer comes in, whether it's a Woodbury Common, at Sawgrass, Bicester Village, they want to come. And when they're in those magnificent outlet stores that have the service levels of any Coach store globally, they want to buy the Tabby bag. They want to buy Brooklyn and they're buying them. So that has a wonderful effect of lifting our overall AUR globally.

Additionally, as something Joanne highlighted, we are far less promotional than ever before. And that raises the floor. So we don't have to give up the sweet spot of that $200 to $500 to still have massive AUR growth in the quarters and years to come. What we have to do is just do what we're delivering now. On Coach, lower discounting, continue to innovate.

Scott Roe
CFO & COO

Yes. And I think, Aneesha, you had a question for me about margin, sustainability of AUR, et cetera. So first of all, just an observation, this is a team that really is focused on gross margin in case you haven't noticed. This is the vernacular of our organization. We talk about it a lot and growth is #1, but gross margin is right behind it. And I think you see that in the results. And we're looking at it very carefully. And a question we frequently get asked is kind of the opposite side of this is given the size of the AUR, should we even take more? I'd say we're getting it pretty right. When you look at the inflection of units and a 15% or mid-teens AUR growth, we're looking very carefully and listening to our consumers, they ultimately decide what they're going to pay. And I think we're getting it fairly right, right?

When you look at the inflection of the business, we're finding ways to grow AUR, but we're also growing units. This is our moment, right? We're grabbing significant share, and we're looking at this very carefully. So do we have other levers? Yes, we do. We didn't even talk about AUC. We've got the best supply chain in the business. We're always fighting for cost opportunities very closely with the merchants and the brand teams, and we are finding those opportunities, right? we're driving efficiency throughout the business.

So we have a lot of levers to protect our gross margin over time. But the most important thing is making sure that what Todd mentioned, that value equation that the consumer sees and is relating to is in balance and that we're delivering innovation and superior product, which they're willing to pay for it. That's number one, and that's the thing that we're maniacally focused on right now.

Our next question is from Brooke Roach of Goldman Sachs.

Brooke Roach
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Joanne, Scott, Todd, I was hoping you could speak to customer acquisition and retention that you're seeing across various income cohorts. Are you seeing the same strength with a value-sensitive customer across the portfolio, particularly in outlets beyond the success that you're seeing in the collection strategy?

Joanne Crevoiserat
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Great question, Brooke. I know on everybody's mind. And what's been powerful about our model is we are seeing strong customer acquisition, strong retention across not only Gen Z, but all age groups, and we're not seeing any meaningful difference between income cohorts and the performance of our business and our brands. So the platform that we have, we reach a broad cross-section of consumers with our brands, and we're winning with all consumers right now.

Operator

Our next question is from Mark Altschwager of Baird.

Mark Altschwager
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I wanted to follow up on the One Coach topic. Just any more color that you can share on the performance of the collection product in outlet? Where is that mix? Where do you think it can go? And just relatedly, on the real estate pipeline, just given the One Coach initiatives here, maybe speak to where you see the opportunity regionally and how you're thinking about different store formats.

Todd Kahn
CEO & Brand President of Coach

Great. We're really pleased. I mean we're only about a year in to introducing for the first time last summer -- a year ago summer, we introduced Tabby in some outlets. Today, it's more than just Tabby. It's really talking about the full lifestyle of Coach. So you see us then followed up with One Coach strategy in sneakers. You're going to see us do similar things with some of the tertiary categories. Jewelry this spring will become more and more One Coach price points. So you're going to see us penetrate quite substantially. I don't want to put a number out there yet. Let's deliver it, but we feel very good that this is going to be a meaningful contributor to growth.

On real estate, what we said to you in September at our Investor Day is we see a lot of growth coming from international. 70% of our future growth is going to come from international. We have inorganic growth, particularly in China. We're going to launch probably close to 100 stores in the next 3 years. Remember, Scott, forewarn, if you model it, these are going to be some smaller format stores. But what I love about our strategy, which is very different from our historic norms is this idea, we have the right to win in places and neighborhoods and locations we had never played before. And that's a global phenomenon.

So you're going to see us introduce stores and new store formats and food and beverage, particularly Coach coffee shops and outlets. Those are all going to be incremental to our growth, and we're going to do a lot of experimenting. But one thing you can bank on from this team, we fundamentally -- and I think Joanne and I both said this 4 or 5 years ago, we believe that stores are profit centers, not marketing activities. So our stores are going to open. They're going to be profitable. They're going to be engaging and they're going to attract a new consumer.
