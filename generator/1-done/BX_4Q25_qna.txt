We will take our first question from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.

Craig Siegenthaler
BofA Securities, Research Division

Our question is on the record IPO pipeline. So what sectors and industries will you be leaning into? Will some of that spill over into real estate? Or is it too early? And as you hand limited partners cash back at a blended MOIC of 2x. Can you talk about the second order effect it will have on fundraising as LP liquidity profiles rebound?

Jonathan Gray
General Partner, President, COO & Director

Thanks, Craig. I would say it will be mostly concentrated in the corporate space just because, obviously, the fundamentals there are strong, the market is open. I think it will be broad-based. But obviously, there is a lot of focus around energy and electricity and some of the picks and shovels around that. But in general, as we saw with Medline, high-quality companies are getting a good reception I do think it will be more U.S. focused, but I think we'll do a number of things in India, and that's a place where we'll see probably more real estate activity as well just because of the underlying health of that economy and that IPO, market. Europe is slower, but it feels broad-based to us and getting better.

And as I said on TV a little earlier, it feels like 2013, '14, where you had that 4-, 5-year hibernation period, the markets reopened, and we took a bunch of companies public. And that's the way it feels today and the fact that Medline and Legence and a couple of companies we've taken out have performed so well for shareholders. I think that's a very good sign. So we do have a lot of confidence.

In terms of what it means for our customers, yes, as they get capital back, as they get gains back and makes it easier for them to allocate more capital to us, it does get that flywheel going again. This is a very positive sign. I think we forget some time that the last 4 years has been in the abnormal period. That M&A and IPO activity have been well below historic levels, and we're moving back towards more historic level of activity, and it is a very positive sign for our business. It helps, obviously, with transaction fees, it delivers returns.

Generally, we're putting these things out at higher levels and carrying value it gives the investors more capital in their pockets to redeploy. So it's a very good virtuous cycle for us, and we're excited to see the IPO market coming back like it is.

We'll take our next question from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.

Michael Cyprys
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I just wanted to ask about AI. You guys are obviously big investors in data centers and AI infrastructure. But just curious how you're deploying AI across your portfolio companies, what learnings you've had along the way, what sort of impact you're seeing from this deployment? And how do you see this evolving over the next 12 to 24 months?

Jonathan Gray
General Partner, President, COO & Director

Well, it's still early days, but we are starting to see some real impact. I'd say at the Blackstone level, it's been with our software engineers. That's where we've seen the biggest impact day 1 in terms of making our folks twice as efficient when they're coding. We're beginning to use it for cyber monitoring, which is giving us a productivity boost. We invested in a company called Norm Ai to help us on the legal side, particularly marketing compliance.

And then I would say data summarization is super helpful. We have 270 companies, 13,000 pieces of real estate and the ability to get that real time and to use that information to make us better investors to me, that is hugely important. At our portfolio companies, I would say customer engagement, we have a number of companies who are doing that. Content creation, certainly with the media-focused companies there. Rules-based businesses, again, legal accounting, transaction processing.

We're working with some of the LLM companies on how to accelerate this and so it feels to us like real productivity gains will come. It's not happening immediately, but we're seeing early test cases that are quite positive. This is one reason I'm optimistic about what can happen to earnings overall in the stock market and certainly across our portfolio companies.

So we want to be really leaders in this space. We hired Rodney Zemmel, who ran AI at McKinsey to help with this, and it is a huge focus for our firm.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Bill Katz with TD Cowen.

William Katz
TD Cowen, Research Division

Just curious, just coming back to the retail opportunities, certainly appreciate the big picture and your market share. One of the biggest pushbacks is, as rates continue to work their way lower, the relative appeal of income-oriented vehicles is going down. So I was wondering, a, what are you hearing on the evolution of -- in the wealth market, and how would you be positioned if that trend were to continue?

And maybe you could break that down in terms of maybe fleshing out your activity level you mentioned in your prepared remarks for '26 and what it might mean for products, geography or incremental distribution opportunities.

Jonathan Gray
General Partner, President, COO & Director

Thanks, Bill. I think the place to start, of course, is the breadth of offerings we have. So one of the great things about our firm is, we obviously have income -- we have products that are incoming growth, and we have growth oriented products show the fact that we have a very large-scale private equity vehicle. We've got just starting out infrastructure vehicle. We have real estate. Obviously, we have credit as well. That's powerful if investors start to shift a little bit.

But I think it's worth noting that I think the appeal of, let's say, private credit is not just about absolute returns. It's also very much around relative returns and the return premium we can generate. So in the fourth quarter, our institutional investors in credit we had record fundraising with them because of that premium, both in noninvestment grade and investment grade.

And if you think about when we started, for instance, BCRED, base rates were close to 0 at that point, and yet we had significant flows. So the key to us, and if you look at what we've done in direct lending, let's say, over 20 years, we've consistently outperformed what the leverage loan and high-yield market offers, that's why I think these products can continue to do quite well.

Yes, there may be a little less demand for these at the margin because of lower absolute rates in the wealth channel, although the institutional clients are actually leaning more into this space now. And at the same time, obviously, equity-oriented products benefit in a meaningful way, lower rates.

And I think one of the great things about our firm is we have the ability to capture that benefit across a wide range of equity products and things we own, both on the individual investor side and the institutional side.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Jon, I was hoping you could unpack a little bit what's going on in direct lending, both on the wealth side and the institutional side. On the one hand, obviously, we saw redemptions pick up, not surprisingly last quarter gross sales on Gen 1 looks like they slowed down a little bit in BCRED still. So what's the sentiment from advisers? How long do you think this will continue on the wealth side of things?

And then importantly, it looks like on the institutional, it's been almost the opposite where your fundraising dynamics on direct lending and the direct lending side are quite strong. So help us understand kind of both of those markets as we stand today.

Jonathan Gray
General Partner, President, COO & Director

Well, Alex, you characterized it well. On the institutional side, way they're looking at the fundamentals and it's not the headlines and some of the noise here is not as impactful. Their confidence in what we're doing and their need in many ways, is going up. So if you think about it on the insurance side, the fact that investment-grade credit is at 71 basis points, corporate investment-grade credit, which is the tightest level since 1998.

The fact that we can bring our insurance clients an extra 180 basis points, which is what we did in 2025, obviously motivates them in this area. And similarly, as rates come down, on the noninvestment-grade side, they still see the benefit of the incremental yield because of our farm-to-table model that we can bring them as investors directly up to borrowers without all the origination, securitization, financing friction. And so that's helpful.

On BCRED wealth specifically, the numbers are, as you know, we raised $14 billion in BCRED last year in the fourth quarter, was $3.3 billion despite the noise. We did see this uptick in redemptions, which is not a surprise given all the headlines out there, although, of course, it's very different than what we're seeing on the ground in reality.

Yes, there will be losses in noninvestment-grade credit. The key, of course is, is your portfolio healthy. Last year, we saw actually high single-digit growth in the EBITDA of our borrowers. The loan to values are sub-45%, and rates are coming down. So the credit metrics are healthy.

The key remains can we deliver a durable premium to what you can get in liquid credit and that we feel very confident. In terms of sort of outlook, we'll have to wait and see on the redemption front, over time. But I think performance will be a key driver here on that. And on inflows, I think it's notable that the last 2 months despite all of this, we've had $800 million of gross inflows each of the last few months in excess of that. So we have a lot of confidence in the portfolio and the outlook over time despite these headlines.

We'll go next to Glenn Schorr with Evercore.

Glenn Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

So maybe a little more of a -- you know what I'm going to go with the management fee questions, sorry. So I think we in consensus have that flattish near-term management fee growth that you talked about, but we also have a ramp in '26 and it ramps up even more in '27. So I guess I'm looking for you to talk to when about you see the ramp and the why, meaning how much and when do you -- is it about the deployment of all the dry powder? How much do you see fee holiday running off and helping in over the next couple of quarters?

Michael Chae
CFO & Vice Chairman

Sure. Well, look, overall, I think as I outlined in my remarks, you have this picture of overall strength and in the private equity credit and BXMA segment, 17% base management fee growth in the fourth quarter year-over-year, you have that really entering the year with significant momentum in those areas, put a little more context around that in sort of the shape of the year in the period ahead that you said, first, we have talked about our new drawdown fundraising cycle that is underway.

We're actively fundraising for 5 PE drawdowns, among others. We're targeting over $50 billion for those in aggregate where we expect it will be materially larger than their respective predecessors in aggregate. And following what we expect to be the commencement of irrespective of -- investment periods in the first half of the year and then file -- at different lengths, we expect all 5 to be fee earning by year-end. Second I'd say you have the continued seasoning and expansion of perpetual strategies overall. Perpetual capital is 48% of our fee earning AUM, that's up 18% year-over-year.

You have this quite impressive scaling in BXPE. You have BXM just entering its second year, coming off holiday. Obviously, our BIP area, new products coming. And then overall, from a business line standpoint, this strong momentum in credit insurance across channels and really broadening diversity fee earning AUM in that area, up 19%. And I talked about real estate in my remarks.

So fundamentally, we're on this upward trajectory. We feel really good about our positioning. I just commented on sort of the shape of some of these major new drawdowns and sort of the timing of fundraising closes, launches and fee holidays. And so you will see that upward ramp in contribution in the course of the year and then full year contribution next year.

And I would note, in this year, you also will have full year contribution of a couple newer drawdown funds like the second growth fund, the life sciences fund. And so you have those embedded components around the overall picture.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.

Daniel Fannon
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

So Michael, maybe just to follow up on that in the context of all that growth, how you're thinking about FRE margin and the potential for expansion in 2026?

Michael Chae
CFO & Vice Chairman

Sure. Look, I think as this past year illustrated, we think our margin position is fundamentally strong. They expanded over 100 basis points to a fiscal year record in the context of record FRE and we do always sort of advise people to look at the full year. And as it relates to 2026, in terms of drivers to note, as we've said before, there's a level of sensitivities to flippers and transaction fees.

And we think the setup for both of those are quite strong entering the year. On operating expenses, we had previously outlined a path of a decelerating rate of growth for 2025, and that is what happened. And we feel good about the continuation of that trend over time. All of this in the context of quite healthy expected top line revenue. So at this stage in the year, you've heard me say it before, we would view the starting point again as margin stability with the potential for upside. So that's what I would sort of leave you with here in January.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.

Brian Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Great. Those last 2 questions were similar to mine. Maybe if I can extend it to '27 just because the ramp-up happens more in the back half of the year, especially with the turn on of the various private equity funds and fee holidays. So looking at base management fee growth of probably 11%-ish or similar in '26 to '25, again, just because the ramp is happening in the back half. But as we get into '27, does that portend an inflection point upward, back to base management fee growth rates that are closer to what we saw in the '20 to 2022 cycle, versus low double-digit side?

And then also, if I can layer in the FRE margin question for '27. Is it fair to assume that you -- if you have that accelerating revenue growth. Obviously, it depends on flippers. But can you continue to scale that for FRE margin improvement in '27? And is there any ceiling you're thinking about for FRE margin in that context?

Michael Chae
CFO & Vice Chairman

Thanks, Brian. I would say, overall, as you're hearing, we feel quite good about 2026, and we feel really good about 2027, just overall across the business from a fee-related earnings standpoint, from a -- as part of that fee-related performance revenues with obviously, the infrastructure, every 3-year large incentive fee happening late that year.

With transaction fees over the next couple of years. Around net realizations, certainly, if this sort of market cycle we see continues and with margins as well. So without getting too granular, certainly for a couple of years from now, that's the overall picture. And structurally and in terms of the kind of timing of those new fundraises I mentioned and the fact that they'll contribute full year fees in 2027 and the other factors and yes, around operating leverage, we feel quite good about it.

Operator

We'll go next to Mike Brown with UBS.

Michael Brown
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So in light of the DOL's proposed rules facilitating the alts in 401(k) plans last week, I just wanted to check in and see if you had kind of an updated view on how the market could start to open up and if you're expecting anything in 2026.

And then just on a related note, where does the alliance with Vanguard and Wellington sit today, is there any new developments to share on that front?

Jonathan Gray
General Partner, President, COO & Director

So on the 401(k) front, we obviously have to wait and see what the administration put out. There's a rule-making process, so I would expect '26 as a year of sort of building and hopefully, the rules coming out. And I think you'll begin to see capital raising more in '27 on the 401(k) side.

I do think that if we get a favorable outcome here that allows private assets to move into American Workers Savings Program, I do think long term, it has a very significant potential. And obviously, for us, as the largest player with the biggest products, that it positions us quite well and obviously, the strength of our brand also.

So -- it's something we're very focused on. We have an excellent team and leadership group on it, but it's something that's going to build, and I see this as sort of a foundational year.

On the Vanguard, Wellington front, there's not a lot I can say. I do think that we will hopefully be launching products this year in the first half of the year. I'm not sure I can go much beyond that. But to me, it speaks to just what's happening to alternatives and the fact that in the wealth channel, they continue to spread out, and we're hopeful that we can reach a broader audience beyond sort of very top end of potential clients, wealth advisers.

And there are a lot of people, I think, interested in these products, particularly if we can make them easier to access. And so I would just say, overall, in wealth and individual investors that the firm's brand and the performance we've delivered is pretty extraordinary. And that this is an area where I think there is lots and lots of -- overall, lots and lots of opportunity. We've been at it for many years. We did our first drawdown product going back to 2002.

We did our first semi-liquid perpetual now 9-plus years ago with BREIT and we built up a lot of goodwill in this channel. And I think you will continue to see new products come online, we filed something in the hedge fund area as well, recently. I think you'll see us continue to deliver for these customers and continue to expand. And what's nice about this AUM, as you know, is this, it's in this perpetual format, it tends to stick for long periods of time and compounds. So we have a lot of optimism and it's on multiple fronts within this wealth and retirement area.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Brennan Hawken with BMO.

Brennan Hawken
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

In the perpetual wealth management strategies, what does the AUM base look like across geographies, particularly interested in what the exposure is as far as Asia goes, Asian investors. And it would be great if you could to give that breakdown by asset class?

Jonathan Gray
General Partner, President, COO & Director

I don't know if we have that handy, what I would say is the vast majority of the capital comes from the U.S. And within Asia, I think the next biggest market for us globally is Japan, which is a market that obviously has long-term stickiness.

And then we've had recent great success in Canada. We do have an investment base in Hong Kong and Singapore, and we're spreading out around the globe, but it continues to be a U.S.-dominated business with Japan now a strong #2 for us.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Brian McKenna with Citizens.

Brian Mckenna
Citizens JMP Securities, LLC, Research Division

So just a bigger picture question for me. As Blackstone has become bigger and bigger over the years, I mean, there's been some questions from time to time around your ability to keep generating strong outperformance. But if you look at your results over the past year, I think you could argue that fundamentals are only accelerating here and then performance across most of the businesses is only getting better.

I think this is a great example of why scale is so important in the industry. But as the company continues to grow from here, how do you make sure you continue to deliver for your investors and then also make sure you're preserving your culture across the firm.

Jonathan Gray
General Partner, President, COO & Director

It's a great question. I would say we have a fair strive at this place that starts with Steve at the top and a desire to deliver for our customers. The reason we've grown so much over 40 years is because we haven't lost sight of true north, which is delivering returns for our customers. And so for us, what we're utilizing is the enormous scale advantages in terms of insights coming from our companies, our real estate and infrastructure and translating that into deployment of capital.

And so you've seen this thematic push into AI infrastructure, both digital and energy infrastructure. You see this in geographically, the big focus we've had in India probably is the leading foreign investor there in private equity and real estate. Our push into Japan as well, which has paid off for us so well in Asia overall. Our focus on secondaries and GP stakes and our knowledge of alternatives using that to translate into terrific returns.

Obviously, our enormous scale in real estate, which is a competitive advantage. And in credit, doing this on an asset-light basis just based on our relationships with clients and the ability to write these very large checks allows us in our minds and in the numbers to outperform.

So I know everyone's always like, larger, it's worse. I think in this environment, having more scale and more data is a meaningful moat and we are trying to capitalize that for our investors each and every day.

There is a very much of an entrepreneurial spirit in this place. There is a fair sense of urgency and desire and will to win and none of that is going away. And so I think the key thing to look at is we raised $71 billion of inflows in the quarter, $239 billion in a year in what has still been a pretty tough environment, real estate lagging, the M&A and IPO markets not quite open yet and look at what we're doing.

So we think the future as the world normalized cost of capital comes down, you have what's happening in the AI world, economy growing faster, productivity picking up and us investing in sectors we really like. We think that we'll really get this flywheel going, which is why you hear this optimism on the call.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Ben Budish with Barclays.

Benjamin Budish
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I wanted to follow up on some of the discussion on the exit environment. I hear the optimism around the IPO opportunity in particular. But just curious if you could comment a little bit on what you're seeing regarding financial and strategic sponsor-backed M&A. What does that mean for the near-term pipeline? I think your commentary about the ramp is more predicated on the IPO cycle just taking some time, despite the growing pipeline. But how are you thinking about other types of M&A, what should we expect maybe in the next couple of quarters? How should we be thinking about that?

Jonathan Gray
General Partner, President, COO & Director

Well, the strength in the stock market is certainly helping. We announced a defense contracting business that we sold in the fourth quarter, which was -- maybe it was early this year, maybe in the last couple of weeks, archive that we sold, and that was from a strategic.

We do see strategics now given the strength of their stocks and the fact that the regulatory environment is much more conducive for M&A, there's more confidence as we've sort of normalized the approach in terms of evaluating antitrust issues, that's been very helpful.

So I would expect a mix. IPOs are obviously helpful for a number of these companies. But I think we will see strategics. There was an announcement this week on the stake side, where a large manager bought a smaller credit manager that we had a stake in, again, that reflects an M&A environment that's improving. So I think it's fair to say it's on both sides.

And then on real estate specifically, we did see a 21% increase in overall M&A activity in real estate. We talked about the strength in logistics. We've seen some of the stocks on the screen start to pick up. I would not be surprised as you start to get momentum in that space, particularly as you move towards the latter half of the year, you'll see a pickup there as well.

So we did lean a lot into the IPO story, but I do think M&A and strategic sales will be there, and they'll continue to be financial buyers for some assets as well.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.

Steven Chubak
Wolfe Research, LLC

So I wanted to ask on the outlook for ECRED flows. You cited the $700 million of equity raised in 4Q. Those flows appear to be accelerating. I was hoping you could speak to what the reception has been for the product? How you're approaching marketing the offering given just a more complex regulatory apparatus in Europe? And as you think about your North Star, whether BCRED is a reasonable paradigm to anchor to as you think about how much this could scale over a longer horizon?

Jonathan Gray
General Partner, President, COO & Director

Well, we're excited about the ECRED product. Direct lending in Europe is a compelling area. The spreads are wider. The loan to values are lower. We've had a product that has delivered 10% inception-to-date returns in a lower rate economy in Europe. It is a harder place to distribute product because of the regulatory matrix that exist in Europe, but we are beginning to get more and more traction.

Some of the new structures that have come out in the U.K. and on Continental Europe, we believe, will make it easier. And the fact that we've delivered this consistent performance. So I think this is a product that could scale. It's not the size of the U.S. market. So I wouldn't have those kind of expectations. But certainly, it's gone from raising single-digit dollars or euros.

Now, as you pointed out, $700 million in a quarter, and we have real positive momentum there. So it's an example, again, of the strength of our platform and the way it's globalizing and the growing receptivity to private assets, not only in the U.S., but around the world. And so this is one where we're going to just keep focusing on it, keep delivering strong returns, and I think it can consistently grow.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.

Kenneth Worthington
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Curious how you see the deployment opportunities developing in real estate this year, particularly core versus opportunistic? And you've got plenty of capital still in the latest flagship BREP funds. How does the deployment pipeline look for those funds this year?

Jonathan Gray
General Partner, President, COO & Director

Well, I'd say it's been a little bit lumpy. We've done some big things. We said here, we've deployed across the whole real estate platform in the last 2 years, $50 billion. But sellers generally are a bit reluctant because people obviously want to see higher prices, want to see the sector recover I think you'll continue to see us find some big things to do. I think we'll continue to invest in AI infrastructure and data centers in this space.

I think we'll continue to look for privatizations because certain parts of the public real estate market are lagging. And then as values start to move up again and sellers become more motivated, I think we'll see transaction activity pick up. It's still very low relative to historic levels. And again, this is an asset class that's not going away. Real estate has fallen pretty far out of favor and yet hard assets, apartments, logistics, beachfront hotels, they're definitely going to have long-term demand. I would say, I think the focus for us initially will be more on the opportunistic side. But over time here, I think you'll see more and more transaction activity.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Arnaud Giblat with BNP.

Arnaud Giblat
BNP Paribas, Research Division

I was wondering if you could carry on the real estate side. Could you talk a bit more about the outlook for performance in multifamily. I mean, I heard what you said with regards to the very low levels of new starts and potential from rate cap improvements bleeding into performance. But I was just wondering if you could develop a bit more what are the drivers you see that could help that performance in multi-family.

Jonathan Gray
General Partner, President, COO & Director

What we've seen in multifamily in the U.S. has been pretty slow growth, in some cases, modestly negative, pretty flat the last couple of years as the absorption of instruction and slower job growth just basically led to a relatively flat market.

I think the good news sign goes back to the supply dynamic, which is the starts are now down 2/3 from their peak. That takes a while to work through the system. But when you stop building new supply, that should be supportive of rental values over time. And again, this is a sector so as long as the population continues to grow.

There's some aging of existing stock. There should be incremental demand and better fundamentals, we have seen an improvement over what we saw versus 6 months ago, 12 months ago. And again, the cost to own remains pretty high, which is pushing people into the rental area.

So I would say, overall, logistics is clearly in a better position today, which is our biggest asset class, multifamily in the U.S., our second biggest area is beginning to show some better signs, but that lack of new supply, combined with a healthy economy should create a favorable dynamic as we work through this year.

Operator

Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.

Patrick Davitt
Autonomous Research US LP

You talked about the increased demand for IG Private Credit but mostly from institutional pools, it seems like retail demand for those strategies has been slow to develop, just looking at BMACX and similar products from other managers. Do you think the relative yields or returns are to be low relative to other products in the market? Or is it something else?

And then, I guess, looking forward, given your discussions and education process with the distributors, do you see a path to a meaningful uptick there as that process plays out?

Jonathan Gray
General Partner, President, COO & Director

So what I would say on the individual investor side, there clearly is more attraction to higher-yielding products on credit relative to the institution who are just looking at a pure fixed income replacement, but I do think over time, these things will evolve. I mean, if you think about the evolution of alternatives, they really started at the highest level with private equity and real estate private equity.

And over time, with institutions have also migrated into infrastructure and real estate and performing credit non-investment grade now investment grade. I would guess as alternatives mature over time and they're more and more accepted, you'll see a similar path. It may not happen overnight, but they won't just think about I'm going to do an alternative just because I'm going to get a double-digit return. I think people will begin to recognize the benefit of a premium return over what I can get in liquid markets. But as it relates to fixed income, investment-grade fixed income today, it's not there yet.

We will take our final question from Crispin Love with Piper Sandler.

Crispin Love
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

You announced the BREIT bonus shares early in the quarter. It's not huge, but first, how is the uptake on that special so far? And then was that driven by your opportunity to deploy capital in real estate, and then where are you most focused in that area for deployment?

And then also just separately, how are your institutional investors doing in real estate. Is the interest improving, noticing a shift in sentiment?

Jonathan Gray
General Partner, President, COO & Director

Well, I definitely say that the institutional owners are much more open to hearing about real estate than they were, let's say, 2 years ago. That sentiment is starting to shift and getting better.

On the individual side, we have seen some uptick in BREIT over the last year, but it's been modest. The motivation for the bonus shares was really about attracting more capital to invest into what we think will be a very favorable environment.

We did have in December the best net flows in the BREIT that we've seen in more than 3 years. So -- but at this point, I think it's still too early to see what the reaction is going to be. I think the key thing with BREIT, as with all these products will be performance. So the fact that we posted something at 8.1% last year, which was well better than the public markets well better than other private REITs is important. We've got to continue to consistently deliver strong performance. I believe if we do that, we'll begin to see the flows pick up in BREIT over time.
