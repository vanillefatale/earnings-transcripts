Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Gerry Sweeney with ROTH Capital Partners.

Gerard Sweeney
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to talk about the fire service tenders, $38 million high probability. What makes you think they're high probability? And then the follow-on of that was would be that $178 million total, is there an opportunity for that to expand further, especially with some of the NFPA determinations coming out in the next couple -- hopefully, in the next month or 2?

James Jenkins
President, CEO & Executive Chairman

Yes, Gerry. So Yes. So I'm going to -- I'm glad Barry is here. It's one of the reasons why I wanted to have Barry and Cameron here was to talk about some of these opportunities. And Barry, I'll let you sort of answer that because I know there's a number of buckets that those fall into those high probabilities.

Barry Phillips
Chief Revenue Officer - Fire

Yes. Thanks, Jim. There are places there's 4 buckets to position ourselves in a high probability position is, are we the incumbent, so do we already have the business with that core relationship with that end department. Next would be is the competitor that's incumbent struggling in some manner. Additionally, we are also looking at where we can come in with multiple brand strategy. And with some of our portfolio that we have overlaps in year, for example, we can have more bids involved in the process. And lastly, if we're positioned well with the department and we're written into the specifications.

James Jenkins
President, CEO & Executive Chairman

So Gerry, that $38 million is where all of those sort of 4 buckets fall for us. So that's why we view them as high probabilities. And then that $178 million, look, we had all the high probabilities, and we'll win some of the others in $178 million. But I think if you talk to any of our competitors, they'll say the same thing. Once these certifications and standards are adopted, sort of the floodgates should open over a period of time.

And again, I think what we're trying to caution is it's not going to -- it's going to happen, and it's going to happen during fiscal '27, but it's going to happen over a period of time during that fiscal year. I look at certifications and standards and they appear over a very long period of time, there's a 10-year sort of window for these standards. And kind of like the cicadas, they show up every 17 years, these standards kind of show up. And when they do, there's a bit of a loggerhead here that kind of gets kind of slows it down on the decision-making front.

I talked about this in prior calls about the '25 year automobile model versus the '26 and waiting. And this is exactly what's happened I think in the tender cycle that we're seeing is that these tenders, particularly in the U.S. and in areas where NFPA is becoming more rapidly accepted, those tenders have slowed. And so we'll see those pick up as soon as those standards are issued. But recently, we believe the standards were going to come into play in March '25. They were then extended to September of '25 and ultimately extend it to March of '26. We have no reason to believe. And in fact, what we're hearing is that, that will be the date, the '26 should be to date, March '26 should be the date. So that's why we're feeling very bullish about where we're driving our fire opportunities.

Gerard Sweeney
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then on the margin front, if I heard you correctly, Obviously, there's a lot more costs, tariffs, raw materials, logistics, et cetera. But it sounded also -- that sounds as though you could recover those costs to just higher absorption or higher production levels and absorbing some of the overhead? Did I hear that correctly? Or could you walk through that?

James Jenkins
President, CEO & Executive Chairman

That is correct. It's a function of getting ourselves at full capacity at a certain dollar amount where that operating leverage kicks in. So that's a critical component to it. The other is while you're waiting for tenders you're selling goods and gloves and boots and frankly, lower margin products to your captive customers who have those needs, and occasionally replacing turnout gear, but it's not 500 suits or 1,000 suits, it's 50.

Cameron Stokes
Chief Commercial Officer of Global Industrials

So yes, it's actually a reflection of product mix. So typically, we'd be having a high range or more than 2/3 of our fire sales would be in custom-made turnout gear and the remainder being the commodity products, now we're in the higher range in the commodities while we're waiting for the turnout of your business to come back into -- with the new standard.

James Jenkins
President, CEO & Executive Chairman

You kind of couple that in a perfect storm with what's transpired in Latin America, where we've had a significant reliance on Argentina, whether that was true or not, it was just the case. And you dropped that high margin and you dropped the high margin, you see some softness in the high-margin areas in Canada, and that generates sort of a perfect storm when you've got the industrials that have a geopolitical component and then we have a tender delay. I'm not suggesting those are excuses. Those are just -- we need to work our way around those excuses or those issues, and we are. And we're driving similar opportunities in industrial, and I can certainly have Cameron address that.

Gerard Sweeney
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

Got you. One more question. Obviously, multiple international acquisitions, global footprint. How important is getting the ERP system up and running to really give you visibility on those mechanics?

James Jenkins
President, CEO & Executive Chairman

The ERP system, so there's a couple of places internationally where the ERP -- the systems you have are pretty solid. China has got a good system for Asia. We've got a nice system in Argentina for Latin America. And so those are -- we look at those as lower priorities. Veridian has a very solid ERP system as well. So the prioritization of this right now is North America, which we're driving towards a June, July rollout for our SAP implementation. And then the next phases are, frankly, to look at some of the acquisitions and folding some of those in. And then it's Vietnam and some other areas.

So it's going to take a prolonged period of time but getting the first step in place, which is North America, which is the sort of the brains of the organization, so to speak, the rest of the world is sort of the heart, having the brands of the organization with a solid system in place is going to service us mightily. Would you agree, Cameron?

Cameron Stokes
Chief Commercial Officer of Global Industrials

Yes. Yes.

And our next question comes from the line of Mark Smith with Lake Street Capital.

Mark Smith
Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division

I just wanted to ask about kind of certification delays. Can you give us an update on anything that changed on that since the end of the quarter?

James Jenkins
President, CEO & Executive Chairman

Yes. So the certification -- the delays in certification, we knew that, that certification was coming in March of '26. We also know that all of our products are in the queue for certification with all of our competitors. And I don't believe there's any exceptions at this point, Barry. So I'll ask you -- I mean, to the extent that we don't expect any further delays on that front.

Barry Phillips
Chief Revenue Officer - Fire

The one thing that is different in this cycle amongst my crew in this space. So this is actually the combination of 4 standards that were brought together as opposed to having a specific certification standard for firefighting gear. It now was grouped together where it includes firefighting gear, it includes SCA, PASS or Personal Alert Safety Systems as well as tactical peril, all under one standard. So that's forced now all the manufacturers to hustle in and go to the same sort of in agencies to address all these products that now need to be recertified. So there's quite a backlog at the certification agencies, which has been causing some of this delay for all of us.

Mark Smith
Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then if you think about kind of mitigate and offer to improve gross profit margin, can you just talk about headwinds and this one maybe you expect to normalize?

James Jenkins
President, CEO & Executive Chairman

Look, I think on the headwind front, sort of the tariffs, I mean, you've got we got to see with the tariffs. We're addressing that as best we can with sort of programs with our suppliers, we're simplifying the product line and sort of shifting production towards the higher-margin categories as those certifications come online, which is a certification component. And the idea here obviously is to do that do an SKU rationalization, which we're in the middle of.

We're rationalizing -- I mean we've got in on the past from a legacy perspective. We've had thousands of SKUs that Helena and her team are rationalizing now down to a much more manageable number. And of course, we've got the targeted inventory reductions and we're about 1/3 of the way there towards year-end of about $6 million, and we're hopeful we can get a little bit north of that.

So go ahead, Barry.

Barry Phillips
Chief Revenue Officer - Fire

Yes. Additionally, we are bringing third-party manufactured products into our own factories, in particular, with our turnover production.

Mark Smith
Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then lastly for me, thinking about tariffs, pipeline cost, raw material cost, can you just talk about pricing opportunities?

James Jenkins
President, CEO & Executive Chairman

Are you talking about pricing increases?

Mark Smith
Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division

Yes.

James Jenkins
President, CEO & Executive Chairman

Okay. So yes, so we have our annual pricing increases that have been -- are being communicated in fire and in industrial. We've got a different -- obviously, there are different businesses. So we're addressing them differently. It's not going to be a one-size-fits-all. We have pivoted a little bit in the tariff range because we have seen competitive pressures on pricing in that regard.

We still are sitting on a significant amount of inventory in the CE space, the critical environment space that we're looking to move on that is not is not tariff driven because we've got it in the states now. So we are increasing cases. We're not going to do them across the board. We're going to do them strategically. We've done it in fire, and we're doing it in industrial, and those are driving some additional decisions.

Cameron's got an inventory reduction program that he can certainly speak to that is driving decisions because our year-end is February 1, and a lot of our channel partners have new budgets starting January 1. So we're introducing some programs here to help drive some inventory towards the end of this fiscal year. with customers that beginning January 1, we'll have new money to utilize for that.

And our next question comes from the line of Mike Shlisky with DA Davidson.

Michael Shlisky
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Just to start with, I want to maybe ask for a quick NFPA 101 here. As far as I could tell, you're paying member or paying a paying customer of this organization, people on the board on the committee that approve all these products. And now their action or their lack of action is now causing your business to struggle and other parts of the industry as well. I get that they need time to make sure that firefighter safety is obviously the most important priority. But do you know what they're doing at the NFPA to increase their approval throughput. It just seems like at this point, they're now affecting business activity among their members, and that sounds like a real issue.

Barry Phillips
Chief Revenue Officer - Fire

NFPA is a standard writing body. They are not the certification agencies that certify the product. And the NFPA standard writing process, it involves a combination of end users, manufacturers and third-party experts that build up that committee and build up and write the standards that then go through the process and are reviewed on a 5-year cycle. So once the standard is written peer reviewed and approved and in process, then becomes the timing of -- from a manufacturing perspective is building to that standard, submitting to that standard of third-party agency and then basically waiting for the third-party agency to commit the approval or provide whatever actions well, generally UL has now all of our competitors and our products sitting there and they've got limited resources.

Michael Shlisky
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Okay. So now let's go the next question. They're a public company at this point. And their lack of action is now causing your business to suffer. So have you heard anything from those folks about how fast they're going to increased the throughput of approvals?

James Jenkins
President, CEO & Executive Chairman

They are working with the resources that they have available to them and working through the process. We have -- there are options to go to other certification agencies and we use different certification agencies around the world, but we find the same level of performance to wrap. We are committed to push through as rapidly as possible and we'll continue to do so. It is a third-party agency and it's outside of our control.

Michael Shlisky
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Okay. Maybe last one on this topic. Who's paying the bill the NPA or Lakeland for the UL and other agency testing?

James Jenkins
President, CEO & Executive Chairman

Each manufacturer pays for their certification activities.

Michael Shlisky
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Okay. SP1 Thank you for all the information. Moving on, on the Hong Kong deal in Malaysia, do you think those are going to provide an is margin benefit given the size and the footprint you have there? Should we expect to see some really good margins I guess, starting in fiscal '27 from those 2 contracts?

James Jenkins
President, CEO & Executive Chairman

Yes. The Malaysia contract, certainly, that's a high-margin opportunity, long-term opportunity for us. Hong Kong continues to generate really decent margins for us. The tragedy that occurred in Hong Kong, exactly when you operate a business like this, strategies end up generating, frankly, opportunities. And in Hong Kong, our team set hours and hours and hours over time, helping that Hong Kong team as they thought those fires in those 4 buildings and people lost their lives.

They're going to need a lot of -- they're going to need a lot of new turnout gear as a result of that. And we've been on the phone periodically with our friends in Hong Kong driving that business. and they're suggesting to us that we'll see a bump in business there probably in the first quarter of fiscal '27.

Michael Shlisky
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Okay. Great. Sounds good. And then I guess, given this data, there's some -- quite a few contracts in the pipeline on the fire side. But given the status of -- you mentioned there are some customers or some competitors that were struggling, are you concerned at all in the pricing environment for what's being bid on today and some of the other folks out there might get a little bit of rationale if they're in a bit of a pickle financially?

James Jenkins
President, CEO & Executive Chairman

Well, struggling can be at various different batches. Sometimes it's struggling just to perform and support and provide the equipment in a timely manner. One of the things the standard is also providing is there are requirements -- varied requirements in the fabrics that are being used in the products. So it's changing the buildup of those products, which is going to change the price point actually at a higher level in the marketplace because of the needs to incorporate the more advanced fabrics into the year.

Operator

Thank you. And with that, there are no further questions, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Jenkins for closing remarks.
