Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Brian Chin with Stifel.

Brian Chin
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

A few questions. Maybe just first with the maintaining the outlook, although changing the components a little bit. Firstly, first half -- fiscal first half versus fiscal second half guidance, I guess does that suggest that the February quarter revenue is down maybe low to mid-single digits? And kind of which of the segments is driving that sequential decline? And then also for the full year, raising the memory revenue growth to 20% to 35% year-over-year. But certainly, pricing should be a favorable tailwind. Curious if there are any kind of challenges or constraints shipping product given sort of how constrained some of the memory wafer supply is at the moment?

Mark Adams
President, CEO & Director

Brian, thanks for the question. I'll take the first end of it, and then I'll hand it over to Nate.

There's two implications to the kind of forward-looking assumptions. To speak to the memory one, we continue to do a fairly good job navigating the supply constraints you're alluding to, and that allowed us to think through kind of how that business should perform going forward. And so we haven't seen anything material impacting that business and which allowed us to kind of get more granularity on the forward-looking projection, so to speak.

On the Advanced Computing piece, and we'll talk about some of this through the call. But when we're winning these new customers, there's a process of kind of getting the award. And then since they're new customers, in many cases, we have to negotiate a master agreement, and then from there that gets converted into a purchase order. There's just more timing involved in new customers.

Now the exciting news is we are winning more new customers, but the predictability gets a little bit tougher for us in a given quarter, so to speak. And that's where, I guess, we're a little bit more cautious. I would say just -- we talked about an award with a major financial institution last quarter. I'm happy to announce that we've signed that agreement, and we expect the PO here shortly this week or worst case next. I can also tell you that we have the same -- we have a major new oil and gas customer that we've also signed a master agreement with and expecting a PO in here shortly as in the next week or so.

And so as we go through that, the timing of then getting the POs in the system and then going out and sourcing components and staging the equipment, all of that becomes just tougher for a first-time customer in the model. And that's where you may sense a little bit of caution as we think about our Q2 and even back half guidance to when things will hit. Nate?

Nate Olmstead
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I mean I would say when you think about the full year outlook, obviously, the most significant changes would be memory looking a little bit stronger, as you alluded to, due to some benefits from pricing primarily, although the overall demand remains very strong and healthy there. But our ability to procure supply is going to be one of the key variables to think about the memory outlook for the full year. And then LED looks like it's going to be weaker. That was fairly broad-based across the regions in Q1. Q2 is always a little bit softer in LED because of Chinese New Year. So I'd expect some sequential pressure probably in the LED business.

I also expect sequentially advanced computing to be down Q1 to Q2, but that's what we expected when we laid things out last quarter. I think Q1 came in right about where we thought. Q2 looks similar to what we thought. And in the back half of the year, we expect some strength due to the -- some of the opportunities we see in the pipeline and bookings that are starting to shape up.

Brian Chin
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Great. Maybe just for a quick follow-up. In terms of the pipeline in advanced computing, can you maybe elaborate on how some of your expansive channel partnerships with Dell, CDW, you've got sort of the strategic relationship with SKT. I think you alluded to maybe future cloud opportunities on a sovereign basis, and maybe that's contributing to the potentials for fiscal second half. Maybe can you kind of expand on how some of those partnerships are helping with the pipeline?

Mark Adams
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think across the board, most of what you talked about have been fairly exciting for us to engage with and representing a much stronger pipeline for us.

I'll try to break it down. In terms of CDW, you had mentioned, our capabilities in kind of the AI factory environment and large-scale deployments is a great addition to CDW's capabilities and competencies. And we've got some good customer opportunities that just in our managed services and software solution set that we can bring to customers that are of large scale. And they're definitely represented in our pipeline.

If you contemplate our relationship with NVIDIA, it continues to get stronger and stronger as the enterprise deployments scale and grow in number, being a services solutions provider for NVIDIA-based AI factories, Penguin is very well positioned there, and we continue to strengthen that partnership. and evaluating how we can bring the best of what we do with NVIDIA to form a strategic solution offering for our customers long term. And so the engagements with NVIDIA continue to strengthen.

SKT is an exciting partnership. We've talked about on prior calls. There continues to be opportunities with them both in Korea and outside of Korea. And then we've mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've had a couple of -- a few new sovereign cloud opportunities of large scale that are in the pipeline and very exciting just because given the raw investment that is going to go into each of these deployments, we stand to benefit from our involvement. And hopefully, we'll be able to update you on future calls here.

Your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.

Manmohanpreet Singh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

This is MP on behalf of Samik Chatterjee. So, firstly, I wanted to ask about the enterprise engagements, like you have been talking about the shift from hyperscalers towards then enterprises deploying for pilot programs and then towards broader enterprise-wide applications. Can you please help us understand like what exactly are you seeing, which is helping you see clearly mark that trend out?

And then other than that, I wanted you to double-click a bit on your diversification efforts.

Mark Adams
President, CEO & Director

Sure. Let me start with your first question. If I look back over the last three or four years, most of the capital expenditure dollars of massive -- of large-scale deployments was in the area of large language model training at large hyperscalers for the most part, okay? I don't want to be universal in saying 100%, but a majority of the spend that we saw was in a very consolidated set of customers. And if you want to triangulate that data with what's going on in the market, look at where NVIDIA was selling their GPUs as an example, you'll see that their major customers were consolidated to a few large hyperscale type environments. We saw the same thing.

I'd say over the last 6 to 12 months, we've seen the beginning of an evolution where enterprise opportunities are accelerating in terms of just raw volume of enterprise opportunities. And I would say the capital behind that and the planning for future growth and expansion in our customer relationships in the enterprise back that up. And so it's really been an evolution, a shift from early-stage large language model training to corporate enterprise rollout.

And just based on our own pipeline activity, but also just raw market data in terms of where the products are going, we're fairly bullish on the enterprise environment as well we are on these larger sovereign AI deals. The combination of that makes us feel pretty strong on our pipeline development and diversification efforts.

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Calitri with Needham & Company LLC.

Matthew Calitri
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

This is Matt Calitri over at Needham. Last quarter, you noted an inventory increase to support shipments at the start of 1Q FY '26. And while inventory declined sequentially, it still remains elevated. How should we think about inventory levels as a leading indicator for future shipments? And how is your visibility into the remainder of the year?

Nate Olmstead
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, you're right. Last quarter, we exited the quarter with some inventory. That was both in memory, where the price increases, when the prices go up, you're going to see that reflected in inventory. The cost of the goods goes up. And we also had some shipments in advanced computing, which shipped early this past quarter in Q1.

So I think inventory being higher than where it was a year ago is not surprising given that the overall business is larger, especially in memory. It was up 41% year-over-year. But if you look at the inventory days or the inventory turns, they're in a very healthy position. So certainly no concerns there. returning inventory quickly. Our business model is not one where we're buying really ahead of orders. We're buying to orders rather than to forecast generally.

Now in today's constrained memory environment, we'll look for opportunities where we can secure some supply to take some risk off the table, and we have a strong balance sheet that we intend to put to use if the opportunity is out there for us to do that.

Matthew Calitri
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Very helpful.

Nate Olmstead
Senior VP & CFO

On the question the back half of the year, I think Mark talked already about some of the opportunities in the pipeline. It remains consistent with what we mentioned last quarter. We expect the second half of the year to be stronger in the first half. That will be especially true in advanced computing, perhaps in memory as well, again, contingent upon us being able to secure supply. But that's consistent with what we said last quarter.

Matthew Calitri
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then can you expand a little bit upon -- I think in the prepared remarks, you mentioned some work being done to customize ICE to be compatible with other open source platforms. What exactly are you guys working on there?

Mark Adams
President, CEO & Director

As we think about the software stack for AI factory rollouts, there's different layers of software. Like, for example, there's cluster management layers, there's security layers, there's orchestration layers. And so what we're trying to do is build a stand-alone stack, which is partly our ICE platform and then partly best-of-breed open software stacking components that allow us to have a unique solution and that we can manage all of it as opposed to our customers having to go out and pick pieces to it.

And we're working with customers to define what that might look like in a Penguin stack that's partially our own developed ICE platform and partially best-in-class third-party software that gives the customer the best software features. And by the way, that includes working with companies like NVIDIA to have their software as part of a customized platform for future development deployments.

[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Maddie De Paola with Rosenblatt Securities.

Madison de Paola
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

This is Maddie calling on behalf of Kevin Cassidy. I was just wondering, given the recent Marvell acquisition of Celestial AI and just a broader shift towards optical fabrics, are you seeing any change in optical memory and related technologies?

Mark Adams
President, CEO & Director

I wouldn't say we're seeing any changes. I think it's a strong validation of the market opportunity, broad macro opportunity. People are definitely looking at this dynamic of enhancing the bandwidth performance between memory and GPU/CPUs. So when I think about an established company like Marvell making such an investment that's publicly been announced, I -- it makes me feel good about the direction and the strategy that we're deploying here in developing that type of system-level product in memory.

There are no further questions at this time. I will now hand it back to Mark Adams, CEO, for closing remarks.

Mark Adams
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, operator. I would like to thank our worldwide employees for their dedication and commitment. Our Q1 results reinforce that we are on the right path, and we continue to grow our pipeline of new opportunities, helping our valued customers manage the complexity of their AI infrastructure. Thank you all for joining today's call.
