[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.

Christian Carlino

Hi, good morning. It's Christian Carlino on for Chris. I appreciate the color on how you're thinking about tariffs, but just given the consumers felt so much inflation over the past couple of years, could you talk through the different scenarios you're thinking about in the event the 145% on China holds and then how toy spend is impacted relative to the broader impact on the consumer's wallet?

Chris Cocks

Sure. Good morning, Christian. Before I answer the question, in case there was any doubt, we kicked off the call with Fred Wightman, our new VP of Investor Relations. It wasn't Kristen Levy with a serious cold.

Gina Goetter

So Kristen is still here. He is here in the room.

Chris Cocks

Yes, Kristen is still here. So we've looked at a variety of scenarios and I would say we have a pretty cautious outlook in terms of what the impacts of the current tariff regime would have. Basically we see the impacts to consumer spending on the toy category consistent with what happened with the 2008, 2009 recession. The toy category was down roughly mid-single-digits. Hasbro fared a bit better at that time based on entertainment roadmaps and innovation that we had as well as Wizards of the Coast.

And then in terms of what we think the inflationary outlook looks like in terms of prices in the category, we went back to 2020 and 2021 with the early days of COVID So we basically see a combination of inflation and some recessionary pressures on the macro. That said, we think the toy category early in 2025, and we think this will extend throughout the year, will kind of reassert its traditional focus on resiliency or its traditional position of resiliency. It tends to be a category of small luxuries.

It tends to be a category which is heavily gift oriented. And so we think it's going to fare better than other discretionary categories or other experience categories. So that's kind of the puts and the takes we have. Obviously, if tariffs change, that outlook will change, but right now that's our basis at 145% with China and 10% everywhere else.

Christian Carlino

Got it. That's really helpful. Could you talk to what are your conversations with retailers? Like there's media reports about some big players canceling orders from China, but it sounds like you're not seeing that. And could you maybe talk about how much of this pressure is being absorbed by maybe the third party manufacturers versus the retailers? And are you seeing retailers go to more direct imports to negotiate direct with the manufacturers and just any color there on how the impact is being shared across the supply chain?

Gina Goetter

Got it. Good morning, Christian. Our conversations with the retailers are pretty fluid. For as many curve balls that are being thrown at us, the same kind of curve balls are being thrown to them and everyone is taking a slightly different approach with how they're managing their inventory and their order pattern. So we haven't seen on the big three, we're not seeing a ton of canceled orders and different thinking of how they're going to approach the holiday. But we are having very active discussions on how we're managing inventory as we move through say this Q2 period and then Q3, which is when you tend to see the resets start to happen ahead of the holiday season. So nothing hugely material in terms of orders being canceled or seeing instances, as you said or asked in your question of them going directly to the manufacturer. But we are seeing some shifts on how we're thinking about the phasing throughout the year.

Chris Cocks

Yes. Just to add a little bit more color. You know, I would say our first principle in all of this is don't overreact and I think our retail partners have appreciated that perspective. Now, Hasbro is able to come from a privileged perspective on that. You know, somewhere around 45 to 50% of our U.S. sales are either domestically sourced or based on digital or licensing from domestic companies. So that gives us a little bit more buffer than the typical toy company, which is 80% plus of their volume comes from China and most of it, the rest from Southeast Asia. So, you know, in terms of our discussions with retailers, we're talking a lot about, okay, how can we keep prices as consistent as possible for consumers, especially for items that we think will be fantastic gifts that kids will be asking for and moms and dads and aunts and uncles will want to give.

That said, we are having discussions around pricing more broadly. At this level of tariffs, I don't think you can avoid it. But generally speaking, I think it's a set of discussions in the spirit of partnership. The one thing I'll add to a little bit on what Gina said is, we are seeing a change from direct import to domestic and that will change the nature of the timing of when our orders will be fulfilled. I think Q2 is pretty dynamic, but I definitely think Q2 will be impacted on direct import. Now, that said, we might be able to compensate for it on domestic. We'll probably have to give you guys some updates as the quarter goes on, on future conferences.

Gina Goetter

How about this, was the longest answer ever to this question, I'm going to add one more point to Chris’ comment. The other strength or opportunity that we have with our retailers, the discussions that we're having, we're anticipating some shelves, shelf opportunities and stepping into some white space. So again, with the, the health of our inventory, with the health of our kind of supply chain and how diversified we are, we're also using this opportunity to partner with all of our retailers to step into some new opportunities as well. So we're trying to play both defense and offense at the same time.

Christian Carlino

Super helpful. Thank you very much. Best of luck.

Operator

Our next question is from Megan Clapp with Morgan Stanley.

Megan Clapp

Hey, good morning and thanks so much. My first question is just a bit more of a clarification and then I have a follow up on Wizards. So the clarifying question is, Chris, I think you said something, I know you said something in your prepared remarks just about prolonged, the potential for prolonged tariffs, creating structural costs and uncertainty. And I wanted to just clarify, is that meant to say that the exposure or the kind of the headwind that Gina talked about this year, could that get worse next year? Is that what you were meaning to imply from a cost perspective? Obviously, you'll have to lap through it as it rolls into 2026, given inventory, but I just wanted to maybe if you could expand upon what exactly that comment meant.

Chris Cocks

Yes, well, I think it's two things. I think the first thing you're correct in that, you know, right now we're able to basically defer paying a bunch of tariffs because for the first four or five months of the year we' having a large number of deliveries. So there will be incremental tariff exposure that you'd have next year if the current duties continued. That would be a headwind.

The second thing is by moving things around in our supply chain, we have a lot of flexibility, like by the end of this year, hundreds of SKUs for the U.S. will be moved from China based manufacturing to alternate locations. And I think we're going to meaningfully accelerate our diversification efforts in terms of where we can source product from. Right now we source it from eight countries. That's probably going to expand to nine to 10 in the very near-term. And I think you're going to meaningfully see a big difference in terms of the percentage of product coming from China to the U.S. much faster than what we previously communicated.

Some of that though comes with the cost. When we manufacture board games in the U.S. it is significantly more expensive to manufacture here than it is in China for instance. If we move products like sourcing for PLAY-DOH from China, which is where it's dominantly sourced from the U.S. today, to Turkey, which we've been using to source to Europe, there is a cost associated with that because the logistics in Turkey are just kind of different and we were looking at that across multiple product lines. We feel like over time we'll be able to manage the bulk of that and we'll be able to make these changes on a cost neutral basis. But at least in the midterm, that increased complexity and that increased load on new logistics centers will have some costs associated with our outlook.

Gina Goetter

Yes, Megan, as you think about the phasing of that gross impact that I had in my prepared remarks of $100 million to $300 million, that is really all in the back half. So just as you think about what that is going to mean for 2026, the absolute kind of annualized number goes up. Now to Chris point, all of the work that we have to diversify our supply chain and move product around, that will help to mitigate probably the bigger number that you would calculate. But that's why kind of as you think this year's impact versus next year's impact, there's still a material cost headwind coming at us.

Megan Clapp

Okay, that's really helpful. Makes a lot of sense. And then just a follow up on Wizards. So really strong performance in MAGIC in particular in 1Q. It sounds like you're raising the guide both for the 1Q outperformance versus your expectations as well as some better expectations for the remainder of the year. Is there any way to kind of parse out what is being raised for 1Q versus the rest of the year? And related to that, you're incorporating some additional, it seems like conservatism just around the consumer into CP. Are you doing the same in Wizards?

Chris Cocks

Well, we'll tag team this between Gina and I. So I'd say Wizards had meaningful outperformance in Q1. We also think it's going to do pretty darn well in Q2. Just to give some color on that, Final Fantasy will be the best selling set of all time on day one. It already is. And so then it will have room to run in Q3 and Q4. And we feel really good about the back half releases as well, particularly the new Universes Beyond sets. You know, as we look at Wizards, our store count is up 20% versus what it was 18 months ago. It's very clear to us that Universes Beyond as a strategy has increased the total active installed base of MAGIC players, both in terms of reigniting lapsed fans as well as bringing in new fans.

And just historically, MAGIC has been very economically macro resilient. You know, in 2008, 2009 it was growing double digits. It's a passion based game that's not really tied and the collectors aren't really tied to the S&P 500 or the performance thereof. So we feel pretty good about where Wizards is sitting and pretty confident in our guidance raise for it.

Gina Goetter

So if you think about then the phasing of the year, remember back in February we said that Q1 and Q4 for Wizards were going to be the strongest growth quarters, and we continue to believe that. As you look at the ones though sandwiched in the middle Q2 and Q3, they're stronger. Q2 is going to look a little bit goofy because of some of the comps. So we are expecting Q2 revenue to be down in Q2. MAGIC will be up. It'll be a healthy MAGIC growth business. But we're comping one to a lesser extent, the difference in Baldur’s Gate and Monopoly Go! this year versus last year.

But then also remember, to bigger extent, we had a favorable licensing settlement last year that benefited revenue that were lapping. So when we come to Q2, you'll see probably low single-digit declines in revenue and then from a margin standpoint, still very healthy. But you'll see that big step up in royalty expense as we launch Universes Beyond. So I think the way that most models have been set with that growth Q1, Q4, that's the right way to think about it. And the middle two quarters got a little bit better, but there's a little bit of bumpiness just given comps.

Megan Clapp

Okay, super helpful, thank you.

Gina Goetter

Thanks, Megan.

Our next question is from James Hardiman with Citi.

James Hardiman

Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So wanted to dig in a little bit. I think Chris, you talked about the conservative nature of the guide. And I guess specifically I think it's Slide 16, the bridge slide. And I love a good bridge.

Gina Goetter

Love a good bridge slide. Everyone loves a good bridge slide.

James Hardiman

Everybody loves a good bridge. So I want to make sure we're all capturing all the information that's in that slide. I think what this would suggest is that you're factoring in the full brunt of the 145% and anything less than that would ultimately have led to a higher adjusted EBITDA guide versus where you previously were.

And then I think there were also some comments about sort of the industry assumptions in the prepared remarks, I guess the second part of the question would be, I mean GFC [ph] level industry declines and COVID level inflation, is that also sort of what's built into this unchanged EBITDA guide? And if we get anything better than that, would that also ultimately be upside to the number?

Gina Goetter

Yes. Do you want to start?

Chris Cocks

Good morning, James. I just want to clarify my quote, because on advice of counsel, you'll never hear me say conservative on a call, I always say cautious. But I'm going to let Gina take this one.

Gina Goetter

Good clarification. So good questions. I think your synopsis is generally right. And when you look at the waterfall chart on Page 16, what is embedded in that red bar is that higher tariff rate of 145%. And an assumption that the retail sales follow similar trends to what we saw in 2008 and 2009 like the overall kind of macro was down, call it 6% to 8% and that's what we have factored in to our outlook for that kind of worst case scenario.

Now to your point, if we weren't on the worst case and we go to the other side, would our guide be up? Yes, probably. However, one of the muscles that we're flexing is, we're pulling in and accelerating a lot of the cost savings pipeline initiatives that we had in motion. So there could be, if it starts to mitigate some, you might see us slow down or rethink the pacing of some of those. But by and large I mean the strength of Wizards and the momentum that we have there in and of itself would have probably taken us over it if that red bar wasn't there.

James Hardiman

Got it. That all makes a ton of sense. And then maybe help us sort of handicap the risk of the rest of the world. Seems to me that at least one of the incremental surprises coming out of Liberation Day was the heavy handed nature on the rest of the world right outside of China. And so much of your sort of diversification strategy has been to move out of China into some of these other countries that are now being tariff to a certain degree at least you know, that 10% number. And who knows what's ultimately going to happen in July.

But maybe help us understand the CP exposure to the rest of the world, specifically those 10% tariff countries, and how you think about again moving production out of China, a lot of these countries seem like safe havens and I don't know, how do you even make decisions in this current environment? Thanks.

Chris Cocks

Well, I think that goes back to first principle, just answering your last question, which is don't overreact. Our assumption is that we will get to a reasonable and logical trade policy ultimately once all the negotiations are done. We're not making any kind of hopeful assumptions that that happens soon. Our guidance is based off of 145% and 10% reciprocal everywhere else and we're assuming that that holds for the balance of the year.

If the reciprocal tariffs increased and China did not change, that would be a headwind, obviously. And we would have to take that into account. In terms of how we're thinking about the rest of the world in terms of a market and not just as a supply, a source of supply. We see it as an opportunity. Our business is under indexed a bit inside of Europe. We see a lot of retailer excitement for some of the new product lines we have, the new Peppa Pig products that we have, all the great Marvel stuff that we have coming out. MAGIC certainly is looking like it's going to be a winner in markets like Europe and Japan. So we see some potential for upside there, especially as we kind of prioritize where our SKUs are going, and where our marketing dollars are going in terms of market upside. APAC likewise, we see some opportunities there.

And then the other thing that we're doing a lot of is starting to look at ODMs in Vietnam, India and even China in terms of more value SKUs and getting more aggressive about real low price points and driving some breakthrough pricing opportunities for market like LATAM and Southeast Asia via our everyone plays initiative as part of play to win.

So, I'd say, 145% and 10% is our base outlook. If that changes to the negative, it certainly is a headwind. What we don't necessarily have factored into our guide though is, hey, is there any market upside in terms of kind of shifting SKUs and shifting our marketing priorities? And so we'll play that out over the next couple months.

Gina Goetter

Yes. With our team, we're really trying to avoid the analysis paralysis and the churn that that can cause on decision making. So we're staying very focused on what is known. And right now what is known is the 145% and the 10%. All of the moves that we're making both within our supply chain as well as with our customer base, we would categorize as no regret moves. Like, it's good for us to have a more diversified footprint, so we'll just keep moving down that path.

James Hardiman

Got it. That's really helpful. Thanks, Chris. Thanks, Gina.

Gina Goetter

Thank you.

Chris Cocks

Thanks.

Our next question is from Arpine Kocharyan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.

Arpine Kocharyan

Hi. Thanks for taking my question and thanks for all the detail you already provided. Sorry to go back to the tariff sensitivity slide, but could you maybe clarify, is it fair to assume that those mitigating efforts will include bringing China exposure for consumer products below – substantially below the 50% mark? I think you had given 40% exposure for China for 2026 before, I guess. Do you have a sense of where that could be for next year as of today, to the extent you can predict that?

And then in terms of other mitigating factors, whether it's cost saves to find ways to make things cheaper or taking pricing, is it possible for you to detail sort of assumptions there? Let's say making things cheaper could offset X% of impact and then pricing will offset the rest. To the extent it's possible to quantify, I know it's very difficult at this point you're probably looking at 1,000 factors.

Gina Goetter

A thousand factors. That's probably right. Good questions and good morning. I'll start by saying first, we are a global company. China is going to continue to remain an important manufacturing hub for us. And while our U.S. toy game business is roughly 55% of our revenue, 45% of it is okay with getting goods from China. So China is always going to be a manufacturing hub for us.

As we think about our moves from the 50% to your point, we said back in February we were on a path to move to under 40% by 2026. We are speeding that up. So we are expecting accelerating our efforts there. It will, we're targeting to be below that 40% by 2026. We are still kind of nailing down final plans and final product lines and what all this is going to mean with our, with the supplier base, et cetera. So I'm not going to give you an exact percentage now. But I think that the path we were on to get to 40% by 2026 is going to be faster than that.

As you think about then the mitigating levers that we have, again I'm not going to give you exact dollars because they're all in the way that you've laid it out. They're all kind of muddled together. But there's really, if you go from that gross impact, I'll just anchor to the high end of the range of $300 million kind of gross exposure down to the $180 million. What we're seeing is the net impact. There's really three big things to focus on and we've talked lot about the supply chain. That's the first big thing and just how we're both shifting product around our existing manufacturing base, how we're managing inventory levels? How we're then kind of accelerating diversification? That provides a big mitigating lever for us.

The second piece is in how we're managing our product in the broader portfolio. So we have done a significant amount of SKU reduction leading up SKU kind of rationalization as we led into this year, we're continuing to evaluate what makes sense in this current environment for the U.S. market. So some of our higher priced items or products that we just don't think are going to be tenable from a profitability standpoint, with 145% tariff on, we're taking different choices on. So that's kind of the next lever is that we're really focused on product. All of our DTV efforts and how that influences product cost. We're accelerating there.

And then the third piece of mitigating actions has everything to do with customer and commercial. How we're thinking about pricing and readying the pricing actions, how we're managing our allowances with the retailers. Now, when we talk about allowances, those are all the dollars that are sitting within gross-to-net, how we put those either to better use or drop them altogether. So taken together, the supply chain, how we're thinking about product? How we're thinking about commercial customer pricing? That's what gets us to kind of that $120 million difference between gross-to-net.

Arpine Kocharyan

That's very, very helpful Gina, thank you. And then one quick follow-up. Have you done any price elasticity of demand work to basically say X% of growth in pricing is X% impact on demand? I know it's difficult, right? Especially in this environment, but anything you could share with investors to help them think through pricing as a mitigating factor?

Chris Cocks

Well, we have. There's not a lot that I can share publicly since most of it's proprietary. We definitely think 99.9 and 19.99 are important. We definitely think innovation. And having a toy that has a must have factor to it, something that the kid asks for and is based off of a passion based purchase, is also super important.

And then last but not least, having great brands backed by fantastic fan bases and big entertainment moments is also super important. And so when you look at like what we just announced with Disney, there's no bigger brands in the Toy Aisle than Marvel and Star Wars. We're thrilled to be extending our multi-decade partnership with them. We've been working with the Walt Disney Company since the 1950s. I think Snow White and Cinderella were one of our first collaborations together.

And I love their roadmap. What they have coming up in 2026 and what they just announced at their Star Wars event in Japan a week or so ago for 2027, I think bodes pretty favorably for what the future is for that. And that's just one partnership in a series of partnerships that you're going to be hearing from us over the next several months and quarters that we're going to bring the best brands to our aisles that have the highest pricing power and the surest demand. And I think that's going to position us favorably over the long term.

Arpine Kocharyan

Thank you very much.

Operator

Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Handler with Roth Capital.

Eric Handler

Good morning. Thanks for the question. You had pretty significant outperformance from MAGIC in the quarter, at least relative to my model. I wonder if you could sort of rank like where all that upside came from?

Chris Cocks

So I think it's a couple things. We did have a bit of an extra set or half an extra set in terms of a remastered set. Our backlist performed very, very well. And then early ordering for Tarkir: Dragonstorm has been very strong. So probably the biggest thing was like the backlist over performance. And then Secret Lair has actually been doing pretty well. I mean, the whole MAGIC business is just. It's difficult to identify just one thing really.

I think what we're seeing on MAGIC is an expansion of the player base and when you expand the player base, it's just a great opportunity to, engage them with more products and kind of create a network effect amongst the players in the collecting community. And we see that only strengthening as the year goes.

Eric Handler

Thanks, Chris. And then one question on sort of manufacturing, like, how easy is it to just pick up and leave a China manufacturing plant? How much lead time do you need to sort of switch over to another country? And can you do that before peak manufacturing times for the holidays for this year? Is this more of a 2026 event?

Gina Goetter

Yes, good question. Yes, I'll say it's more of a 2026 event. I mean, obviously the moves and the work is happening now and it depends on capabilities. There are some countries that have the capabilities and the infrastructure in place. So it's just a matter of kind of the development and quality engineering work that needs to happen to shift in others. There's a brand new build of capability, so it kind of runs the spectrum in terms of the length of time. But if you kind of anchor back to what we said in February, it was going to take us a couple of years to move from that 50% down to under 40% and now we're saying, oh gosh, we're going to get there a lot sooner. So we're speeding up the time to get that diversification.

Chris Cocks

Yes, and it depends on the category, Eric. So like for Plato, it's, send the boat to the U.S., don't send the boat to Italy from Turkey and then send the boat from China to Europe for NERF, where we have a very large India based footprint. We are able to like change production, but, not necessarily where the SKUs are produced.

So we are Changing what the SKU mix looks like inside of the aisle for the U.S. so that we can favor India based SKUs which maybe are older SKUs but are tried and true. But the benefit there is most of our competition, the white label competition and some of our other named competitors, they're solely China based. So we actually could come to market with a pricing advantage versus them.

So it's category by category. I think where you're going to find China based manufacturing the stickiest is really anything with electronics, anything with super high-end deco and then surprisingly anything made out of foam.

Gina Goetter

Except for darts.

Chris Cocks

Except for darts. But like foam role play, that tends to be a very specialized set of capabilities of Chinese manufacturing.

Eric Handler

Thank you.

Operator

Our next question is from Alex Perry with Bank of America.

Alexander Perry

Hi, thanks for taking my questions here and congrats on a strong quarter. Good morning Gina. I just wanted to bridge some of your comments on the segment guide. So the outlook for CP is unchanged, but now factoring in bigger levels of industry declines, I think you were at sort of flat to down 4% last time in the CP top line guide you raised the Wizards top line guide pretty significantly op margins come up. But reiterated consolidated four full company guide I guess is the puts and takes like a lower CP implied up margin offset by the higher Wizards op profit contribution. Like I just wanted to make sure, we're sort of clear on, the segment puts and takes. Thanks.

Gina Goetter

Yes, good question. I mean I think that we spelled out Wizards, so that's and that should be pretty clear of where we're rising both, we're raising both the revenue outlook and the operating margin outlook. In terms of CP, we're leaving it unchanged just given the wide range in potential outcome here. So when you think of the net impact of $60 million to $180 million, if it's on that higher end of the range of $180 million, you'll see higher revenue loss and you'll see those operating margins. To your point they're going to come down in the mid-single-digit range.

We just can't absorb the entirety of the cost impact in the margin structure. But if you go to the other end of the range, if we net out there, if the trade policy kind of starts to calm down a bit, if we don't see as much negative reaction from consumers or our customer order patterns or if we end on that lower end of the range, we stay then within spitting distance of our original guide. So that's why right now we just don't have enough clarity to narrow that down any further.

Hopefully by the time we get to July we're able to provide a bit more precision there. But it's a pretty wide guide. But I think how you said it in terms of mid-single-digits on CP and then you've got the Wizards, both the Wizards upside as well as trying to accelerate all of these cost savings in the pipeline. That's what's helping to absorb it.

Alexander Perry

Really helpful. And then just my follow-up question, I wanted to circle back on price. What parts of the portfolio do you have the most ability to raise price? Would you ever consider price increases on parts of the portfolio that seem like they have significant momentum right now like MAGIC or will it all be concentrated in the Tor portfolio where you're seeing the most tariff exposure?

Chris Cocks

I think we're going to pick and choose. So pricing is ultimately going to be a discussion with our retail partners and ultimately what price ends up on shelf is up to them. We're going to work hard to try to figure out how to hit those MAGIC price points for the items that we think are most exciting and or minimize any price increases associated with hot items that we think have a lot of good innovation. So we've got a lot of cool products coming out this fall. We're refreshing the entire Peppa Pig line with the new baby on the way. We think Play-Doh Barbie is the most exciting new innovation to hit the arts and crafts category, potentially ever.

We think that's a huge collaboration and happy to be partnering with Mattel on it. Likewise, we have a lot of opportunities across board games and games. MAGIC is really on fire. I think our default is to not pass on price wherever possible and instead to drive share and drive shelf space opportunities. That said, we are going to have to raise prices inside of 145% tariff regime with China. We're just trying to do it as selectively as possible and minimize the burden to the fans and families that we serve.

Alexander Perry

Perfect. That's incredibly helpful. Best of luck going forward.

Gina Goetter

Thanks Alex. Have a good day.

Our next question is from Stephen Laszcyzk with Goldman Sachs.

Stephen Laszcyzk

Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Curious if you'd update us a little bit more on the conversations maybe you're having at this point with retailers going into holiday. I imagine most retailers are trying to stay as flexible as they can for as long as they possibly can ahead of any potential reprieve on the tariff side. Could you just remind us maybe of the timing of how that plays out throughout the year and maybe when is the last possible moment that retailers would need to make it to decision around holiday orders as we head into late summer, early fall?

Gina Goetter

Yes. Good morning, Stephen. Yes, very fluid is how I would describe discussions with our retailers. And to your point right now, in this moment where we're sitting in April, the holidays are a long ways away. So when you think about order patterns, what we are planning for, and I think Chris said it in Q&A here that already this morning we're planning for Q2 to have a pretty material shift in both kind of DI versus DOM as the retailers themselves are managing their inventories.

So some of that order pattern, that anticipated order pattern that we'd see in Q2 does look different as we think about the back half of the year when we can model out our revenue, there's not a material change in terms of the back half of the year really represents about still call it 60%, 65% of our revenue base. We expect our inventory to then kind of be more moving out from us to our retailers to be more back half loaded into Q3 and Q4. We don't see any material change in how retailers are thinking about the holidays.

But to your point, they are making decisions right now. Do I take it here in May and June or do I wait until we're closer to the holiday resets which are going to happen in call it September, October. So that's how we've contemplated our phasing. That's what is all embedded in our guide in the range of outcomes.

But if you think about what CP is going to look like in Q2, it's going to be a down quarter for us just given the change in in the order patterns there. And then we kind of build back as we move through Q3, Q4.

Stephen Laszcyzk

Thanks, that's really helpful. And then maybe one on Monopoly Go!. It looks like revenues accelerated here in the first quarter. Curious. If you could just speak a little bit more to the momentum you're seeing there. What's been working so well to keep that IP going and then any updates to your outlook in terms of the decay you're factoring into the guidance?

Well, I think first and foremost, Scopely has made a fantastic game based on a fantastic brand. So it's very sticky. They're having excellent player engagement. They're doing good events with major partners. They just announced a new one with Star Wars which I think kicks off in a month or so.

So they've just been doing a really good job and I think they're getting to a more mature place in terms of, how much they have to spend in terms of driving new player engagement, new player adoption, which is what, which was a favorable aspect of the quarter for us. I think our previous guidance of about $10 million a month in terms of what we'll make is fair for the balance of the year and what we're currently modeling in our outlook.

Stephen Laszcyzk

Great, thank you both.

Our next question is from Jaime Katz with Morningstar.

Jaime Katz

Hey, good morning. I just want to ask a quick question on POS, which was in the back of the document of the slide deck today. I guess I'm trying to triangulate the strong revenue performance with sort of weaker market share performance and I'm wondering if maybe that's a function of just decreasing inventories or working down inventories at retail or is there something else maybe that I'm missing?

Chris Cocks

We entered the year with pretty lean inventories with our retail partners. And so there is an opportunity. There would be kind of what I would say on that.

Gina Goetter

Yes, our CP performance in the first quarter was the toy part of it was pretty on our planned expectation. As Chris said, we didn't have anything crazy in terms of having a clear inventory and promotional and promotions like that because we came into the year pretty healthy. Licensing was what drove the upside on revenue in the quarter.

Jaime Katz

Okay, and then can you talk a little bit about what you guys are seeing at value price points? I think from other consumer discretionary firms. We're just hearing incremental weakness across that consumer base. Thanks.

Chris Cocks

I don't think we have any real thunderous insights to share with you right now in terms of what the consumer behavior is. Generally speaking, toys as a category did pretty well in first quarter and Easter kind of went off as expected. So I think people are continuing to buy toys. Personally, I don't think we're seeing any indication that people are pulling forward like holiday buys or summer buys. Toys tend to be an occasion based purchase or a purchase of passion and consumers are behaving normally.

Jaime Katz

Thanks so much.

Our next question is from Kylie Cohu with Jefferies.

Kylie Cohu

Hey, good morning you guys and thanks for taking my question. All of the color around the CP exposure is super-duper helpful, but I was wanting to dig into the Wizards exposure a little more. I know it seems, but I do believe you do source some from Japan, but I was curious if there were any other countries to call out or details to add for rest of the world for that segment specifically.

Gina Goetter

Yes, the exposure for Wizards/MAGIC is pretty minimal and it's embedded in the Wizards Bar in the bar chart embedded in the Wizards Guide. So on a kind of 12-month basis, call it $5 million to $10 million-ish of exposure. To your point, we do manufacture in Japan. We do also manufacture over in Europe a bit. The bulk of the manufacturing is coming from the U.S.

Chris Cocks

Yes. The only thing in Wizards that we import from China is like D&D box sets. So that's actually where. That's actually a bigger input on the tariff duties I mentioned for Wizards than like the Japanese duties for MAGIC.

Kylie Cohu

No, that is super helpful. And then just kind of following back up on the POS trends, I think. you mentioned that licensing did better than expected, but I was just curious, like, what were those bright spots specifically? That would just be helpful and kind of what did you see? Anything around Easter, obviously there was a timing shift this year. Anything that performs particularly well?

Chris Cocks

Well on licensing, certainly My Little Pony continued to perform well and had a favorable year over year comp. Monopoly Go! is doing quite well. And then in terms of POS for our brands, we had Transformers was up, Dual Master, sorry, Beyblade was up. We had a good quarter in terms of Marvel. Those would probably be like the big bright spots for us on POS.

Kylie Cohu

Awesome, super helpful. Thank you.

Chris Cocks

All right, thanks, Kylie.

Gina Goetter

Thank you.
