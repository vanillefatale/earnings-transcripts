Our first question comes from Greg Konrad with Jefferies.

Greg Konrad
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Maybe just one on programs. I think you announced that you got 2 more BADGER units in the quarter. Can you just remind us how you're thinking about the current schedule of SCAR and maybe how that contributes to the expected ramp for that program?

Wahid Nawabi
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Sure. So Greg, as I mentioned in my remarks, we did secure an additional task order and award from the U.S. Space Force for additional BADGERS -- 2 more additional BADGERS. The whole SCAR program, as we mentioned in our comments before, has been so far in a customer-funded development process. We're shifting now from development activity to delivering products, most of which is going to end up eventually going into our firm fixed price contracts. That transition not only ramps up the revenue for the second half of the year, but also improves the margin profile of that business. So we're very much on track with our plans. We're pleased with the performance so far, and we expect the margins as well as the revenue of that business to actually improve in the third and fourth quarter of this year and continue to improve beyond this fiscal year.

Greg Konrad
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

And then maybe just one follow-up to that. I mean I think you talked about a couple of the headwinds that you saw in the quarter around profitability, including Oracle and the shutdown. If you kind of think about that ramp of profitability and margin given the 70% in Q4, how are you thinking about that progression? How much is operating leverage versus maybe mix and just the biggest drivers that you see as you head into the second half?

Kevin McDonnell
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Well, I think mix is going to be a big part of that. As Wahid just mentioned about the BADGER program and going into fixed price product revenues, some of our other programs and LOCUST and things like this being product revenues and a ramp-up in delivering across the other business units, increasing the proportion of product revenues versus service revenues. We don't see the service revenues growing significantly in the second half, whereas the product revenues are going to drive most of that growth. So that's going to give us better mix, and that's why we're going to be able to achieve the high 30s adjusted gross margins by the fourth quarter.

Wahid Nawabi
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

And Greg, let's also keep in mind that we have secured nearly $3.5 billion worth of almost all sole-sourced IDIQ contracts that allows us now to receive task orders underneath those contracts once the funding from the Big Beautiful Bill and the budgets for the Department of War comes through as a result of the shutdown that has been delayed, those product revenues are going to -- and task orders is going to be received in the next 1 or 2 months. That's what we expect, and we want to convert those to revenue. So the volume goes up, the mix improves and also the profile of the profitability of some of these products and businesses are going to improve, and that's precisely what we expected at the beginning of the fiscal year.

Our next question is from Ronald Epstein with Bank of America.

Samantha Stiroh
BofA Securities, Research Division

This is Samantha Stiroh, on for Ron today. I was wondering if you could -- in the past, you've given a breakout of -- by product in the portfolio. I was wondering if you had any color there or if you could talk a little bit about the relative growth levels by product?

Kevin McDonnell
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Well, I mean, we try to give as much granular -- we've improved our granularity this quarter by giving you further breakout of the different major product groupings for each segment. And so I tried to give some color behind that, that shows what products are driving the different growth in those different product categories. So there are kind of combinations of products, obviously, but we're trying to provide more color for you that. Was there something specific you were wondering about?

Samantha Stiroh
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just if you could talk about Switchblade growth. I think you mentioned Ukraine, if there's any color you could provide there?

Kevin McDonnell
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I mean, year-over-year, Switchblade by far is the fastest-growing product in the CUAS precision strike category. Overall, we saw significant growth multiple X for the JUMP20 in Q2 versus the prior year.

Operator

Our next question comes from Anthony Valentini with Goldman Sachs.

Anthony Valentini
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

It seems pretty obvious that you guys have massive growth opportunities here across the 5 to 10 different products that you guys have been highlighting. But maybe to like put a finer point on it, is there a way to think through the catalyst path over the next few months as some of the reconciliation funding starts to hit backlogs? Like what should people be looking for?

Wahid Nawabi
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Anthony, yes, of course, I'd be glad to provide some more color there. We certainly have a significant amount of opportunity for growth and value creation here in the next -- not only just a couple of quarters, but next few years. We're positioned really, really well. If you look at the key catalysts for growth, loitering munition, of course, we continue to grow that category, the Switchblade and One-Way Attack drones that are in that bucket. Our RF Counter-UAS solutions, the Titan family of products is another contributor of significant growth year-over-year.

Our medium UAS product line, which is JUMP20 and JUMP20X is another category of strong growth and contributor to our growth in general as well as profitability. Our P550, we expect significant orders for that in the third and fourth quarter of this year. The U.S. Army is intending to purchase a lot. There's a lot of dollars in the budget for that, and we expect to have a fairly large share of that spend with the U.S. Army. And we are also lining up a bunch of international customers for that product line. The SCAR and BADGER program and product is also transitioning to production, and we're going to deliver more seal numbers, and we're going to ramp up revenue. The profile of that revenue is higher margin as well as the volume is higher. That helps.

So in a nutshell, if you look across our portfolio, we've got growth across almost every one of our key product lines. Some of them are contributing to some smaller extent versus larger ones, but they're all growing quite rapidly. One area that may not grow as much is our cybersecurity business, and that's primarily because of it's a customer-funded engineering services and software solution business that really doesn't ramp up aggressively in terms of growth.

But overall, we're very pleased with the performance. We're looking for multiple quarters and years of growth. We're positioned really well with the shift in the U.S. DoD and the administration strategies. The kind of business model and products and go-to-market strategy that we have is precisely what the U.S. Department of War is looking for, and we're positioned incredibly well. There's going to be a lot of money spent. It is really hard to predict exactly how much. There's a lot of demand coming our way, and we're getting ready for it as we speak.

Kevin McDonnell
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I mean we think we're on the precipice of some significant growth across all those categories. But as with anything in defense, it's difficult to predict the exact timing of that. But we definitely think we're very close to some breakthroughs on some of these products Wahid mentioned.

Anthony Valentini
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. That's helpful. I appreciate all that color. One other quick one. I guess I'm just curious, like how do we square that with -- if I'm looking at the backlog in 1Q versus 2Q, it's slightly down. So I just -- can you guys help me understand like why that's the case? And should we see the backlog is like significantly ramping into the back half of the year? Or is it just so unpredictable? It's more that you guys have a feel over the next 12 to 18 months versus the next 6?

Kevin McDonnell
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Well, I think it's pretty flat from Q1 in terms of the funded backlog. The unfunded backlog grew significantly. But remember, we were in the CR and the shutdown. So while we got many of these contracts through, which was great, a lot of them didn't come with significant funding, and we expect that to be coming as they get back and are funding back to business on funding new contracts within the Department of War. So it's a little bit of an issue with the shutdown happening and delay in some of the actual funding on these contracts.

Anthony Valentini
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And Kevin, do you have a number for like what you guys expect Switchblade to be in 2026? I know that you guys gave the color on what the production capacity will be out of the Utah facility in the future. But is there a way for us to think about the 2026 forecast?

Kevin McDonnell
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

I don't think we're not really giving specific guidance on the different products. But I think we've talked about before roughly $500 million of capacity before we increase to the new facility. So you can go plus or minus that probably.

Our next question comes from Louie DiPalma with William Blair.

Louie Dipalma
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Wahid, what was the tone from the Reagan Defense Forum over the weekend? And are you increasingly confident given all of the presentations of AeroVironment's positioning across your different product lines, whether it's your drones, your attack drones, the electronic warfare and space?

Wahid Nawabi
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Louie, I personally attended the Reagan National Defense Forum this past weekend. The overall sentiment is that we are the role model company that the U.S. Department of War and the current administration wants to see a lot more of. We're setting the pace for everyone else. The procurement strategies are shifting to companies that develop things on their own dime. They're doing it ahead of product program requirements. They're doing it at agile and warp speeds. And then we're transitioning it to production quickly. They're focused -- we're focused on all the right areas what the U.S. Department of War needs and has major capability gaps.

These are critical areas of gap, capability gap, and it's required for the future defense of U.S. and our allies. We believe we're positioned incredibly well, and I think we're going to see continued demand to come our way because of the fact that we can also produce at scale today. We're one of the very, very few companies in these categories that actually has the capacity today and continue to expand it even further to deliver reliable, battle-proven products to our customers at scale. That is a huge competitive advantage that we have compared to everyone else in the market. And we're setting the pace for everybody. So I think the sentiment is very positive and strong for AV.

Louie Dipalma
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Excellent. And on this call, you've discussed many of your product lines such as the P550, your BADGER with the SCAR program, your JUMP20s. I was wondering, did your Long-Haul Laser Communications program from the undisclosed customer, was that contract recently upsized from $240 million to $385 million. It shows a larger number in your slide presentation. And I was also wondering, have you started delivering terminals as part of that program?

Wahid Nawabi
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

So Louie, I can only speak to that program at a very high level due to the sensitivity of that program and customer. We are incredibly delighted and pleased with the success that we're having in Long-Haul Laser Communication terminal. Essentially, we all know from the conflicts of Ukraine that RF communication is very susceptible to jamming. Every satellite that the U.S. has in space essentially is susceptible to that jamming problem.

If we cannot control and talk to our satellites, especially in the geosynchronous satellites, we've got a major problem. Those assets are not useful. And we are one of the only companies that we know of that has been awarded a contract to this magnitude, up to $240 million to actually provide the laser communication terminals to overhaul and upgrade the U.S. geosynchronous satellite constellation for national security. That is a massive, massive step forward for a company in our nation. And we beat many of the major prime contractors in that competition.

And so there is certainly a lot more upside on that contract because we're just beginning to deliver systems. We haven't delivered much yet. We continue to work with the customer. Our system is performing really well, and it takes a while for that to happen. That's part of the program. So we're very excited, and there are options for them to increase that significantly.

Kevin McDonnell
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. The $381 million includes the options as we put forth our new definitions here to make sure we're all on the same page. That $240 million was the original committed contract and the $380 million was taking the options.

Louie Dipalma
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Great. And so as part of the original committed contract, does that mean that -- is it funded already?

Wahid Nawabi
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

No. So Louie, vast majority of that contract is not funded yet. As Kevin said earlier, one of the reasons why our funded backlog is nearly the same as last quarter, and it did not grow as much is because there's 2 things that has happened. One, the government shutdown put employees of the government not coming to the office and being able to actually put contracts and award things, one. But the bigger problem was that because of the continuing resolution in the budget that just passed with the Big Beautiful Bill, those dollars have not made it into the accounts of our customers to be able to then award task orders against those IDIQs.

So we expect a significant number of additional funded task orders in Q3 and Q4, all of which is going to improve our backlog and will allow us to deliver more products and more revenue in third and fourth quarter this year. Additionally, it will set us up really well for fiscal year '27. We're not ready to provide any guidance for that yet, but that is going to be benefiting from the demand that's coming our way in terms of task orders and more funding.

Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets.

Peter Schaffrik
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

This is Pete Schaffrik, on for Ken Herbert. Could you maybe discuss the margin profile of the SCD&E segment? Is there maybe a time when you think that the adjusted EBITDA will be breakeven?

Kevin McDonnell
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. It will continue to grow throughout the year. I mean they were probably the most impacted by the government shutdown of any of our businesses. And they also had some delays in some of their receipts for their revenue recognition on their systems. So they'll definitely be on track as we move forward throughout the year.

Wahid Nawabi
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

And Peter, also, we strongly believe in that business. It is a very profitable, reliable, consistent business and business model. Both of those 2 businesses in the long run are going to be profitable like they were in the past. There are going to be just these lumps of fluctuations that happen, but the business' models are sound. They're very reliable in that regard, and we expect them to actually improve in Q3 and Q4 as we go forward.

Kevin McDonnell
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

And their product mix is going to increase over their service mix. So that is going to drive their EBITDA margins up.

Peter Schaffrik
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

And I'm assuming the next piece of my question kind of goes hand in hand. But can you talk about the free cash for maybe the second half of the year? Or do you have a kind of a full year outlook for it as well?

Kevin McDonnell
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Well, we've always tried to say that we can get our EBITDA cash conversion over 50% is the goal for the year. And I still believe that's an achievable goal.

Our next question comes from Andre Madrid with BTIG.

Andre Madrid
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to dive a little bit deeper into the almost $900 million Army contract, IDIQ that you guys got. I think the initial award had said that it was pretty much exclusively small UAS and then you guys announced earlier this week that it also included CUAS, namely the Titan. I mean, can you tell us more about what the international opportunity looks like for the CUAS platforms? I think this is about one of the first times we've really heard about it. Also, can LOCUST be sold internationally? And then I guess also broadly, just how should we think about the margin distinction between domestic and international CUAS sales?

Wahid Nawabi
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

So Andre, yes, the nearly $900 million sole-sourced IDIQ contract, multiyear, of course, from the U.S. Army for our products, now includes Raven, Puma AE, Puma LE, but we could also sell our Titan Counter-UAS solutions as well as potentially in the future, the LOCUST Directed Energy solutions. This is a significant milestone because the U.S. Army could have purchased these things under the existing contracts that we have, but they chose to actually add an additional contract with an additional $900 million nearly ceiling for it to allow us to deliver more products over the next couple of 3 to 4 years to our international customers. So that's a very positive news.

Secondly, the margins for international sales historically and in the future will continue to be slightly more favorable than the domestic markets. Those customers do not buy as much as U.S. DoD and generally, the margins are a little bit better. If we sell FMS, the margins are not a lot better. The best margins are international DCS sales. But FMS has less expenses, too, because we do not have the responsibility for exporting it. The U.S. military does. So we deliver the product to the U.S. military and they deliver that to the customer -- the international customer.

The market opportunity internationally is massive for us. Really, we're at the beginning phases of that for our Counter-UAS, for directed energy, for our Switchblade for our One-Way Attack and for our SCAR-BADGER systems that we have in our product portfolio. We're just scratching the surface on those items, and some of them are literally just starting with no international sales. The area we're really strong is our small UAS, but we've got tremendous potential here. I expect the international market over the next several years to grow significantly and be a major contributor.

Andre Madrid
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Got it. That's super helpful. And then maybe just to pivot to Switchblade. I think you said that by next year, you could support capacity of $2 billion in sales. I think previously, the number that you had disclosed was about $1 billion. I just wanted to see what might be driving that difference?

Wahid Nawabi
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Sure. So Andre, as we keep building these new factories, we're also improving a lot in terms of automation and ability for us to produce and ramp up production. So we're -- as you know, we're ramping up production for Switchblade significantly already. We've already tripled -- doubled and tripled every year for the last couple of years. And we're going to continue to improve it even further.

The new facility that we have now in Salt Lake City, which is going to come online later next calendar year -- towards the end of next calendar year, has the potential to go above $2 billion worth of production with multiple shifts. If we get to that level, it's going to be well over a $2 billion factory. And I expect that to even go higher than that because there's so much more potential room for growth in terms of our automation and efficiencies in the production processes.

Last thing I want to mention about that is that, that factory is also very flexible. We could produce any variance of Switchblade, but we could also produce other products such as our One-Way Attack product solutions and our non-lethal UAS and other platforms that we have such as Freedom Eagle-1, et cetera, et cetera. So we're setting the factory to be flexible and agile for lots of our products, and we can shift production on that factory as we go forward.

Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Walsh with Citizens.

Trevor Walsh
Citizens JMP Securities, LLC, Research Division

Maybe just touching on AVHalo a little bit. Wahid, great to see the new products or the new, I guess, modules being added on to that. Can you maybe just take a step back, though, around that whole product opportunity? Just given all the different systems from both AV as well as the other providers in the ecosystem that you're partnering and OEMing with and they're able to kind of link in. How much of that still just needs to work its way through the system in terms of getting those systems out into the field so that the customer can actually just know what's the right sort of overall software package to go with those?

I guess it's another way of asking kind of you have these wins around AVHalo now, but is there really a kind of much wider opportunity that's kind of going to, I guess, materialize later again, once the actual hardware piece is a little bit more locked down, I guess. Does that make sense?

Wahid Nawabi
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Yes, of course, Trevor. So let me provide you some color on that. First of all, I'm really excited about the AVHalo suite of software solutions. It's not just one particular product. Think of it as a very robust and broad portfolio of solution sets, a software stack and an ecosystem that provides lots and lots of different capabilities with different modules, such as AV_Halo COMMAND, AV_Halo CORTEX, AV_Halo PINPOINT, et cetera, et cetera.

So we launched 2 new modules, number one, and we're going to continue to launch more new modules to that. And the best way to think about it in a very simplistic way is like the Microsoft Office suite of products: Excel, Word, Outlook, all these different modules are underneath the Office suite, right? The same thing applies to AV_Halo. AV_Halo has several modules. In terms of deployment, we already have thousands, if not tens of thousands of some of the modules already deployed in the field. That is the beauty of our system that is all interoperable and integrated. And so what we've done is try to actually bring the ecosystem cohesively together and mesh it all together under one umbrella of software solution.

Secondly, it is also a very open architecture. We can integrate with any other platform, including competitor platforms, and we can also talk to any other systems and other battle management systems. And so our belief is that our solution set is incredibly not well understood yet, and we have a long way to go in terms of the opportunity set here over the next several years.

One example of that success story is in my comments about the U.S. Army who selected us for the Human Machine Integrated Formation, HMIF program record. That is a very strategic and critical program. We competed with very large companies and small companies that are trying to copy our model, and we won. And U.S. Army selected us. That means that the future battle space on the edge of the battlefield, the systems and the controllers that they're going to use to operate these robotic systems, whether on the ground or air, on land or sea, it's going to be ours. And we are open, interoperable, and we will integrate with many other systems that are there. And so we got a lot more coming in this area, and I can't be more excited about it in the future.

Kevin McDonnell
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

And we already support multiple platforms with our AV Command.

Wahid Nawabi
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

We support not only our own platforms, we support more competitor platforms today than our own actually. And that's the testament that how open we are with our architecture and our platform for our customers. And that's one advantage that we have that most other systems are not that open.

Our next question comes from Jonathan Siegmann with Stifel.

Jonathan Siegmann
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Great work on managing the shutdown. I thought that was great. And it's a really interesting time with signals flashing green here with a lot of intent of where we want to spend money, but with the shutdown causing a real wrinkle. Historically, your January quarter hasn't been the strongest bookings quarter for you guys. I'm just wondering if there's going to be some additional frictions this year you anticipate that we just can't catch up with all this pent-up demand and funded order. Is that a worry for you guys?

Wahid Nawabi
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Yes, Jonathan, that's a very well put comment because the reason why we do not want to -- or we hesitated to raise the guidance even more is because there's still some timing risk on when we are going to get some of these task orders. The government came out of the shutdown, but still the budget for the fiscal year is not fully approved. We are funding until January -- end of January. And while we expect some task orders to come in, exactly when they're going to come in is anybody's guess.

And so therefore, we expect -- we are confident that we're going to achieve our guidance that we've just provided. And anything above and beyond that, we're going to update you as we go in the next quarter.

Lastly, we did very well. We are on track with our plans on first quarter and second quarter, and we are exactly where we wanted to be despite the fact that the whole industry was dealing with a month of complete government shutdown. And so I think our results are very good, and we're very pleased with our results, and we're looking forward to the second half of the year. We've got aggressive goals, but we're very confident that we can achieve that. We've got the capacity. We've got the team, and we've got the demand from the customer and the support from our customers to get it done.

Our next question comes from Austin Moeller with Canaccord.

Austin Moeller
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

Just my first question here. Can you discuss how much of the backlog today is related to Ukraine and when that might convert? And similarly, how much of the backlog is from European allies ex Ukraine?

Wahid Nawabi
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Well, Austin, we do not break down the specific backlog by customer regions or by specific products. What I can tell you is the following. We have derisked and pivoted from our 2 years ago Ukraine demand almost entirely. It represents less than 5% of our revenue for the full year, number one. Number two, so far, we're on track with our plans. And international demand is still back-end loaded a little bit. Because of the government shutdown and the contracting process, some of those FMS sales have not made it yet to actual contracts to us.

Do we continue to get contracts? Yes. But there's a lot more to come towards the second half as well as the next fiscal year. Overall, our backlog is pretty strong, $1.1 billion worth of funded backlog. We had a $1.4 billion worth of funded bookings. And I mean, very strong orders and backlog and visibility numbers given where we are with the quarter.

Kevin McDonnell
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. We've been saying consistently that Ukraine should be less than 10% of our revenue for the year, and there would be no additional orders in our guidance for Ukraine for this year. So if we did see some additional business in Ukraine, that would be positive for us. But we're not counting on any additional new orders for Ukraine.

Wahid Nawabi
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

On our forecast.

Kevin McDonnell
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

In our forecast.

Austin Moeller
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

Okay. And just a follow-up. I know the genesis of Red Dragon was to enable international sales by having an open payload bay that was payload agnostic and didn't have munition in it. But do you expect that Red Dragon could replace or take additional share from the Switchblade 600 over time with the U.S. military in a long-range anti-armor, anti-fixed installation role?

Wahid Nawabi
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Austin, no. The short answer for that question is no, we do not expect that to take share away from Switchblade, primarily because they're designed for very different mission sets. The missions that loitering munitions such as Switchblade 300, 600 and now 400 do are very different than the missions of One-Way Attack drones such as our Red Dragon. And our family of Red Dragon is expanding. We believe both of those 2 product lines are going to grow significantly over the next few years. The demand for those systems are very robust from more than one service and more than one customer in country. And so I think we're going to continue to see significant growth on both categories. They're actually complementary to each other in many ways as to how they engage with different targets and different missions for our customers.

Kevin McDonnell
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. In our current volumes, we're only going to see growth in all those products. Red Dragon could potentially grow faster, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's taking away share from the other Switchblade products.

Our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global.

Peter Skibitski
Alembic Global Advisors

Wahid, I just wonder if you could level set us. I'm still a little confused with where we're at with the Army Long Range Reconnaissance. I know that you guys as well as Edge both got contracts in August, and then you announced another award yesterday. Are you guys sole-sourced now on LRR with the P550? Or is there going to be kind of an ongoing competition over the next few years?

Wahid Nawabi
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

More the latter, Pete. So what the Army has done, and this is consistent with many programs within the U.S. Army and even other branches of the U.S. Department of War Services, is that the traditional construct and concept of a program of record single winner probably is not going to be that popular in that common.

What they're going to do is they're going to pick at least 2 players. And from those 2 players, they want to field some systems and see who performs better. As the performance of that system is better, that vendor or that supplier most likely is going to get the lion's share of the volume of that program or requirement or capability gap.

We believe our solution set is the best performing. We have very strong feedback from the customer that the customer is extremely satisfied with our systems. Yes, we announced a couple of orders and awards, but we expect more. We're actually expanding and ramping up production in anticipation of more P550 orders from the U.S. Army as well as additional international customers. We believe that the P550 product is a $1 billion-plus franchise for the company over the next several years. We are such a strong believer in that product. I am personally very, very high on that product.

Now in terms of going forward, is it going to be just us? Most likely not. Do we expect to get a very large share of that spend? Yes. We expect to get a large share of it. And that's probably going to be consistent across multiple programs, not just the LRR.

Peter Skibitski
Alembic Global Advisors

Got it. Okay. Very helpful. I appreciate that. And just on the P550 specifically, are you cleared to export that internationally already? And if so, how many countries can you export it to? And how do you expect that to grow?

Wahid Nawabi
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Yes, Pete, that's a great question. And that product line was developed from the ground up, number one, to be MOSA or Modular Open Systems Approach interoperable and compatible and compliant, a; two, it is developed primarily all with our own R&D dollars. So it's a non-ITAR product in its base configuration. There are modules within it that can make it ITAR, but we can -- we believe that we can sell the P550 to almost every customer that we sell, our Pumas and Ravens and other products today.

So the market for P550 internationally is equally as large, if not larger, than our domestic market. And I believe that we're going to have several customers internationally that's going to come online and place orders for that capability later this fiscal year and even beyond this fiscal year.

Our next question comes from Colin Canfield with Cantor.

Colin Canfield
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

Maybe just bringing it all home to cash and profitability. If we can kind of think about the building blocks of EBITDA, I think the 4Q guidance on adjusted EBITDA assumes roughly same ballpark as kind of combined full company pro forma results as last year. So maybe just kind of walk us through how you think of the progression on SG&A and essentially kind of how we think about that EBITDA step-up versus the supply chain kind of dynamics that you're focusing on?

And then bridging that over, I think Street is probably close to free cash flow breakeven this year. So is it fair to assume that kind of the timing and the shift that you talk about requires investment? Or is it fair to assume that this kind of quick book and turn -- or excuse me, shipping kind of book and ship business can allow you to hit something like that in terms of free cash flow?

Wahid Nawabi
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

So Colin, let me just add some color to this. We do expect Q4 to be the largest quarter. As we provided some color, almost 55% of our second half revenues are in the fourth quarter, number one. So the overall volume in fourth quarter is higher, number one. Number two, the mix keeps getting more favorable in the fourth quarter from Q1 to Q2 to Q3 and Q4. So that's also a positive trend that's affecting Q4.

We expect SG&A and R&D spending not to be a lot higher and not to be a lot lower. We're going to continue to maintain those levels, but the mix shift in the volume is going to help make the profitability much more pronounced in the fourth quarter in that regard. Now in terms of the overall outlook, we've provided the full year numbers on profitability, and we're confident that we're going to be able to achieve that.

Kevin McDonnell
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And I gave color in my script on SG&A and R&D and margins for the year. So that's really how you get there. It really comes from improved gross margins and some leverage on things like SG&A, partly because we get -- realized some of the synergies that we've established in the first half, but don't really realize the second half of the year. So -- and in terms of capacity, those numbers really represent where we're at in terms of capacity where we are increasing incrementally in many places in the second half or prior -- or even today, and that -- those are reflected in the numbers.

Colin Canfield
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

Got it. And just to clarify, is it fair to assume that your free cash flow breakeven this year?

Kevin McDonnell
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Well, we're looking for 50% -- it depends how you define all that, but we're looking at 50% cash conversion to our EBITDA.

Wahid Nawabi
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

For the year.

Kevin McDonnell
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

For the year.

Wahid Nawabi
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Which is a significant improvement over last year.

Kevin McDonnell
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes, which is a big improvement. So basically, that's EBITDA less our CapEx, less our working capital change from EBITDA.

Next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird.

Peter Arment
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Wahid, could you -- maybe we'll just touch upon the cash comment that you guys just talked about. Your Precision Strike kind of product revenues were up 68% for the first 6 months of this year, but unbilled continues to grow. And I thought we were under a new contractor payments schedule. Could you maybe give us a little more color what's going on there?

Kevin McDonnell
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I mean as we've talked in many quarters, there's been a whole transition period there. There's been some changes in our contracting office, our contracting personnel that have all been positive. And at this point, we feel like we have a clear runway to continue to start bringing that down the second half of this year. And -- plus we have this -- we do -- as we mentioned in the script, we are -- the amount of unbilled business is significant, particularly with the service businesses.

Wahid Nawabi
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

And the revenue over time -- portion of our overall revenue is also increasing primarily because of the BlueHalo. And so that also is playing a factor in this equation, Peter. And just one other comment to make on this topic is that we're really more focused on the top line growth and making sure that we capture the opportunities and not lose momentum on the significant upside that we have in our long-term plan.

So we're really optimizing to make sure that we deliver for our customers, we deliver capabilities, develop the products. We're anticipating a lot more task orders in the second half of the year. And so we have to really start building products in advance. We can't wait until the last moment. And while we're taking not all the risk, but we are taking some calculated risk to position ourselves to deliver for our customers because we know that they need these systems very desperately.

Peter Arment
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. So just to be clear, you expect unbilled to be probably materially lower as we get through the fourth quarter, just given your comments about cash conversion on EBITDA?

Kevin McDonnell
Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Right. It's pretty simple. We have the $300 million to $320 million of EBITDA range. CapEx should be roughly a little bit less than half of that. So in order to hit 50% cash conversion on EBITDA, the change in working capital has to be minimal, and that's what we're forecasting.

The question comes from Austin Bohlig with Needham.

Austin Bohlig
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Congrats on the nice order flow-through even with the government shutdown. But my question has to do with kind of the full year guide and with this anticipated funding coming from the OBD. Is it fair to assume that anything that flows through that you're expecting is not yet baked into your current full year guidance?

Wahid Nawabi
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

No. Austin, we are expecting and we're expecting multiple task orders and orders on the second half that we believe we're going to be able to convert that to revenue. In order for us to overperform is going to be more difficult because of the timing, how long it takes to go build those products, get them tested and accepted by the customer and then deliver to our customers. So we're confident about our full year guidance, number one. Number two, we do expect contract awards and task orders in the second half that will convert to revenue and that's part of our forecast, and we're confident that we can achieve that.

Austin Bohlig
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Got you. Got you. And then just kind of some specifics on kind of like where are you hoping that these new contracts come from within your product portfolio? Is this Precision Strike, UAS, Counter-UAS?

Wahid Nawabi
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

So Austin, it's a very nice, nice portfolio or basket of contracts and awards that we expect. It's basically the critical areas that the U.S. DoD needs them desperately and we've been talking about. So P550, more Switchblade, more One-Way Attack, more Counter-UAS, more Directed Energy, more SCAR and BADGERS. And those are the key areas that we expect more of in our second half of the year. There's obviously orders for Cyber and other businesses, too, but those 5 or 6 categories make up the lion's share of the expected additional contract awards and task orders for the second half.

Our next question comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries with Piper Sandler.

Clarke Jeffries
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

I wanted to ask, Wahid, how do the recent changes to missile technology control and the treatment of UAS affect the current AeroVironment portfolio and maybe even how your posture might change for the future product portfolio. Did any of those changes have any direct impact on the $870 million IDIQ? It sounds like maybe there was some Counter-UAS focus to that contract, but curious there. And then any other key policy changes you'd flag as crucial for growing the international business?

Wahid Nawabi
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Sure. So we expect -- first of all, the comment about the change in policy, absolutely. We believe that the new policy and definition that the U.S. Department of War and government came up with how they categorize drones and how they categorize Loitering Munitions and One-Way Attack is very favorable to us because they're trying to relax the definitions as to how it's treated versus a true missile that goes very long, long distances and it's categorized as a missile. So arm drone or on an FPV even is not categorized the same. That is going to help us significantly over the next 2 to 3 years. It's not really immediate, but it is over the next 2 to 3 years.

Secondly, yes, the sole-sourced nearly $900 million IDIQ is directly related to that because the U.S. DoD and the Department of War expects us to ship a lot of products because of the demand that they see from different allies. Obviously, the U.S. Department of War is in contact with those international customers, and they see the uptick in demand for our solutions. So we do expect that to happen. But most of that is not going to happen overnight. It's still a process that takes some time, and we work it. Overall, we feel very positive about the general demand for our solutions from international markets including Direct Energy, Counter-UAS, One-Way Attack, Loitering Munition, P550, JUMP20.
