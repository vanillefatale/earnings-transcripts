Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions]. Our first call from today will come from the line of Scott Buck of H.C. Wainwright & Company.

Scott Buck
H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division

Andy, I'm curious, is there -- or was there a particular catalyst that's helping drive the higher level of demonstrations and activity here in the last couple of months, either something external or maybe some change in the selling process?

Andrew Leaver
CEO & Director

Scott, good question. Thank you. So I kind of look -- when I kind of laid out where we're seeing business, I would say kind of thematically, what you're seeing is the news flow on quantum and the advances in quantum this year, this calendar year 2025 have been huge. And I think when you see some of the larger players like -- sorry, like IBM and Google, when they talk about their hybrid computers and achieving quantum supremacy and then you also see some of the smaller pure players, which we see a lot, by the way, I think their advances have gotten people to say, hey, we can see now that quantum is moving very quick, and we're still actually in the year of quantum. So that's the first thing that they're seeing.

I would say thematically, I think also then what we're also seeing is you'll see specifically within the telecom sector is a larger awareness because of -- I talked about in my notes earlier that in some cases, governments, in other cases, regulatory bodies saying to people, this needs to be on your risk register, and this is something you need to look at. And I think that's driving a lot of organizations starting with telco to say, "Hey, we need to have a position on this, and we need to understand the potential impact and how we can mitigate against that impact. "

So on one side, it's hugely exciting about quantum arriving in the way that it is because it's a force for good. We all know the benefits of quantum. But in a bad actor's hands, now people are starting to be aware of what the consequences of that are. I would just leave you with one other thing as well. I think it's very well publicized now the threat of what's being called harvest now decrypt later, which is people having their information packed and stolen today to be decrypted later when quantum computing becomes available in a more meaningful way.

If that information has a shelf life or has any sort of validity going into the future, then it puts that organization at risk. And I think people are saying, "hey, we need to guard against that now rather than wait for more and more evidence in terms of the availability of quantum computers. " Hopefully, that helps, Scott.

Scott Buck
H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division

No, that's very helpful. It sounds like the market is coming to you guys rather than you having to change any of your kind of internal selling procedures to grab more attention, which is great. I also want to ask about Encryption Intelligence. What does the sales cycle look like there versus the legacy product? I would imagine it's significantly shorter and maybe a driver of revenue here in the near term.

Andrew Leaver
CEO & Director

Yes. We're really pleased with the acquisition we made of Encryption Intelligence. For us, this is something that ability to, one, in a sales cycle, show an organization their cryptographic landscape and show where they have potential weaknesses and potential problems in their network, but also identify that against existing regulatory body guidance.

But right behind that is we obviously want organizations to use this as an ongoing tool as well to keep themselves safe against any new attacks. So we're seeing starting particularly with telco operators then leaning into this and saying, "hey, this is something that we'd like to use on an ongoing basis. " So we're in discussion now with a number of telco operators, not just to do an initial check on their network, but also then on an ongoing basis for them to use the tool.

I like the fact now that we can be very specific about what the threat is and be very deterministic about what we can do to help them mitigate against that potential attack and vulnerability. I think this year, as I said, being the Euro Quantum, we just have a lot more inbound on that side as opposed to before where we were talking about in the market. The market feels like it's a lot more educated now is coming to us.

Scott Buck
H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division

Yes. No, that makes sense. I'm curious, Andy, are there additional kind of bolt-on or tuck-in opportunities similar to that asset purchase you made back in May that might make sense to, I don't know, either bring in some additional revenue or expand the potential customer footprint?

Andrew Leaver
CEO & Director

Yes. That's a really good question. And I talked about what we're seeing, particularly with data sovereignty and confidential compute. And I think those 2 areas are really coming to the fore now, particularly as you think about a lot of organizations are now thinking about in that kind of detect, protect comply, where is my data going? How do I need to think about complying against local regulation and then how do I protect it.

So anyone that sits on the periphery of really detect, protect comply around data sovereignty and confidential compute would be great tuck-ins for us. I think anything around particular tech components of that would be interesting. And we've looked at a few different areas already in terms of people that are delivering components of it, but are obviously missing the deep intellectual property that we have around the quantum-safe part of it as well. So absolutely, we'll be looking in the market.

Scott Buck
H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division

Great. And then if I can squeeze one more in, and this is probably for Nick. Curious, should we anticipate any change in OpEx for fiscal '26? Or can you support the anticipated growth in the business with this kind of current level of OpEx spend?

Nicholas Pointon
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So we are -- our plan is very much to maintain the cost control that we benefited from in FY '24 and to keep at the -- sorry, '25 and to keep the same level in FY '26, so $2.5 million per month is our sort of target maximum cash spend per month that we anticipate ahead, and we believe we can deliver the year ahead within those constraints.

Operator

Our next question will be coming from the line of Troy Jensen of Cantor Fitzgerald.

Troy Jensen
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

Congrats on all the great progress here. Maybe, Andy, for you to start with, can we just touch on competition? It seems like 6, 12 months ago, there was really nobody -- the traditional security vendors talking about post-quantum security and now I hear them upgrading their algorithms and whatnot. So curious, is that just mainly software-based competition? Or I just curious if you could touch on the competitive dynamics.

Andrew Leaver
CEO & Director

Yes, sure. I mean, I think to -- in line with what we're seeing in interest and activity within the market, of course, there's going to be people that are going to look at this as something that they want to lean into as well. So we absolutely see a few different competing ideas in terms of how people view this and how they want to deliver it.

Just to kind of shine the spotlight back on us for a second, we've been at this for over 5 years. We've got 25 patents. We spent a lot of money deeply thinking about this problem and believe that we've got something very unique. And just to kind of quote a phrase, the gold standard was always symmetric key agreements, which have been used for a long, long time by governments, military, federal defense, et cetera, because that's what they trust.

And having a pure software solution that allows you to model that without hardware, without having to think about distributing keys and also the fact that it's not mathematical, anything that mathematical, obviously, a quantum computer eats up very, very easily. we believe that we've got something that's very light, very flexible, goes all the way to the edge of a network and extends itself into those kind of data sovereignty and also trusted domain conversations that we've been having. So hey, I'm sure there are people that will come along with slightly different views. We just want to make sure that we make it as frictionless and easy as possible in what we're doing, and that's what we just keep building on.

Troy Jensen
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

Perfect. Great answer. And then, Andy, also for you, just if you look at the success lately, it seems like it's been telco and government. I'm curious, can you just talk about the corporate side? It seems like this is something financial organizations and a variety of different kind of corporate American companies should be looking at.

Andrew Leaver
CEO & Director

Yes. That's a really good question, Troy. And we -- so I kind of feel like it's building a bit like the OSI stack if people know what that is kind of from the physical level upwards, as I talked about optical transport layers and things like that. The very basics are, "hey, let's protect the actual fundamentals of how things are connected together. " And I feel like now we're getting into the kind of more operational layers.

I feel like anybody that is regulated, is critical infrastructure, is heavy in intellectual property, people that are starting to talk to us. And I mentioned that we've done a briefing to a regulatory body in my prepared remarks. And you can see that now they're building their guidance saying, hey, this is obviously a threat to regulated financial industries. They're ones we're talking to at the moment. So we're seeing the people that are actually operating some of the infrastructure are thinking about how to protect that and also to protect against bad actors.

And then anybody that's doing anything that's rich in IP that they've got long development cycles. So you could think about farmers, life sciences, chemicals companies, they're the people that want to protect their IP as well. Because obviously, if there's a harvest now decrypt later, that's got a long shelf life because they're years into development of that. So those are the industries we're seeing coming along next and starting to have conversations with them.

The secure compute really leans into financial services as well, obviously being a regulated industry. So we see those kind of going hand in glove really. Hopefully, that makes sense.

Operator
