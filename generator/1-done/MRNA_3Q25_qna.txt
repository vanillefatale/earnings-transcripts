[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs.

Salveen Richter
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

As we look to the expense management on the forward here, can you help us understand what's being deprioritized or changed to allow for these changes? And then secondly, in accordance with kind of Roivant and the IP dynamics that are playing out here, can you just frame your strategy here on the forward as we look to 2026?

James Mock
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. Salveen, thanks for the question. So I'll take the first one. So it depends on your reference point in terms of what you talk about from a cost-out perspective. Over the last few years, as I mentioned, we're down 50% from a cash cost basis. But if I'm more recent in our recent $500 million to $700 million reduction, that's split evenly across R&D and cost of sales. So cost of sales is purely driving efficiencies. Everything that the teams are hard at work and have been hard at work doing, they're just accelerating and getting it done faster.

So that's unutilized manufacturing capacity, that is all the waste that we saw in materials, they're doing a great job reducing that, driving productivity within the labor force. So that's not really a deprioritized investment. On R&D, it's a bit of both. The execution of our clinical trials has been much more efficient. We've talked in the past about the fact that we were operating for speed and this time, we are operating for cost as well and efficiency. So a lot of this is just the execution of our trials.

But we are making decisions here and there to not continue to advance to Phase II or Phase IIIs or even out of Phase I here and there. Broadly, we're taking down our -- just big picture story from the last couple of years. Our large Phase III vaccine trials are really running down and winding down, including CMV recently and flu combination vaccine. And after that, we are moving into oncology, which is a different amount of patients that are under those trials.

So there is some prioritization in there, as we've always said, but a lot of it is also execution, but we still have prioritized our pipeline. So we are excited about the 9 or 10 late-stage programs that we have that Stephen highlighted in his prepared remarks, and we look forward to continuing to take out additional costs, and we do see that coming down over the coming years, and we'll update you more at Analyst Day.

Stéphane Bancel
CEO & Director

On Arbutus, the trial in the U.S. is scheduled for March 9, 2026. We remain confident in the groundbreaking technology we pioneered, including our lipid nanoparticle delivery system. We are vigorously defending the case and responding to new filings outside the U.S. We believe that our technology does not infringe any valid patents asserted by Arbutus.

Our next question comes from Gena Wang with Barclays.

Huidong Wang
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Maybe 2 very quick questions. First one is regarding the U.S. COVID revenue, $781 million. I assume majority of this basically is the inventory buildup or delivery to the pharmacists. So maybe how often do you track pharmacies to maintain their inventory? And what additional color you can share regarding your estimate of the revenue for the remaining of this year? And then second question is regarding the CMS -- sorry, CMV vaccine. So what is the learning there? Why immunogenicity data did not translate to clinical benefit?

James Mock
Chief Financial Officer

Okay. So thanks, Gena. Good to hear from you. I'll take the U.S. sales. Yes. So ultimately, the end measure is vaccinations in the U.S. that is shots in arms. And so in the third quarter, yes, we ship a lot of our product into wholesalers and then they take it down to our end pharmacists, whether that's a retail pharmacy or an IDN network, a doctor or a physician's office. And so we track that almost daily. And really, what we put -- what Stephen shared with you on the screen is that's why we show shots in arms. We believe that's the ultimate measure.

And if you look at season to date through October 24, shots in arms are down in the U.S., 30%. There's a lot of reasons for that, some of which we anticipated. And if I take this back to our guidance, when we originally guided at the beginning of the year, we said $1.5 billion in the U.S. sales, $1 billion to $1.5 billion. The $1.5 billion was essentially flat year-over-year for all aspects, whether it's market share, competitive dynamics, vaccination rates, et cetera, excluding a onetime item from the prior year. And the $1 billion, as I said, is down 33%.

So we obviously anticipated that the vaccination rate, which is the largest variable here, could go down. And so now we've seen that go down, and we've reduced our range. So we said we believe vaccination rates will now be down 20% to 40%. And we are in the heart of the vaccination season, we're probably half to 2/3 of the way through. So we have good visibility to this. We are measuring shots in arms. We talked about our share as well. And we also look at every single day and every single week, is there more pull down? Is there more pull down to the physicians? Is there more pull down to retail? Are there more shipments even in the fourth quarter?

So -- and we feel very comfortable with our range now of $1 billion to $1.3 billion, but we do not see vaccination rates in the U.S. getting back to flat, which is the change from the high end from going from $1.5 billion to $1.3 billion.

Stephen Hoge
President

And Gena, I'll take the CMV question. So first, we really only have, at this point, the top line data from that trial. And over the coming weeks and months, we will get a tremendous amount of more information, including detailed information on a bunch of other on immunogenicity and potentially even correlative protection and have the ability to generate hypotheses on what maybe didn't work.

What I can say at this point is, as you know, going into the trial, we and the field had high hopes that a pentamer neutralizing antibody response, which had not been a part -- a strong pentamer neutralizing antibody response, which had not been a part of previous intismeran vaccine was going to be the missing piece for being able to prevent infection with a CMV vaccine. Prevention of infection with the herpes virus or in CMV was an incredibly high bar. It was a difficult bar to go after. But ultimately, the only one we thought that we could test that had a chance at meeting our target product profile for prevention of congenital CMV.

So I guess what we can say at this point until we get that additional data is it looks like pentamer neutralizing antibodies weren't the missing piece and that it wasn't sufficient by itself to drive a dramatic improvement in the prevention of infection with CMV. Now we'll dig into the data as we get it over the coming months. Obviously, look forward to publishing it, sharing it at medical conferences and hopefully, the entire field can learn where vaccine development in CMV might need to go next. But ultimately, pentamer wasn't enough.

Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with Evercore.

Cory Kasimov
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I shift gears over to the pipeline. I want to ask about your norovirus program. Are you surprised at all by the low case accruals here? Or is this kind of anticipated? And do you believe this offers any sort of reflection on the commercial opportunity or potential demand for the product should it be approved?

Stephen Hoge
President

Thanks for the question, Cory. So predicting epidemiology and norovirus is still an early space. And so we had always designed the study as a potential 2-season study. In fact, we're -- we'd always expected that it was possibly going to be necessary. That happens in flu vaccines. That has happened in other respiratory vaccines, other vaccines based on case accrual happened to us here. I think we believe we're getting better at predicting where that epidemiology will be, where we cite the trials and ultimately being able to accrue cases that are matched to the vaccine composition.

And I think we are hopeful that with this additional second season, which was always a possibility, that we'll be able to show -- accrue enough cases to conduct that IA and ultimately demonstrate the efficacy of the vaccine. The impact on commercial target product profile moving forward, I would say, we don't believe that there's been a change to that. At the end of the day, what matters here is hopefully a highly effective vaccine against preventing norovirus.

It is a well-established burden of disease globally, and we do believe that the health economic benefit of prevention of severe to moderate infections with norovirus will be clear, particularly those that are at highest risk, including those that live in long-term care facilities or other for other occupational reasons might be at risk. So we still feel strongly about that target product profile and think that the epidemiology challenges of the last season will be addressable with the second season of enrollment.

Our next question comes from Luca Issi with RBC.

Luca Issi
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Great. Congrats on the progress. Maybe, Jamey, can you just talk about what gives you confidence that you can reiterate your cash breakeven guide for 2028? I appreciate you're making some fantastic progress in terms of like managing the OpEx and the CapEx, but still your cash cost at the midpoint this year is $4.6 billion. So I think in order to breakeven in 2028, you really need your top line to reinflect quite materially from here. So can you just talk about that?

I mean it looks like COVID is still declining. RSV, maybe it's one and done for now. CMV did not make it. INP initially is going to be just for adjuvant melanoma. So what are the near-term products that you think can really inflect the top line in the foreseeable future? And then maybe second, Stephane, quickly, I think a few media outlets have reported that Moderna is working on potential large deals with pharma. So wondering if you can comment on that. And then maybe bigger picture, what's your latest thinking on DD these days?

James Mock
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Luca. There's a lot in there. And we recognize it's on everybody's mind, and we're going to lay this out at Analyst Day, just so you know. But I'll mention a couple of things here. When we say and we all commit to breaking even, it is both a mix, to your point, of revenue growth and cost reduction. And so on the cost reduction side, as I mentioned earlier to Salveen's question, we see ample opportunity. And I mentioned that we will update our 2026 and 2027 framework at Analyst Day, but there's still plenty to do on that front.

On the revenue side, we have -- we see a lot through geographic expansion through our strategic partnerships that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, through new product introductions. We'll get -- we'll lay that out in a more fulsome way at Analyst Day, but we remain committed. But yes, it is a mix of both the revenue side growing as well as the cost side reducing, and we still feel confident in our plan.

Stéphane Bancel
CEO & Director

Thank you, Jamey. And on the deal side, as we spoke about in several of our last calls, we really want to get products like the latent vaccine like EBV, for example, to patients. As we've said, part of our prioritization of our portfolio, we'd not want to fund a Phase III by ourselves. And so we are talking to pharma companies. We are talking to financial sponsors. As you know, we have a partnership with Blackstone that we did on flu, mRNA-1010. So those discussions are ongoing. And when we have something to communicate, we will.

Your next question comes from Tyler Van Buren with TD Cowen.

Gregory Wiessner
TD Cowen, Research Division

This is Greg on for Tyler. It looks like mNEXSPIKE is already taking the slight majority of your COVID vaccinations over Spikevax. So how do you expect the split between these 2 vaccines to continue to evolve? And I'd also be interested to hear what feedback you're hearing from pharmacists and other clinicians about mNEXSPIKE so far?

Stephen Hoge
President

Thanks for the questions. So we're obviously really pleased with that launch. It has become our leading product in the overall COVID franchise. And that's been, frankly, exceeded our expectations in a positive way. It really speaks to the profile, we think the clinical data as well as the overall sort of momentum in the market towards higher-risk populations. Some of that as a result of changes in recommendation in this country toward -- in the United States towards higher-risk individuals and those over the age of 65.

We're continuing to build out that medical story, and the data has been shared, obviously at ECIP, but in medical meetings. And we hope to continue to build momentum behind the mNEXSPIKE brand as our leading product in the franchise. Now Spikevax will always have a place. And as you know, Spikevax is the only approved product in pediatrics down to 6 months to 4-year-olds. And that is an important population, particularly for those with high-risk factors, those with lung disease or those with underlying comorbidities even in the young population.

So we will always expect some portion to be at Spikevax. But over time, we would hope that the older adults and higher-risk populations might migrate to mNEXSPIKE. That's consistent with the feedback we've been getting. And in fact, if you look at many of our large customers, both health systems and pharmacies, that is how they are thinking about the products and using them.

We'll be working with governments around the world as we move to not launch mNEXSPIKE -- sorry, as we move to launch mNEXSPIKE outside of the U.S. for the next season, and we hope to continue to see growth in that brand as a part of our overall franchise. But as I said, we will always have both. I don't have specific guidance on the split because at the end of the day, this is a decision made by health care providers and customers about what's the most appropriate choice for their patients.

Our next question comes from Jessica Fye with JPMorgan.

Unknown Analyst

This is [indiscernible] for Jessica. How is the U.S. COVID vaccine demand tracking this season relative to your projections? And what about the ex U.S. season? And also, can you orient us around the potential annual revenue contribution tied to the manufacturing sites in the U.K., Canada and Australia?

James Mock
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So yes, I'll break it down the U.S., OUS and then the manufacturing contribution. So it's track -- I think I mentioned this a little bit already. So our revised guidance is $1 billion to $1.3 billion in the U.S. We anticipate that vaccination rates are going to be in the range of down 20% to down 40%. That's not too different than what we thought at the outset of the year that it could be flat to down. We definitely incorporated a scenario where vaccination rates could be down. But we feel good about it.

We are mostly -- we're halfway through the season and feel good about and have confidence in our U.S. range. Outside the United States, we actually raised the bottom end of our revenue guidance. So we used to be $0.5 billion to $700 million. Now it's $600 million to $700 million. That's due to everything is now contracted. A lot of it has been delivered. And as we look to the last couple of months of this year, what's really coming down to the only variables left are delivery timing, whether some of this falls into the first quarter of 2026 or remains in 4Q '25.

And then there are a couple of markets that are predicated upon vaccination rates. So the demand is still tied to vaccination rates. So we feel very comfortable with our range outside the United States as well. Then in terms of the strategic partnerships, if you remember, in, I think, the second quarter, we said that the deliveries for our U.K. strategic partnership has already shifted outside the year, which was the reason we dropped the high end from $2.5 billion at that time to $2.2 billion.

So we do not expect any revenue inside this year. That will be pure growth in the year 2026. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that half of our international revenue was in Canada in the third quarter. So Canada is up and running. We believe Australia will be up and running from a revenue perspective, that is in the fourth quarter and then the U.K. in the first quarter of next year. So we feel good heading into next year that we should be able to see some revenue growth from our strategic partnerships.

Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Citigroup.

Geoffrey Meacham

I have 2 for you. So the first one on the cost reduction and just looking at the 2028 breakeven target. I was curious if your pipeline evaluation process has evolved just to look at maximizing ROI on your R&D investments. And then on the rare disease platform, what's the capacity in this TA to add more programs? It does seem like it could be quicker to get the proof-of-concept data, but I just maybe wanted to compare that to oncology and how you guys are thinking about it.

Stephen Hoge
President

Thanks for both those questions. So first on R&D, I think it was a couple of years ago and reiterated last year that we said as far as large Phase III programs in our infectious disease pipeline, that we would defer further Phase III investments until we cross breakeven -- cash breakeven in 2028. And that as a result of that, there would be this substantial downshifting in our R&D expenditures over last year and this year and the next year ahead as the large Phase IIIs for flu, for COVID, for CMV and even norovirus run off.

And so we've maintained that position all the way through how we've been constructing our pipeline, which I would say is not necessarily ROI maximizing. It is cash and investment optimizing. We do believe we have several compelling Phase II programs. EBV is one example of a vaccine against infection mononucleosis and perhaps multiple sclerosis, but one that we are not moving forward with in terms of investment. I believe that ROI is attractive and positive, we do, but we will wait to make investments until we've shown we can break even based on the current products.

And so that's the way our portfolio has been evolving from a construction perspective. Now there are instances, for instance, in our oncology space, where we do see an opportunity to make cash investments within our prior guidance, whether that's with the intismeran program or with 4359 that we think are -- have a very attractive ROI and again, can fit within our breakeven guidance for '28. And so those are instances of where we will continue to move forward. And maybe that's a natural segue to that last part of your question, which is that is also true to some extent in the rare disease space.

We have the 2 programs, PA and MMA that are moving towards or in the case of PA fully enrolled in their potential registrational studies. And it is a platform where we do believe we can do much more. There is a very large number of diseases for which we think the technology can work. But again, we want to demonstrate discipline. And so we are not prioritizing making further investments in the rare disease space until we have PA and MMA through those registrational studies and ideally until we also achieve our breakeven targets for '28.

It is a lower cash investment to move those programs forward. And so as you alluded to, it might be a place that naturally as we get more comfortable over the next year or 2 that we start moving perhaps a third or a fourth program through. But that will have to be balanced against further investments in oncology like the 4359 programs or potentially the reinitiation of pivotal investments in our infectious disease portfolio. And at this point, we'll make those decisions in the future and haven't got a strategic view one way or the other right now.

Our next question comes from Courtney Breen with Bernstein.

Courtney Breen
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Just wanted to probe a little bit more on the R&D cuts, perhaps kind of in contrast to Salveen's question, perhaps a little bit more forward-looking. As you think about kind of the efficiencies that you've garnered and the new approach, are there more cuts that you can make going forward to that R&D plan? Or would that require actually stopping of programs or changing kind of your prioritized list of assets that you have in the pipe?

Stephen Hoge
President

Yes. Thank you for the question. So we do expect further reductions in costs. We've previously communicated how we were moving towards breakeven. And so today's cash costs for 2025, while they are better than our guidance, they are not done. And we expect further reductions in our GAAP cost for R&D over the coming year and 2, purely based on the sunsetting of our existing prioritized investments.

And so we believe that those reductions will happen without further program stops and we will continue to do investment in the early-stage space as well, which, as you know, is a less cash-intensive, capital-intensive area. So at this point, we believe we can continue to drive efficiencies and further cost reductions in our R&D investment in the coming years simply by completing the work that we had started several years ago in our infectious disease vaccines portfolio.

Our next question comes from Myles Minter with William Blair.

John Boyle
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

This is John on for Myles. So maybe a follow-up to an earlier question on the CMV program. I know that you're still going through the data, but I was wondering if you could speak to any read-through from the CMV trial missing to any of your other latent vaccine studies or if you view the CMV miss as an isolated event?

Stephen Hoge
President

Thanks for the question. So CMV was unique in our pipeline in that it is the only pivotal study, a Phase III study that we are running against a latent virus and the only one that was going after prevention of infection. So we do believe that prevention of infection was unfortunately the only way to try and demonstrate a potential for the vaccine against congenital CMV, but it was by far the highest bar. Vaccines generally don't prevent infection. They prevent diseases from the viruses.

And even in the case of CMV, we still believe that there's an opportunity for mRNA-1647 to have an impact in patients undergoing bone marrow transplant where they are already infected, but they see a reactivation of their CMV that can have serious potential morbidity and mortality. And for that reason, we think there's an opportunity for a vaccine to help control that reactivation, even a vaccine against CMV.

So I guess I would say we don't have other programs in our late-stage or prioritized pipeline that have a similar read-through or read-through from the CMV results because we are not trying to prevent infection with any of them. We're trying to prevent diseases. And even in the case of CMV, we see a potential opportunity in an indication like bone marrow transplant CMV reactivation, where, again, the target product profile is going against prevention of a disease, not prevention of infection.
