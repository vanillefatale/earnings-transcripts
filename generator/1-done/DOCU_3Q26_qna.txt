[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jake Roberge with William Blair.

Jacob Roberge
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Nice to see the billings strength and continued expectation for that to accelerate this year. As you start to transition to ARR, should we expect that ARR is seeing a fairly similar reacceleration that we're seeing with billings on a full year basis? Or would there be any puts or takes that we should be thinking about around that metric moving forward?

Allan Thygesen
President, CEO & Director

Why don't you take that one, Blake.

Blake Grayson
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. Yes. Thanks for the question, Jake. So we're not disclosing ARR yet. We'll do that when we get to the March call. I think that the way to think about it for us is what our trajectory is, as you heard us talk about billings growth, excluding from the early's component as well, and that's a good proxy for trajectory for our business. But I think for us, we're really excited about the opportunity with both the combination of expansion opportunities with IAM, but then also with gross retention improvements in our core business as well to really drive that ARR number forward for us into FY '27 and into beyond it. But we'll talk more about that when we get to March.

Allan Thygesen
President, CEO & Director

Go ahead. No, I was just going to say that I want to emphasize that we're running the business on ARR now. And so we wanted to move to a place where we're sharing with you how we run the business. And so that's the spirit which you should take this. I think it's the right long-term metric for the company, and we look forward to sharing that with you as we go forward.

Jacob Roberge
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

That's helpful. And then great to see IAM crossing that 25,000 customer mark. Could you talk more about what you're seeing with the early renewal cohorts? It sounds like retention has been strong. But for customers that may have initially started with only a portion of their base on IAM, are you starting to see those customers shift to broader and wider IAM deployments on renewal?

Allan Thygesen
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Overall, I think we're pleased with the early signs. As a reminder, we launched IAM back in June of last year to commercial customers in North America and Australia. And so that -- those are the cohorts that are renewing now, and then we launched internationally in enterprise towards the latter end of the year -- part of last year.

The early signs are very promising. They renew at higher rates than our traditional signed business. So yes, we obviously we'll keep a close eye on that. And in terms of the expansion, I don't have anything beyond that to say, but as we -- you'll see that baked into our projections going forward on ARR.

Obviously, we're optimistic that IAM will progress very nicely in companies over time. The smaller companies don't have as much expansion opportunity. When you get to larger companies, you're deployed in individual department or division, then those expansion opportunities are larger. But overall, I think we feel really good both about the initial sale and about the adoption and the follow-on.

Our next question comes from Tyler Radke with Citi.

Tyler Radke
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Yes. Obviously, great momentum on the IAM side, 25,000 customers. The Navigator product, in particular, great to see the volume of agreements there. I guess a bigger picture question for you, Allan, like how do you think about what the use cases and future monetization opportunity is? Is that volume of agreements continue to grow within Navigator? Like what -- how are customers going to be using it a year or 2 from now? And what are the ways that DocuSign can monetize over the long run?

Allan Thygesen
President, CEO & Director

Yes. A couple of points I'd say. First of all, Navigator is sort of a foundational capability for our IAM platform, right? And so many things roll off of having that intelligent repository. As an example, you can run things like obligation management and a variety of extractions on top of that. You can have automated notification. The agents can run off that. And so it really is a foundational capability that's embedded in the platform. It's not like we monetize Navigator separately, it's an integral part of IAM.

We're feeling, I think, that, that is a significant and distinctive proprietary advantage for DocuSign. So there's a lot of noise in the ecosystem about LLM models. And we obviously have benefited tremendously from the enormous CapEx investment and capability enhancement that's happened in the LLM space over the last 2.5 years and very grateful to be leading DocuSign through that.

But on top of that, we get to train on proprietary consented private agreements from companies that are not publicly available. And so we can achieve higher accuracy rates with that. So you take that, compounded with our workflow advantage and our trust and reputation advantages, I think it all sets up really nicely for us, and Navigator is foundational to that. But we don't -- we monetize it as part of the platform, not independently, if that makes sense.

Tyler Radke
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Yes. That's helpful. And a follow-up for Blake. Good to see the billings upside this quarter, and I think trailing 12-month billings accelerated. As we look at the subscription revenue guide for Q4, the growth is a little bit below where you guided Q3. And I guess just given that you're going to be transitioning to ARR next quarter, how would you sort of characterize the underlying growth of the business? Has it been steady? Is it accelerating? Maybe you're just adding in a bit more prudence in Q4 because of macro go-to-market changes? Just help us understand kind of the puts and takes on that.

Blake Grayson
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. Yes. So our revenue, we're obviously guiding to a Q4 revenue growth rate, which is a bit of a decel from Q3. Two primary things that are driving that and neither of them, I think, are that worrisome, which is, one is Q3, we do have some extra early's component hit us in Q3 in a good way, and you get a little bit of revenue acceleration from that.

And then the other thing to remember is if you go back to Q4 of last year, we grew revenue at a pretty big clip. We grew revenue Q4 of '25 at 9%. And if you recall, there was a -- we launched a number of new features, especially on the PLG side in digital for, call it, shorter-term envelope add-ons and things like that, which we got that boost because from Q3 to Q4 last year, our revenue accelerated by over 100 basis points. And so I would just encourage you to make sure to look at that hard comp that we have on a year-over-year basis because that does explain a bit of it when you think about a decel like that from Q3 to Q4.

Our next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.

Mark Murphy
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats on a very nice performance. You had mentioned, I believe, consistent growth in envelope sent and -- but you called out utilization rates reaching multiyear highs. And I'm just wondering if there's any way to help us conceptualize that. For instance, are the envelope sent growing mid-single digits? Are they growing high single digits? And then -- or any sense of where the utilization rates stand?

And as part of that, should we read into this that customers are basically using more of what they paid for. And so it's going to foreshadow pretty healthy upsell and expansion ARR opportunity in future periods? Or is there some other kind of takeaway from that?

Blake Grayson
Executive VP & CFO

Let me take a stab, and Allan jump in. So yes, we don't break out like the envelope sent growth by vertical such that. But what I would say is it's been very, very consistent for us, and I'll talk about envelopes first and then we can talk about utilization after that. On the envelope sent, the past 5 quarters or so, we have seen very consistent growth year-over-year in envelope sent, which is great. It goes to the point that where you've seen what makes me so excited about the resiliency of this business.

On the utilization side, so like consumption, it is higher than our prior year. And I think for us, it's a factor of timing, right? So if somebody is using -- and I'm making these numbers up, so -- but if they're using 80% of their deal and it rises to 85%, that's always a good sign for us. Now the timing of the billing opportunity and the new contract for them is subject to their business situation and their needs and all things like that. But I think all in for us as a company, as those utilization rates grow, I think they're only positive signs for us. And so I'm really excited about it, but the timing of it is always subject to each individual customer situation.

Allan Thygesen
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And I would just add, historically, that's obviously been a key performance metric for our signed business, and we continue to keep a very close eye on it. Sellers certainly track it. But we now have a much broader portfolio of stuff to follow up on. So as we build that momentum with more envelope volume utilization, we don't just go back to them and say, "Hey, would you like some more envelopes?" We go to them and say, "Would you like to deploy in new agreement workflows? Would you like to consider this in other parts of the business? Would you like to learn what's in all your agreements and make that information conveniently available in the apps that you care about?" And that's just a much broader proposition and opportunity for upsell than we've historically had.

Mark Murphy
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, I think you mentioned that the AI contract agents are in beta. Are you able to give any kind of sneak peek of what you're engineering there? What kind of usage scenarios you're imagining? I think we're trying to figure out if you're going to target procurement or sales workloads or take it broader and then would they review contracts or generate clauses? Or is there some other kind of automation that you're going to do? And if you're not able to speak to that now, I think we understand that as well, but I thought I'd ask anyway.

Allan Thygesen
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Well, I mean, we're launching several. They tend to be, shall we say, relatively simple workflows, as you would expect. You don't necessarily want to try to automate the most complex, highest variability workflows. They exist across sales and HR and procurement use cases, so much like our IAM platform and Signature platform do.

So we're -- I think that's probably as much as I should say at this time, but it's early days, right? We are just putting it out there. I think for all the noise, I think we're still in very early days of enterprise evaluations of these things. But we think it's inevitable that a number of contractual workflows will ultimately be automated with agents, and we want to be at the forefront of that. And so that's why you're seeing us lean in.

In the same vein, that's, of course, also why we are leaning in with a number of the chat platforms that would often be triggers for agentic action and why they're so keen to partner with us. So we announced a partnership with an integration with OpenAI at our developer conference at the end of last month.

And basically, everybody else that matters in the space since then has reached out to us because agreements are an essential data site that touches so many different workflows inside of companies and DocuSign is incredibly well positioned to provide that data to help with the automation agenda that many companies have. So look, it's early days, but we are very excited about becoming a system of action for agreements.

Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.

Peter Burkly
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Yes. This is Peter Burkly on for Kirk. Strong quarter in the large customer segment, that $300,000-plus ACV customer group, I think it was the strongest growth in 8 or 10 quarters. Just curious if you could discuss how much of that's being driven by IAM adoption at the enterprise level versus just more broadly a stronger go-to-motion at this point in time versus maybe a year ago?

Allan Thygesen
President, CEO & Director

Yes, it's both. So we continue to see strength with customers who are just expanding their eSignature usage. And at the same time, we're now starting to see some nice enterprise wins with IAM and both contribute nicely to the momentum in the $300,000 segment.

Peter Burkly
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up on IAM. IAM has been in the enterprise market for a few quarters now. Just curious if there's any learnings or any thoughts on the go-to-market playbook as you head into fiscal '27?

Allan Thygesen
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Look, it's still early days. I want to emphasize that, it's a multiyear journey for us or indeed any company undertaking this transformation. We've made some really nice early wins, and it's nice to be able to see that continued progression. So we've got significant work going on, on the innovation side in terms of scaling our enterprise feature set and access control extensibility. And on the go-to-market side, as you asked, key focus areas for next year include sort of complementing our traditional land and expand motion across departments with more of a top-down platform executive upsell, and we do that, but I think we can get better.

We want to lean into both our ISV partnerships where we're already starting to see some nice progress and perhaps even more importantly, our system integrator partnerships. Historically, for DocuSign, that's been predominantly a CLM activity, but now it's literally the whole company has leaned in, and we're seeing a lot of inbound interest from the SI partners in partnering with us because we have such a unique and broad proposition.

And then lastly, on the pricing and packaging side, we've gotten questions on past calls. You'll not be surprised to learn that as we move up from a lower friction model in the commercial space where simplicity is key to the enterprise. We are testing a more of a platform pricing model with tokens. It's being very well received. And so I think you should expect to see us move in that direction more publicly. And that gives us just a lot more flexibility as we continue to layer in new capability and new value into IAM.

Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies.

Brent Thill
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Allan, I know your long-term aspiration is double-digit growth. You're obviously knocking on the door. But what do you think it needs to take from here for you to continue to sustain or get to double-digit growth from your side? Are there a couple of ingredients that you think still have to trigger before you can hit that mark?

Allan Thygesen
President, CEO & Director

We are making really good progress, and I'm proud of the team. I think we -- look, the 2 big levers are what you would expect. It's retention, and we, I think, continue to make progress on that. I think there's still more headroom for us there, and it's new expansion bookings. And I think we are making progress there, particularly driven by IAM. And I'm pretty confident those 2 levers will get us there. So we're working on it.

Brent Thill
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. Blake, good to see the record buyback, I guess, may play devil's advocate in the age of AI, why not lean a little harder into M&A? And is there anything you need to do to kind of help Allan's vision of that double-digit growth even if it's inorganic?

Blake Grayson
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Absolutely. It's something we talk about actively at DocuSign. It's a subject that on the outside, it may not sound like because we don't do an acquisition every quarter. But for us, it's something we talk about actively. We're looking for those companies and those assets that can help propel us forward, whether that's through elements of retention or expansion, right, for us.

And I think that, again, we're super active about it. It is one of the reasons why we do keep the optionality on our balance sheet, right, for those opportunities as they present themselves to us, we look at a lot. We have a high bar for those acquisition conversations. But it is something that Allan and I and the team, I would say, actively talk about probably more than people think.

Allan Thygesen
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Maybe just to add to that, first of all, I feel very good about our organic growth trajectory and the innovation, the scale and scope of the innovation that the teams are driving. So I think there's enough there. With that said, we have the resources, we have the go-to-market model. I think we want to explore strategically places where we think we can be additive. The Lexion acquisition has been fantastic for DocuSign. It augmented our product road map, both from a workflow and AI perspective. In fact, the Agreement Desk product that we just launched this week was inspired by an earlier Lexion product and was led by the Lexion founders. And so it's very -- that's been a fantastic deal in every way, product, technology, team, and we inherited a good number of customers that have also performed very well. So overall, that was just excellent. If we can find more like that, we will, and we're looking. As you may know, it's -- there are things that are a little frothy right now.

Brent Thill
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I guess the message is that you just keep leaning in the buyback until you find something you like and then you can balance and so you can do both.

Blake Grayson
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean we take capital allocation here really seriously, which is when we generate excess capital, we have opportunities to redeploy that. For right now, the buyback, we think, is a great opportunity to do that with the kind of the forward-looking outcomes that we think we can go after. At the same point in time, if we find those opportunities to deploy that capital to an M&A opportunity that helps do that for us as well, we'll absolutely consider it. So capital allocation for us is a topic that Allan and I talk about quite often.

Operator

Our next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham.

Scott Berg
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Nice quarter. Just one question for me, and I don't know maybe this is a question for Allan is on the AI contract agents. Super interesting. I think legal contracts is one of the best use cases for these LLM technologies for all the probably inherent reasons we all know here on the call.

But as we think about your customers and where they are and, I guess, awareness for agents, and I'm sure it's new to them and how we think about maybe budget procurement. Is this something that you think can have a meaningful impact to some of your momentum in fiscal '27? Or is this more of a maybe a fiscal '28 opportunity as they test and trial next year and probably try to get some budgets after that?

Allan Thygesen
President, CEO & Director

I don't think it's a huge contributor to our financial momentum next year. But enterprise software is a multiyear road map endeavor and people want to know there with somebody who can deliver for them not just now but years to come. And so it's very important to provide visibility to what they can do when they are ready. And I've no doubt we'll have a number of trials, but I don't think it will be financially meaningful, but it's certainly strategic.

Operator

Our next question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America.

Bradley Sills
BofA Securities, Research Division

Maybe a go-to-market question with regards to IAM. Allan, you talked about how you're seeing progress with HR and procurement departments. Is that the primary land in the departmental sale in those 2 legal? I'm just curious if the sales audience and the large enterprise really kind of centers around those 3 departments. And curious how well prepared you feel the go-to-market is to address those?

Allan Thygesen
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I would change the statement a little bit. I would say the 4 main use cases for us: sales, procurement, HR and customer experience, we should think of that as sort of business-to-consumer type flows, banking onboarding, that kind of stuff. And we're seeing demand across all of those. I would say from a maturity perspective, we've had a very strong position for a long time and I would say, sales and customer experience type applications. But there is a lot of interest now in procurement and in HR.

On the procurement side, these tend to be high dollar, low headcount, complex, poorly supported. And I think they're so eager to find solutions to achieve more efficiency in procurement processes and unlock value that's in agreements they've already negotiated.

And on the HR side, that's, of course, essentially those are business-to-consumer flows just on the hiring side as opposed to the selling side. And those are quite poorly integrated categories. And so a lot of the HR departments are very eager to see those processes streamlined. And we have a number of ISV partnerships that we've announced here even this quarter, something with Dayforce. We've done stuff with smart recruiters. We've done stuff with a lot of folks in the HR space that integrate DocuSign in to make the entire, let's say, candidate onboarding process, for example, more efficient.

So those are the 4 big ones that you'll see us talking about, and you'll see us highlight at our conference in the spring. So one way, maybe to take a step back and think about the ongoing maturing of IAM. When we first launched, we launched with a set of horizontal platform capabilities, right, Navigator being the most obvious example is the intelligent repository. This year, we sort of completed that suite of agreement-related workflows with things like Agreement Desk.

And next year, where we're going is fully integrated end-to-end functional workflow suites that are polished and integrated with all the pieces, and it will be those 4. And so you can look forward to that. We're obviously already packaging that to some extent, but it will -- that will get tighter and better. And I think that's really -- those are the use cases that will -- the departments and use cases that will power the IAM growth.

Bradley Sills
BofA Securities, Research Division

That's great. That's great. And maybe, Blake, one for you, if I could, please. Any observations on the macro? Any changes to the backdrop, whether it's regards to envelope volumes or signings? There's some moving parts in the SMB right now. So just curious if you've seen any difference there between SMB, commercial and enterprise your envelope and signing activity?

Blake Grayson
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. I would say there's nothing material that we've seen in the business in Q3, and that's been pretty consistent for us over the past, gosh, 4 or 5 quarters, I would say. I mean consumption usage trends are consistent for us. We're seeing pretty strong year-over-year growth across most verticals.

Now that said, companies are still scrutinizing spend and people sitting in my position at various companies want to make sure they're getting the most value they can for things. But that's, I think, one of the big benefits of this -- the breadth of our customer base that we have is that just the consistent resiliency that we've seen is something that I've been really excited about, and we'll see how the macro evolves over time. But to date, nothing really of any angst or concern out there that we've seen to date.

Our next question comes from Josh Baer with Morgan Stanley.

Lucas Cerisola
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

This is Lucas Cerisola on for Josh Baer. Congrats on a great quarter. Could you give us some more color on the 25,000 IAM customers, specifically how many are new to DocuSign versus existing eSign customers?

Allan Thygesen
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Yes. So it's over 25,000 across our direct to digital business. It's predominantly direct, and they are -- the vast majority of them are existing eSign customers that upgrade to IAM. But we do onboard quite a few new customers directly on to IAM as well. But the vast majority is the installed base. And of course, that's the incredible advantage that we have. We have now almost 1.8 million customers that pay us monthly.

Let's take the -- if we just look at the direct customer base, I think we're in the 270,000-or-so active customers that are serviced by our sales teams. We are -- we have so much headroom and yet come in with this huge advantage that we are already an approved vendor generally well liked and trusted, often have many of their agreements. And so the step up to engage with us on IAM is just far less than if we were a new vendor. So a lot of headroom left, but definitely driven predominantly by the installed base in part because, frankly, most companies are already our customers.

Lucas Cerisola
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. That's super helpful. And one more. Could you talk about hiring expectations for the year ahead? What should headcount growth look like? And what areas are you investing in aside from IAM and then within IAM?

Allan Thygesen
President, CEO & Director

Yes, I'll go and Blake, you should jump in as well. Yes, look, we project quite modest headcount growth. We want to -- while we are very bullish on our growth opportunity, we also feel like we -- look, we've got a lot of hard-fought efficiency gains in the company, and we want to hold on to those. Now you may see some reallocation within the company. There are areas, including product and security, where I think we want to continue investing disproportionately. But I don't anticipate our overall headcount to grow significantly. We're just being judicious, investing carefully in the places that we think give us the most leverage over time. Blake, I don't know...

Blake Grayson
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I'd just say we're quite thoughtful about it. I think we've added over the past year, just over 200 net kind of headcount to DocuSign. So we're hiring across all of our locations. Vast majority of those folks, we tend to add a little bit more in our lower-cost locations as well. So like Allan said, we're trying to be very methodical and very thoughtful about our hiring needs to make sure that we can support this business. But also we made a lot of hard choices to get to the efficiency gains that we've done over the past few years, and we're not just going to give those up either. And so I think that it's that balanced view that I think is the right path for us.

Operator

Our next question comes from Patrick Walravens with Citizens.

Austin Cole
Citizens JMP Securities, LLC, Research Division

This is Austin Cole on for Pat. Allan, you called out one of the DocuSign's top 10 customers becoming second largest customer this quarter through IAM. I just wanted to give the opportunity if there's anything to call out on that, expansion sounded pretty significant. What do they see in IAM? And is it kind of Navigator where they're getting most of the unlock or anything else there that would be helpful.

Allan Thygesen
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Yes, it is Navigator, but it's Navigator Plus. We -- they are powering a lot of their pre-signature workflows with our milestone agreement type capabilities. And that -- by the way, I think that is a more and more robust part of the offering. I mentioned Agreement Desk, we launched Agreement Prep, which is a whole system for creating templates and standard agreements that you can then deploy, which, of course, is a very common use case in, let's say, a B2B sales context, for example, a vendor management context.

And so I'm feeling very bullish about the opportunity for expansion from our eSign base into -- and there are so many paths we can take with IAM. And that was just a great win. But there's a number of them. And I think some customers really go wall to wall. I mean we mentioned ServiceTitan, I think, on the last call, and they're deploying us across a very broad set of functions. And of course, we love that. Ultimately, we love to be deployed across every function. I think that's our ultimate destiny as we fulfill our platform strategy.

Operator

Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.

Aleksandr Zukin
Wolfe Research, LLC

Maybe just 2 quick ones. If we think about the early renewal dynamic that you saw impact billings this quarter, kind of how much of that do you feel like was -- like how much of IAM included in those early renewal conversations around the upsell dynamics specifically? And is that now kind of shifting more towards the installed base picking up that SKU rather than just new customers? And I have a quick follow-up.

Blake Grayson
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. Let me take a stab at it. So the vast majority of our early renewals is still our core business and our core product. We've got a very large book of business that renews. Now IAM does play a role in some of those early renewals. And overall, what I really care about the most is that we're -- on those early renewals that we're spending the time with the folks that are expanding. Now expansion can come from IAM, obviously, but also can come from eSign, and we see that. And so I'm super excited about just the definition of expansion in general. Now of course, I think that there's a lot of value that can come from IAM, and I think the customers over time are going to see that value and want to adopt it over time as well.

But -- and then also from an IAM perspective, and Allan mentioned this earlier, our installed base is our primary target, right, for this. Like we're signing up new customers, no doubt, right, for IAM, but we have relationships with customers. They understand DocuSign. They trust DocuSign. They have their agreements with DocuSign. So it creates that opportunity for us, I think, that is a huge advantage for us that we can try to take leverage to be able to grow that business.

Aleksandr Zukin
Wolfe Research, LLC

Perfect. And then maybe, I guess, Blake, just for you a follow-up. And this is a little bit more nuanced on the billings. But if I look at the delta between the implied Q4 billings guide, from kind of last quarter to this quarter. It looks like it went up from 7.5% to the new to 8%. So that 0.5 point, how much of that raise is truly operational outperformance versus kind of core FX and maybe other onetime non-core factors?

And how should we think about the underlying kind of run rate billings growth, excluding early renewal timing or duration in FX for Q4?

Blake Grayson
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So relative to the full year guide, I think we raised the full year guide on billings by about $44 million. So that's about $5 million more than the outperformance we had versus the midpoint in Q3. So we've taken some of that operational performance and flowed it through into Q4 and raised it off of what you're calling the implied subtracting fiscal -- the full year versus Q3 from our last quarter. So we are seeing improvements in the core side of the business.

I think to your point about trying to manage around, okay, what is that underlying growth rate of billings, excluding early renewals and such is one of the reasons we're making these adjustments in FY '27 that we're talking about. I think one of the ways to think about it is if you look at Q3, like we just said, about a 10% growth in billings, more like 8%, excluding that early renewal component outperformance. So I think that's the nature of it. I mean in billings, early renewals will always be a part of our billings number. They will always represent a percentage of our billings.

The question for us or as a team is what we think about and what is the health of the business is are we expanding those early renewals. And there's cases sometimes where you might do a flat one, but you want to make sure that you're spending your time in quarter for us on those. If you're going to do with early, it's like, wow, this customer needs, they have more demand. They're seeking that demand. How can we help them? Should we consider them for an IAM upgrade and we have those discussions. But hopefully, that just helps level set it. But again, timing of early renewals, it can be very volatile, and we've seen that, and it happens every single quarter. So to try to get into that impact on a Q4 basis in a guide gets a little trickier. So hopefully, that Q3 description gives you some of the directional kind of look that I think you're looking for.

This now concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Allan for closing comments.

Allan Thygesen
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, operator. Thank you to all who joined today's call. So in closing, I want to thank the entire DocuSign team for their commitment to putting our customers first and delivering on demand for better solutions to the agreement management problem. DocuSign's business is both resilient and at the leading edge of AI development, and we'll continue to manage the company to realize our long-term potential.

Thanks for your time, and we look forward to engaging with you next quarter.
