Question-and-Answer Session

Vipul Garg
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

[Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Aditya Suresh of Macquarie.

Aditya Suresh
Macquarie Research

So two questions. The first is on the stand-alone hotels segment. There's [clearly] been a very strong acceleration in kind of your number of hotel room nights booked. Could you further break down that by maybe the premium segment, the budget segment and also international in terms of the growth you're seeing there? And then in relation to that is, are there any changes to the underlying take rate you've seen as this mix is changing?

Mohit Kabra
Senior Vice President of Finance, Administration & Legal and Additional Director

Aditya, maybe I can take that. Like I just called out, the whole GST rationalization, which had kind of come in end of September was expected to kind of be a fillip for growth in the hotel segment, and we have actually seen this coming through. So while our overall stand-alone hotel room nights have grown at about 20.6%, the room night growth in the non-premium segment, which is the budget to kind of mid-pricing, that has been much stronger at about 23% year-on-year. So we clearly saw that benefit coming through. In terms of overall margins, I think our margins have largely stayed in line at about 17.7%. So there's no real kind of significant change in the margin structure per se. And like we've been calling out, we want to kind of keep the margins in the kind of teens category, the high teens category, and we are kind of pretty comfortable in having a stable regime on the margin side.

Aditya Suresh
Macquarie Research

And then the second piece is on ancillary services. And here, you're seeing a really strong revenue growth. Is it at all possible for you to quantify the underlying margin you're seeing here? Because I assume that a lot of this is just [indiscernible] to EBITDA or EBIT. Can you just talk through and give us any color on kind of the underlying margin for the growth you're seeing in ancillary services?

Mohit Kabra
Senior Vice President of Finance, Administration & Legal and Additional Director

Sure. I mean, actually the growth in the other segment or ancillaries has been a continuing trend, if you look at it over the last few years. And this is also coming in from the fact that we have been adding a lot of new services on the platform, right, over the last few years. And over a period of time, each one of them is scaling up well. So just to give you an example, a couple of years back, two years back, we had added the intercity cab segment. We have dialed up the airport transfers. We have started dialing up rail ticketing, particularly for the high-speed air-conditioned trains. There also, our market share has kind of now gone up closer to about 4%, 5%. So -- and apart from this, we've also been adding a lot of nontravel or the non-transport kind of ancillaries, whether it is byte-size insurance, whether it is forex, whether it is kind of sponsorships and ad tech on the platform.

Visa services is something that Rajesh had called out. So all of these put together, we believe and this year, we had also kind of added a new segment of tours and activities. Now again, this is something which is very interesting because, guess what, a lot of these customers, travel customers book their core travel bookings with us, but there is a requirement of in-destination services as well, largely on tours and activities. And building that on the platform helps us kind of retain them even for these services with us. So with this increasing kind of spread of other travel or travel-related services, which we are going on adding, we do believe that the other segment will keep kind of delivering good growth for us.

And at some point in time, maybe 5, 7 years down the line, some of these segments could kind of become meaningful to be reported on their own basis. But yes, there are some segments which are more transport related and there, the margins are largely in line with the industry. And for some of the others, there is a significant fall down to the profitability. So like I said, when we look at profitability, we largely look at it at a platform level. And therefore, we'll largely report kind of margins at a segment level, but report expenses and profitability at a platform level.

Vipul Garg
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

The next question is from the line of Sachin Salgaonkar of Bank of America.

Sachin Salgaonkar
BofA Securities, Research Division

I have three questions. First question, a follow-up to Aditya's question. Mohit, when we look at a Y-o-Y growth in hotel business, it was 17% last quarter; it's now 9%, which has gone below 10% this quarter. Understand the impact of GST, also understand the impact of rupee depreciation, but how to think about it? Is there some kind of a one-off out here? How should one think about a normalized growth from this business? This business was growing at 20-odd percent plus in previous quarters. So should we see the growth resuming back to that number? Should I say all the three questions? Or should I take one back?

Mohit Kabra
Senior Vice President of Finance, Administration & Legal and Additional Director

Let me just kind of explain this a little better because there's something which kind of is more like a one-off starting in this particular quarter onwards, right, because the GST rationalization almost happened at the end of the previous quarter and important to kind of explain this. At a very high level, if you really look at it, we have reported more than 20% growth in the -- on the volume side. Now if you look at the price segment, which is below INR 7,500, there's been a GST reduction of almost 7% and almost 2/3 or 70% plus of our volume is coming from this particular price segment. So roughly about a blended impact of about 5% plus goes through purely on account of the GST-related impact on the gross booking value.

And therefore, like I said, our gross booking growth year-on-year in constant currency has actually come in at about 15.8%. And therefore, if you kind of factor in this additional 5% impact, which came in on the GST side, then our growth actually kind of pretty much remains in line with the volume growth. So I thought I'll just kind of try and share the overall impact coming in with the GST rationalization. Otherwise, there's no real one-off impact. So it's [just] going to be a -- because we had a different GST rate in the previous year, on a year-on-year basis, this looks slightly different.

Rajesh Magow
Co-Founder, Group CEO & Director

Sorry, Sachin, if I may just ask you to clarify. I heard you saying 9% number somewhere. Which number are you referring to?

Sachin Salgaonkar
BofA Securities, Research Division

So Rajesh, I was reporting to the reported hotels and packages revenue, which is $133.2 million. 3Q '24, it was $121.9 million. So it sort of implies a 9% Y-o-Y growth.

Mohit Kabra
Senior Vice President of Finance, Administration & Legal and Additional Director

No, that's true. And therefore, I was just trying to bake in the currency kind of impact as well in calling out the constant currency growth.

Sachin Salgaonkar
BofA Securities, Research Division

So no, I get it, Mohit, now that we end up seeing numbers on a reported currency basis. Going ahead, we should sort of look at a similar kind of a growth, a slight increase from these levels, right?

Mohit Kabra
Senior Vice President of Finance, Administration & Legal and Additional Director

Absolutely. Absolutely, at least for the 4 quarters now, beginning this quarter that we have reported, this GST impact would be there. Constant currency impact would largely be dependent on how the kind of currency kind of plays out in the coming quarters. But the GST impact would largely remain on these lines.

Sachin Salgaonkar
BofA Securities, Research Division

Second question on IndiGo. We all know they've been asked to cut 10% of capacity. Our general checks in the market indicate that till date, other airlines are not able to sort of fully offset that capacity impact. So as we head into calendar '26, how should we look at the domestic air traffic growth for industry? Do we see that normalizing? Or do we still have a bit of an impact out there for full year '26?

Rajesh Magow
Co-Founder, Group CEO & Director

So maybe I can take that, Sachin. This particular disruption was not even factored in. It came from nowhere, to be honest, because these rules were always there, but I don't think anyone anticipated that this would cause this kind of a disruption and therefore, the reduction of supply will happen and largely happened with IndiGo because that's the largest airline in the market. Now our sense is that at least the estimates that we see basis our conversations that while things might have just from a disruption standpoint, stabilized, but in this running quarter, JFM quarter, it should come back to again the positive territory. And I'm talking about daily departures getting back to -- because December, it was negative growth of minus 5% on daily departures on an overall basis. The estimates are now suggesting that it should be back to the positive zone, but albeit at -- either a flat or a 1% or 2% year-on-year positive growth.

And as things progress and more we get out of this particular issue where the rosters settle down, the pilots come on board, et cetera, slowly and gradually, this will continue to keep improving. Outside of this, nothing else changes because the new plane schedules, whichever were coming, the supply coming, that will continue to keep coming. We also learned that even with Air India, the refurbishment of the planes is also happening at an accelerated pace, along with the fact that they also keep -- they're also getting sort of new planes on a regular basis as well. So that is likely to continue.

So I think the overall picture in all fairness will be more clearer, I would say maybe the next seasonal quarter, which is April, May, June quarter, when the summer schedules are filed. And I think we will be in a better position to see overall what kind of supply schedules are being filed, factoring in this temporary issue that happened because of the new rules on flight duty travel for pilots and the new infusion or the refurbish planes that are coming in. So I think we'll have to wait net-net one more quarter, and I've already given you this quarter sort of estimates that the industry is talking about.

Sachin Salgaonkar
BofA Securities, Research Division

And my third question is on Agentic AI and maybe two parts to question. One, would love to understand the feedback on Myra since you guys launched. And second, in a market like U.S., we're actually seeing Google and ChatGPT launch their Agentic AI on travel. Now hopefully, and subsequently, perhaps at some point, it might come into India. So as and when that comes, how should we think from a MakeMyTrip perspective? Is it a new competition for MakeMyTrip where consumers now have an option to go towards these LLMs and book their ticket despite the fact that at the back-end fulfillment perhaps could be done by, let's say, MakeMyTrip only?

Rajesh Magow
Co-Founder, Group CEO & Director

Yes. So let's talk about that. So firstly, progress on Myra, very encouraging, I must say. In fact, some of that I was sort of mentioning that in the script as well, but I'll give you more color. So we -- there are a few metrics that we've been tracking. The first one is how is the interactions, the number of interactions are growing. So from, let's say, a couple of months ago, about 20,000, 25,000 interactions a day, we have now touched about 50,000 transactions -- interactions a day, not transactions a day, but interactions a day on Myra, which is 2x growth in 2 months. And we are sort of seeing pretty much day-on-day, week-on-week growth on that. So clearly, good traction coming up.

And then on the quality metric side, we also measure what we call as good conversation and also the quality score of the interaction. And that is also progressively improving. So we now have a quality score of about 3.9 on a scale of 1 to 5 and about 72% of the conversations are good quality conversations. So it's not like just to give you a sense of what the good quality conversation is that the interaction is sort of happening with more and more back and forth sort of question answers rather than just asking a sort of 30,000 feet level query and then just going off the interface. And that number is about 72%. The other two very important and encouraging metrics that we are tracking.

One is -- and that was one of our hypothesis as well. One is about the new users. So we are seeing out of these 50,000 interactions, about 20% interactions are happening from the new users, never transacted before. And that is largely coming from Tier 3, Tier 4 cities, which is exactly what we were sort of aiming to get where the voice bot is being largely used in vernacular language or the spoken language that consumers prefer coming in from whichever city, whichever state that they are coming from.

So -- and then last but not the least, I would say, which is sort of -- will be a perfect segue to your second part of the question, that the trip planning part because that was another thing that the OTAs had not really been globally focusing on the top end of the funnel, which is the trip planning piece. On Myra, we have seen at least about 23% or 24% of the interactions are related to more trip planning and not necessarily media travel. So all these metrics are pointing towards quite promising, encouraging sort of trends, and we will continue to keep monitoring. And in parallel, obviously, we are working very hard to further improve the product as well. So that journey is also in progress.

Now coming to your point on what Google might have launched in North America and when it comes to India, et cetera, our take is as follows. What is happening is, like I just mentioned earlier, that as far as transactions and fulfillment and the kind of traveler who is willing to -- who's made up his mind or her mind and coming to just book the transaction and get done with it. I don't think that is going to get anyway sort of potentially disrupted. And trip planning was the piece which was not being done by OTAs in any case, right? So then it remains to be seen that if they launch, let's say, their own Gen AI tool for trip planning, whether they will attract more traction. And I think in all probability, there is a possibility that they will attract traction and that the customers from conventional search will move to using AI tools for doing trip planning.

And to my mind, is large part of that is going to be share shift happening from a conventional search to AI tools. But our counter to that, to an extent, will also be our own Gen AI tool for trip planning as well. But the thing to watch out for will be how do we sort of continue to keep protecting our direct traffic, which is -- majority of that is on our app, as you know, that they continue to keep coming to us directly or we end up sort of keep growing that direct traffic as a percentage of the overall traffic. And the share of the paid traffic from any of these sort of new avatars of the search engines we don't end up sort of increasing the share of the paid traffic from that. I don't really see, at least at this point in time, basis our conversation and basis the kind of development that has happened, including the development that is in progress, that there is anyone who is trying to talk about getting to really deep in the funnel and also looking at even the fulfillment, post-sales activities, et cetera, because those are the moats that will continue to stay with the OTAs.

I think trip planning is the only piece where there is definitely potential possibility given the richness of the data that they will have based on the LLMs that they might get more traction. But the counter for that will be our sort of life-to-date customer base and the direct traffic contribution that we already have and how powerful and popular is the brand that MakeMyTrip, Goibibo, and redBus are and are we able to sort of protect that progressively or not. So our sort of energies, investments, resources, et cetera, would be channelized towards that as we continue to watch this space and then accordingly sort of if we need to tweak our strategies as we go along.

We are seeing this as more sort of the overall Gen AI, and I called that out as well, specifically as more opportunity than threat. And I don't think -- and even historically, even in the conventional search sort of space, this debate was always there that whether Google is our competition or Google is the competition for OTAs or not. And I don't think and that debate might still come back. But the reality is that like in the past, I think there are clear distinct moats and the advantages that the OTAs bring to the table. And I think they are a very clear and distinct sort of objective and the business model that the horizontals or the generic search engines have. I'm not sure that even with this evolution of this new technology, there's going to be a significant overlap going forward either.

Sachin Salgaonkar
BofA Securities, Research Division

Very small clarification, Mohit, we saw the NCLT approval for MakeMyTrip and the redBus merger, which in a way sort of removes any legal or regulatory overhang from a potential India IPO point of view. So any revised time lines we should look from an IPO point of view? That's it for me.

Mohit Kabra
Senior Vice President of Finance, Administration & Legal and Additional Director

No, not really. I think should we kind of think of that, we'll kind of come back separately. Just as you know, we have been kind of in this restructuring process. A couple of years back, we had done a legal entity restructuring wherein when got the OTA businesses to kind of come together. And now all the key operating businesses have been brought under a single legal entity. But yes, it does facilitate an eventual IPO at some point in time to that extent. But no real kind of change in thought process over there.

Vipul Garg
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

The next question is from the line of Manish Adukia of Goldman.

Manish Adukia
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

So I wanted to just go back to the growth discussion we were having in the earlier part of the call. So I understand, Mohit, what you explained in terms of volume being extremely strong, 20% plus and GBV 15% because of GST. But why should revenue growth get impacted? Do you get paid from the hotels basis, the GBV or the actual revenue that they recognize? And I would have imagined that if growth is faster in mid- to premium -- sorry, mid- to budget hotels, technically, your take rate should expand because you typically would have higher take rates in mid- to budget compared to premium hotels. So I'm unable to reconcile the revenue slowdown. I understand GBV slowdown there, but I'm unable to understand the revenue bit. So if you can just explain that, that will be great. That's my first question.

Mohit Kabra
Senior Vice President of Finance, Administration & Legal and Additional Director

Yes. No, just to kind of repeat it, Manish, if you really look at our margins largely come in on the booking value, right? And therefore, the impact in a manner of sort kind of flows both into the booking value as well as into the overall margin -- absolute margin that we get. So the percentage doesn't change, but the absolute margin that we get kind of gets impacted as well. But I think like we have been calling this out even last quarter, when this change had come in, we were calling it out as a significant positive because see, this just helps unlock kind of volumes or demand, particularly at the price point, which is very sensitive, right? Customers are kind of pretty price sensitive in the mid- to kind of budget segment. And therefore, this is an important unlock.

And therefore, if you really look at it, the growth has actually kind of accelerated very nicely through this quarter, in fact, not just only in hotels, but across segments. Despite domestic air being at a very marginal kind of a growth for us and for the industry, our overall segment growth across all segments that we report also stood at about 22%. So I think I'm kind of more taking encouragement from the fact that the segment growth or the volume-led growth continues to be strong. The rest is largely kind of a play out of the changes in the landscape, and they will get kind of normalized over a 4-quarter period.

Manish Adukia
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

And your air growth, of course, in the quarter was impacted by what happened with IndiGo and hotels were extremely strong, partly driven by the GST cut on volume. But would the hotel volume growth, in your opinion, have been even faster without the IndiGo disruption? Like I mean, I'm just trying to think that from here on, even on volume, is there room to accelerate in the foreseeable future?

Mohit Kabra
Senior Vice President of Finance, Administration & Legal and Additional Director

Needless to mention, Manish, actually, flights is a lead indicator, right? It kind of -- if you look at the entire travel plans, for most Indians, they start with a flight booking and then everything else follows, right? So I think what we are trying to do is that whatever is the significant kind of adverse impact coming in from the disruption on the flight side, to large extent, we are trying to mitigate it through other modes of transport. And therefore, if you see we have been dialing up or kind of seeing good growth on the bus ticketing side, also on intercity cabs, et cetera. So I think the -- clearly could have benefited with -- without the disruption on the flight side and if I really look at it very briefly in terms of how the growth has panned out between the months during the quarter, clearly, December was a month of much slower growth for us and therefore, kind of, again, indicates the same. So would have helped. But I think given the circumstances, the hotel growth was very, very encouraging.

Manish Adukia
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

No, absolutely. And just a couple of other follow-up questions from earlier. On the overall spend on marketing and promotion at 5.6%, one of the highest we've seen in recent periods. Again, is there like some bit of like one-off there? I mean, should it go back to the sub-5% number you've in the past indicated? And again, is part of that a function of the fact that, again, when budget or mid hotels grow faster and they probably have a higher component of marketing promotion that impacted. So I just want to understand the outlook also on that number. And then I just have one last follow-up question after that.

Mohit Kabra
Senior Vice President of Finance, Administration & Legal and Additional Director

Yes, absolutely, no one-offs. In fact, two parts to it. One, I would say, is the very fact that low-margin businesses like air ticketing have seen an adverse impact on growth, right? And therefore, the growth has come in predominantly from higher-margin businesses. Now what that means is clearly, you're kind of getting a much better improvement in the blended margin for the business as a whole. So if you were to look at adjusted margins across segments and then look at it probably as a percentage of gross bookings, then it would look much more healthier [indiscernible] the customer acquisition cost also. So it's completely linked to the mix shift.

And then within that mix shift, also the fact that there is slightly more accentuation towards the budget to kind of mid-segment of hotels, where, again, the customer action cost tends to be slightly higher. So I think purely reflective of the mix. And therefore, if you really see, despite the 5.6%, it has had no impact in terms of the adjusted operating number that continues to be 1.8% plus as a percentage of gross bookings. So just wanted to call that out. And it's very difficult. Like I said, the mix and the blended margins were very different, say, until about a year back and are much -- very different in this 1-year period due to these one-offs that have got played out.

Manish Adukia
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Then maybe just my last question, taking a step back and looking at the overall business, 20% constant currency revenue growth in the quarter, which was a fairly noisy quarter, which, in my opinion, is a very good outcome. But when we think about, let's say, over a 1- to 3-year outlook, is it fair to say that to deliver 20% growth, you have to continue to reinvest in business and margins don't expand, which means over a period of time, your EBITDA growth broadly tracks revenue growth because I would have thought that in a country like India, if revenues are growing at 20%, operating costs probably grow at a lower pace. Is that something that may not play out? I mean, is it not an operating leverage story anymore and margins will largely be in line to where they are? Or how should we think about the growth outlook versus the EBITDA growth outlook, revenue growth versus EBITDA growth? That's my last question.

Mohit Kabra
Senior Vice President of Finance, Administration & Legal and Additional Director

Sure. If you look at it over the last 5, 10 years, we've clearly called out that a substantial portion of the margin improvement that was supposed to come in, leveraging volumes and leveraging penetration and building kind of market leadership in each of the segments of the business, that's largely played out between, I would say, by 2024, right? So -- and thereafter, we have been calling out that our customer acquisition costs are actually inefficient right now, and we don't really look at kind of dialing them down. We'd rather kind of keep focusing on dialing up growth and looking at growing in the 20s.

And that opportunity is getting delivered despite the market growth coming down very significantly, at least in this year, right, across quarters. So I think the -- I would say a large part of our objectives considering the mix where we are. So for instance, where the accommodation mix is still in the 40s, right? So till the time we remain in the 40s and say, closer or the sub-50% mark, we do believe our adjusted operating margins are kind of pretty healthy. I've always given the example of the global players and how their kind of the best-in-class margins play out.

And if we just kind of superimpose our mix over there, this margin percentage looks very healthy. So I think we will really need now the mix going beyond the 50% mark for any significant kind of improvement on the adjusted operating margins to play out. Until then, I think the operating leverage will likely come in more from the more fixed and variable costs, which again is very small. So in our case, the fixed costs are just about probably like about 20%, 25% of the overall expenses. And therefore, the improvements are going to be much smaller in nature, in line with what we have seen in the last 2 years or so compared to what we have seen in the 5 years before that.

Vipul Garg
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

The next question is from the line of Vijit Jain of Citi.

Vijit Jain
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

So my question, in the hotel segment, with the GST cut, did demand somewhat shift also from higher ticket size to sub INR 7,500 category? And within that, given that you even called out that growth did accelerate here. So is that because in general, you have better selection in that category and therefore, some market shift -- market share shift might have happened from others or from offline or other channels to you? Is that something that happened here?

Mohit Kabra
Senior Vice President of Finance, Administration & Legal and Additional Director

So Vijit, as you know, on the premium side, we pretty much have all the kind of hotels that are available in the country on the platform. So most of our expansion actually keeps happening more in the mid- to premium kind of or more in the mid- to budget or more in the budget segment, right, from a price point of view, where we keep adding more and more kind of hotels on the platform because there's a much larger kind of number of hotels in that particular price point, which still need to be kind of contracted and put on the platform, except for maybe new hotels, which come across all price points.

So that improvement in the bouquet of offerings in the budget segment will keep increasing. No doubt about that. But this is more, I think, what we saw during the quarter was more on account of the significant price differential, which has now emerged in the sub INR 7,500 versus, say, for instance, the INR 7,500 to INR 9,000 or INR 10,000 price range because there, you now suddenly get a significant kind of impact coming in from the steep change in the GST rates. So that's seeing a lot more of the volume kind of coming through in the sub- INR 7,500 price range.

In fact, a lot of the hotels who were on the marginal side, just above the INR 7,500 price would have also wanted to kind of bring their prices in line for the overall customer benefit to play out. So that's what's kind of playing out, and that's what we have seen, largely on expected lines. And like I said, there has been a little bit of a share shift. From a volume point of view, we have seen roughly about, close to about 3% shift happening from premium, super premium to maybe more like the mid- to kind of budget segment. And again, on the overall mix also roughly about 4% to 5%, whether in terms of gross booking value or in terms of adjusted margins. So yes, but this is very much on expected lines. Like I was saying, the real underneath benefit of it is it's really helped unlock demand in the overall hotels segment.

Vijit Jain
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

My second question, just riffing on your comments earlier, Rajesh, on Agentic AI and LLMs and those things. I'm just wondering if trip planning is what moves to LLM and trip planning is arguably on search versus LLM, LLM offers much better experience. Does that mean that it could accelerate further your online shift in categories like international or other packages and stuff where traditionally, people have used agents because it's complex and LLMs make it easier. Could that conversely actually help online shift in India?

Rajesh Magow
Co-Founder, Group CEO & Director

No, I think it's an interesting take, Vijit, I must say. Yes, quite possible. See, listen, in any case, overall across the categories, not necessarily on travel and within travel also, all segments directionally going in that direction only from offline to online. And can we say that the digital agents tomorrow or even on the trip planning when it is becoming more popular, I don't know whether the trip planning per se because I could also argue that even historically, the people were going to Google and searching and doing some bit of trip planning there, right, or going to TripAdvisor to do some trip planning specifically or coming to OTAs to do some part of trip planning, et cetera.

So I don't know whether that per se will sort of trigger this shift. But I think what is potentially -- what can potentially trigger is actually what we have built, which is Myra is a digital agent because it is interactive, because you can ask the question in your language that you are comfortable and you can look for complex itineraries, ask as many questions as you want, and you will get accurate answers. And then along with that, the booking will also be stitching in a very smooth manner.

That might actually help because the hypothesis is that you're going to a travel agent or human travel agent to ask for help specifically for customization, right? And now you can achieve that customization on the digital agent as well, almost as effectively, if not better, as you would do it with the other alternative, right, so that you were doing it or you were using it earlier. I think that might actually help do the shift or accelerate the shift better. I'm not sure only trip planning. The only trip planning where trip planning could help is that where overall sort of inspiration for travel goes because that, in any case, is happening. The consumer behavior is changing in spending more and more on travel in any case.

So you go on your preferred either the social media channel for inspiration and then come to, let's say, horizontal search or an OTA like MakeMyTrip to do trip planning and you find it easier and smoother, and inspiring you to travel more and more, whether it is domestic or an easy sort of travel use case or a complex travel use case, that potentially can definitely help. But specific to international travel, I think unlock might be the digital agent more, which is answering all the questions and also stitching the booking experience together and also post sales and in trip in a single interface, that might actually help sort of trigger that shift.

Vijit Jain
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

And my last question, on the total marketing spend, which I think to Manish's question earlier, you mentioned how mix shift has contributed to it rising to 5.6%. So as air recovers maybe from the summer season onwards or maybe even marginal recovery Q-o-Q in the March quarter, does it trend -- does your total spend trend back towards what you've previously said, 5% to 5.5%?

Mohit Kabra
Senior Vice President of Finance, Administration & Legal and Additional Director

Most likely, Vijit. It should start kind of reflecting the mix because like I said, there's nothing in terms of a one-off over here, and therefore, it should start reflecting the mix depending upon what kind of changes we see over there.

Vipul Garg
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

The last question we will take from the line of [Gaurav Singhal] of WFM Asia.

Unknown Analyst

So just a couple of questions. One is the net take rate on air is about 7% this quarter, 7.2% last quarter. Is that a normal number? Or is it running higher than a normal range of like 6.5% or so?

Mohit Kabra
Senior Vice President of Finance, Administration & Legal and Additional Director

Yes. I think it generally kind of trends to range around this mark. It can be about 0.5 percentage point lower or higher depending upon what kind of fares are prevailing, depending upon the kind of lag between booking versus [frown], et cetera. So nothing exceptional out over here, Gaurav.

And then the second question is going back to the hotels and packages business. So when we think of the constant currency bookings growth of 15%, I think you explained it as volume growth of 20% and then 5 points of impact from GST. But then apart from volume and GST impact, there is also pricing where all these hotel companies report like pretty decent ADR growth. So for you, the price -- net pricing growth is like 0 almost, right? So I guess there is some price growth and then negative mix impact, which is canceling each other. But if I just think about going forward, let's say, next 1 year, where you mentioned for the next 4 quarters, this GST impact will hit you. Are we thinking of broadly an algorithm where your constant currency GBV growth will be like 5 percentage points below your volume growth like it was this quarter? Or does that gap sequentially keep reducing? Maybe if you can share a 1-year view as well as a 2-, 3-year view, that will be helpful.

Directionally. See, directionally, it is only just a 1-year impact because the comparable number for the previous year is at a different kind of GST rate. So therefore, it's just more an optical thing than anything which is kind of actually impacting the business. So this is more optical and don't see any real impact as such over here. Sorry, I missed the first part of your second question. What was that?

I got that, Mohit. Maybe I'll just quickly address that. In terms of -- Gaurav, to your point on hotel companies reporting higher price rise and all, you should just be mindful on one thing. See, what you are looking at it is only a few data points, like, let's say, listed companies reporting some. And again, their ADRs have also not significantly gone high on our platform across the segments we are selling hotels, right? And on a blended basis, where there is a possibility in one particular segment in certain cities, some -- because of the demand-supply gap, et cetera, some price movement would have happened. But as a general trend, on a blended basis across the segments if we do and even if we sort of look at different, different segment hotels, whether it's a budget hotel segment or a mid-segment or a premium and then super premium kind of segment, we haven't really seen any price increase, which is extraordinary or out of the ordinary now happening.

So it's actually that era is over. It is actually pretty stable now. And you would only see either because of seasonality, there will be some movement or there will be an inflationary increase year-on-year, right? So I don't think we should jump to conclusion that the average selling price for a particular room night across the board, the rates have only gone up in pretty much every segment. I thought I'll just clarify that because in our -- on our platform, we also have out of our hotel and packages business about 10% home stays. Now home stays pricing and year-on-year and across segments. And therefore, on a blended basis across the board and pan-India basis, if you would see, there is no significant price increase on the -- except for the seasonality impact that we've seen.

Maybe just one last follow-up on domestic hotels business. So at least among the listed OTA players, we don't see anyone else having any meaningful hotel business right now. So at least in the domestic segment, is that a fair conclusion that there is not really much competition? And when we look at like the broader industry data, hotel, domestic plus international there, we see -- I guess, you have competition from these global players. But let's say, at least on the domestic segment, would it be fair to conclude that you would be the one dominating and then not my competition?

Mohit Kabra
Senior Vice President of Finance, Administration & Legal and Additional Director

Reasonably fair to say. But just keep in mind that in the overall online penetration in the segment is still in the early stages. So there's a long headroom over there. But fairly in the right direction.
