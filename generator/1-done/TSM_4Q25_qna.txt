Question-and-Answer Session

Jeff Su
Director of Investor Relations

[Operator Instructions] So now let's begin the question-and-answer session. I think we'll take the first few questions from the floor here. So why don't we start over here with Gokul Hariharan from JPMorgan.

Gokul Hariharan
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So C.C., it definitely feels like you have heard what your customers have said to you over the last 3, 4 months. Could you give us a little bit more color on what you're hearing from your customers' customers on demand because this is a very big step-up in the capacity commitment. There is definitely a lot of concern in the financial market, especially about whether we are in a bit of a bubble. And obviously, you are the one who is putting up all the capital in this industry. So you've definitely considered this very careful as well. So give us a little bit more detail in terms of what you're hearing from the customers and your views on the cycle, given if you think about typical semiconductor cycle, we've already probably lasted a little longer than usual cycles, but this is definitely doesn't feel like a typical semiconductor cycle.

Jeff Su
Director of Investor Relations

Okay. Gokul, let me summarize your question for the benefit of those online and those in-person. So again, Gokul's question is really, he would like to hear C.C.'s views about the overall AI-related demand and the semiconductor cycle. So again, Gokul notes that as Wendell and you said, we are substantially stepping up our CapEx to support the customers. But he does say there is concerns about an AI bubble and risk. So part of Gokul's question is how -- what is the feedback? Any color we can share about what type of discussions and feedback we're getting from both customers and the customers' customers that C.C. mentioned. And how long do we think this cycle can last?

C.C. Wei
Chairman & CEO

Okay. Gokul, you essentially try to ask us, say, whether the AI demand is real or not. I'm also very nervous about it. You bet because we have to invest about USD 52 billion to USD 56 billion for the CapEx, right? If we didn't do it carefully, and that would be big disaster to TSMC for sure. So of course, I spend a lot of time in the last 3, 4 months talking to my customer and end customers' customer. I want to make sure that my customers demand are real. So I talked to those cloud service providers, all of them.

The answer is that I'm quite satisfied with the answer. Actually, they show me the evidence that the AI really help their business. So they grow their business successfully and healthy in their financial return. So I also double check their financial status. They are very rich. That sounds much better than TSMC.

So no doubt, I also asked specifically that what's application, right? I mean that's -- for one of the hyperscalers, they told me that, that helped their social media software. And so the customer continue to increase. So I believe that. And with our own experience in the AI application, we also help to our own fab to improve the productivity. As I mentioned, 1 time say that 1% or 2% productivity improvement, that is free to the TSMC.

And that's where also our gross margin is a little bit satisfied even if this very high post period of time. And so all in all, I believe in my point of view, the AI is real, not only real, it's starting to grow into our daily life. And we believe that is kind of -- we call it AI megatrend, we certainly would believe that. So you -- another question is can the semiconductor industry to be good for 3, 4, 5 years in a row, I'd tell you the truth, I don't know.

But I look at the AI, it looks like it's going to be like an endless, I mean, that for many years to come. No matter what, TSMC stick on the fundamental technology leadership, manufacturing excellence, and we work with customers to get their trust. And I think that fundamental thing position TSMC to be very good future growth, let me say that, 25% CAGR as we projected, and we used to be conservative. You know that.

Gokul Hariharan
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

My second question is on the U.S. expansion. You're pulling in some of the capacity in response to customers. You're already starting planned for the Phase 4. There's a lot of media reports about TSMC, you might have to build more fabs in the U.S. How should we think about U.S. expansion in principle over the next few years? I think previously, you had talked about reaching 20% or even 30% of 2-nanometer capacity in the U.S. eventually, the total capacity would be in the U.S. Could you give us a little bit more detail about how that is progressing? And when could we get there in terms of the 30% or even 20% capacity?

Jeff Su
Director of Investor Relations

Okay. So Gokul's second question is about our overseas expansion, particularly in the U.S. He knows that C.C. said, we are pulling in the schedule for fab 2 earlier. We're starting the application for the fourth fab. And so his question is partly around recent reports that we intend to build more fabs in Arizona. So his question is how should we or how is TSMC thinking about the future expansion in Arizona.

And we have said in the past that around 30% of our 2-nanometer and more advanced capacity would be based in Arizona once we complete scaling out to this independent giga-fab cluster, so what is the time frame, more timetable for that? How quickly can we get there?

C.C. Wei
Chairman & CEO

That's a long question. We built a fab in Arizona, and we work hard. So today, everything, even the yield or defect density is almost equal to Taiwan. And due to the strong demand, as I just answered from the AI stronger, that's a megatrend. All my customer and AI customers in the U.S., so they ask a lot of support from the U.S. fab.

So because of that, we have to speed up our fab expansion in Arizona. In Taiwan also actually, we increased most of the capacity in Taiwan. No doubt about it because this is the most adjacent one we can progress very well. In the U.S., we try to speed it up and the progress is very good. We got the help from the government. But still, we have to meet all the requirement for the permits, for those kind of things. And so both in Taiwan and in Arizona, we speeded up our capacity expansion to meet the AI demand.

I can always say one word. The capacity is very tight. We work very hard to narrow the gap so far. Probably this year, next year, we have to work extremely hard to narrow the gap, okay? We just bought a second land in Arizona. That gives you a hint. That's what we plan to do because we need it. We are going to expand many fabs over there and this giga-fab cluster can help us to improve the productivity, to lower down the cost and to serve our customers in the U.S. better.

Jeff Su
Director of Investor Relations

Okay. Thank you, Gokul. Let's move over here next to Laura Chen from Citibank, please.

Chia Yi Chen
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Thank you, C.C. and Wendell for very comprehensive outlook briefing and also congratulate for the great results. Of course, we see that the AI semiconductor growth has seen very strong growth. And I believe all of your customers and customers' customers very desperate to add more capacity support from TSMC. But I'm just wondering how does TSMC evaluate the potential power electricity supply for data center. So other than that, the chips we can discuss with our customers, I think for the overall infrastructure buildup for data center, a lot of factors also very important. Just want to understand more how does TSMC evaluate those key factors for the AI infrastructure buildup? That's my first question.

Jeff Su
Director of Investor Relations

Okay. So Laura's first question is around the AI demand. She notes, again, as we said, AI megatrend and the growth is very strong and customers, customers' customers and ourselves are strong believers. But when we do our planning, how do we balance this against the other considerations? Do we look at things, for example, I think Laura's question is powering electricity grid availability to basically assess is this part of our -- included as part of our planning process, do we factor such things in?

C.C. Wei
Chairman & CEO

Well, Laura, let me tell you first. I worry about the electricity in Taiwan first. I need to have a lot of enough electricity, so I can start to expand the capacity without any limitation. But talking about build a lot of AI data center all over the world, I use one of my customers' customers I answer because I ask the same question.

They told me that they plan this one 5, 6 years ago already. So as I said, those cloud service providers are smart, very smart. If I knew that, I will -- anyway. So they say that they work on the power supply 5, 6 years ago. So today, their message to me is silicon from TSMC is a bottleneck and ask me not to pay attention to all others because they have to solve the silicon bottleneck first.

But indeed, we look at the power supply all over the world, especially in the U.S. Not only that, we also look at the who support those kind of power supply like a turbine, like the nuclear power plant, the plant or those kind of things. We also look at the supplier of the rack. We also look at the supplier of the cooling system, everything. So far, so good. So we have to work hard to narrow the gap between the demand and supply from TSMC. Did that answer your question?

Chia Yi Chen
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

That's great to know that it will not be the constraint for the further AI developments. Yes. And my second question is on the leading-edge advanced packaging. And Wendell, can you remind us that what would be the revenue contribution last year for the advanced packaging overall? First of all, we see that -- I recall that in the past that the CapEx for leading-edge advanced packaging is roughly about 10%. Yes. But now it could be up to like 20%. So I'm just wondering that for the expansion, can you give us more detail about what kind of the plans you are looking for.

Will you focus more on like 3DIC, SoIC? Or you also start to work on more advanced like panel based in the longer term? I also think before we talk about that, we'll work more closely with OSATs partner on the leading-edge advanced packaging. So just wondering what kind of the process will be the key expansion plan in the space.

Jeff Su
Director of Investor Relations

Okay. So Laura's second question is more related to advanced packaging. What was the revenue contribution of what we call the back end, which is advanced packaging testing as a whole in 2025. And then she notes the CapEx, actually, this year, I believe, Wendell, we guided 10% to 20% of CapEx, which is the same as last year. But anyways, she wants to know what is the focus of this CapEx? Is it on 3DIC? Is it on SoIC packaging solutions, is on panel level? Sort of what is the key areas we're focusing on relative to the CapEx?

Jen-Chau Huang
Senior VP of Finance & CFO

Okay. Laura, the revenue contribution last year from advanced packaging is close to 10%. It's about 8%. For this year, we expect it to be slightly over 10%. Okay. We expect it to grow in the next 5 years, higher or faster than the corporate. And the CapEx, yes, you're right, in the past, it's about 10%, lower than 10%. Now we're saying advanced packaging together with mask making and others accounted for between 10% to 20%. So you can see that the investment amount is higher. And we're investing in areas in advanced packaging where our customers need. So the areas that you mentioned, basically, we continue to invest.

Jeff Su
Director of Investor Relations

Thank you, Wendell. Okay, let's move on to Charlie Chan from Morgan Stanley here.

Charlie Chan
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So first of all, amazing results and guidance. Congratulations to the management team. So my first question is about outside of AI, what do you see for those end markets, right? You talked about the memory costs, et cetera. So can you give us some your underlying assumption for PC shipments, smartphone shipments, et cetera? And also in your HPC, there are some other business like networking and general servers. Can you comment about the growth potential for those segments?

Jeff Su
Director of Investor Relations

Okay. Charlie's first question is very specific. Well, generally, he wants to know about how do we see the non-AI demand, especially in the context where the certain component costs such as memory costs are rising. So he wants to know what do we see the impact on the PC and smartphone markets in terms of shipments. He's also asking very specifically, what about networking, what about general server, each of these different segments.

C.C. Wei
Chairman & CEO

Charlie, those -- although we say it's call non-AI, but actually that's related to AI, you know that, right? Because the networking processor, you still need to have AI data to scale up or scale out. Those are the networking switches or those kind of things still grow very strong. As for PC or the smartphone, to tell the truth, we expect higher memory price. So we expect the unit growth will be very minimal.

But for TSMC, we did not feel our customer change their behavior. And we look at it and then we found out that we supply most of the high-end smartphones. The high-end smartphone is less sensitive to the memory price. So the demand is still strong. Using one sentence, I'd like to say we still try very hard to narrow the gap. We have to supply a lot of wafers to them also.

Charlie Chan
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I think that's very consistent with your 5-year CAGR outlook for all the 4 segments. And my second question is about the Intel's foundry competition. I think U.S. President seems to be very happy with Intel's recent progress. And even mentioned 2 of your key customers, right, NVIDIA, Apple may have a sound partnership with Intel Foundry. Should we concern about this so-called competition? And what TSMC can really do to mitigate or avoid potential market share loss at those key U.S. customers, not limited to the 2 customers I just mentioned.

Jeff Su
Director of Investor Relations

Okay. So Charlie's second question is on the foundry competition and competition from a U.S. IDM. He knows U.S. President is very happy with the progress. A couple -- 2 of our key customers. He also was mentioned. So his question is fundamentally, is there a concern or risk going forward of market share loss for TSMC to our foundry competition?

C.C. Wei
Chairman & CEO

Well, kind of a simple question, I should say, no. Let me explain a little bit because in these days, it's not a money to help you to compete, right? I also like whoever you just mentioned, to invest on Intel, I like them to invest on TSMC also. But the most fundamental thing is let me share with you. Today's technology is so complicated. So once you want to design a very complete or advanced technology, it takes 2 to 3 years to fully utilize that technology.

That's today's situation. And so after 2 to 3 years of preparation, you can design your product. Once you get your product being approved, it takes another 1 to 2 years to ramp it up. So we have a competitor, no doubt about it. That's a formidable competitor.

But first, it takes time; two, we don't underestimate their progress. But are we afraid of it? For 30-some years, we're always in a competition with our competitors. So no, we have confidence to keep our business grow as we estimate.

Jeff Su
Director of Investor Relations

Thank you, C.C. All right. Let's take the next 2 questions online in the interest of time. Operator, can we take the first call from the line, please?

Operator

First question on the line, Macquarie.

Yu Jang Lai
Macquarie Research

First, congrats, very strong performance. My first question is about the global capacity plan. Recently Taiwan local news report that TSMC could exit the 8-inch business and mature node, 12-inch to convert into the advanced packaging. And the investors is keen to know if this is true. And the decision is based on what kind of key factor, i.e. C.C. just mentioned about the power tightness or it's ROI concern?

Jeff Su
Director of Investor Relations

Okay. So Arthur's first question is about basically mature node. Our strategy on mature node. He knows a local news has been reporting that TSMC is exiting 8-inch and 12-inch businesses and converting the capacity to advanced packaging. So he wants to know if this is true. And if so, what are the reasons behind the power constraints, ROI, et cetera, et cetera?

C.C. Wei
Chairman & CEO

Good question. Indeed, we reduced our 8-inch wafers capacity and 6-inch. But let me assure you that we support all our customers. We discuss with our customers and to do this kind of resources more flexible and more -- what is the word we say optimize, which I should. Optimize the resources to support our customer.

But let me assure you also to my customer, well, we continue to support them. We will not let them down. If they have a good business, we continue to support that even in the 8-inch wafer business.

Jeff Su
Director of Investor Relations

Okay. Arthur, do you have a second question?

Yu Jang Lai
Macquarie Research

Yes. My second question is regarding the consumer and demand outlook. So C.C. also mentioned that the memory price actually inflation and he also pushing up the cost of the consumer electronics. So investors actually are concerned about the further demand softness in this year and next year or particularly next year. So can management comment about what your client or your clients' client, how to resolve this memory tightness or we call memory urgency issue?

Jeff Su
Director of Investor Relations

Okay. So Arthur's second question is on the impact from the memory price increase and the demand softness. I believe this question really because C.C. already shared the impact this year. He wants to know what is the impact for 2027?

C.C. Wei
Chairman & CEO

For TSMC, no impact. As I just mentioned, most of my customers now focus on high-end smartphone or PCs. So those kind of demand has less sensitive to the components price. So they continue to give us a very healthy forecast this year and next year.

Jeff Su
Director of Investor Relations

Okay. Thank you, C.C. All right. Let's -- operator, let's move on to the next participant from the line, please.

Operator

Next one, Brett Simpson, Arete.

Brett Simpson
Arete Research Services LLP

My question is really on AI. I mean, TSMC has been supply constrained for your AI customers, I think, since 2024, and it sounds like 2026 is another year where we're going to see challenges. Do you think the CapEx you've laid out for this year. TWD 52 billion to TWD 56 billion, could that mean that we start to see supply and demand more in balance in 2027? Any thoughts there just in terms of how you're thinking about that capacity plan? And does it alleviate the supply bottlenecks that we see today?

And as part of this, from a supply perspective, we hear TSMC is finding it quite challenging to develop enough engineering talent quick enough, both in the U.S. and in Taiwan. Can you talk more about this trend? And what's the scale of the labor shortage of foundry engineers at the moment?

Jeff Su
Director of Investor Relations

Okay. So Brett's first question is related around AI and our capacity. So he notes, the supply looks to continue to be tight in 2026. But with the significant step-up in our CapEx to support the customers, TWD 52 billion to TWD 56 billion, do we expect the supply/demand or the gap, so to speak, to be more balanced in 2027?

And then is engineering resources, fab engineers a constraint or a bottleneck for us in making these expansions, whether in Taiwan or the U.S.?

C.C. Wei
Chairman & CEO

Okay. Let me answer this question first. If you build a new fab, it takes 2 and 3 years -- 2 to 3 years to build a new fab. So even we start to spend the TWD 52 billion to TWD 56 billion, the contribution to this year almost none and to 2027, a little bit. So we actually are looking for 2028, 2029 supply.

And we hope at that time that the gap will be narrow. For 2026 and 2027, we are focused on the short-term more output. Actually, our productivity continue to increase. Our people has an incentive because of one of the TSMC's incentive is to satisfy customer. It's not because of our financial results are good, but we want to let customer feel that TSMC is trusted that whenever, they have a good opportunity to grow, we will support it.

So in 2026, 2027, for the short term, we focus on the productivity improvement, which we've done quite a good result because of, Wendell just mentioned that we can have a good financial result because of that. But that's not our incentive -- that's our incentive, but that's not our purpose. Our purpose is to support our customers. So 2026, 2027 for the short term, we are looking to improve our productivity. 2028, 2029, yes, we start to increase our CapEx significantly, and it will continue this way if the AI demand megatrend as we expected.

Jeff Su
Director of Investor Relations

Brett -- thank you, C.C. Brett, do you have a second question?

Brett Simpson
Arete Research Services LLP

Yes, I do. That was very clear. I guess my second question is about pricing. And if I look at 2025, this was the second consecutive year where TSMC's wafer ASPs were up around 20%. And as leading edge becomes a bigger portion of the mix and also you feed through price increases. When we factor in the ramp of more expensive overseas fabs, is 20% ASP -- wafer ASP increases the new normal for TSMC? Typically, you have an annual price negotiation about this time of the year. And so I'm trying to understand how you project ASPs in '26. And is your March quarter guidance factoring in price increases at leading edge?

Jeff Su
Director of Investor Relations

Okay. So Brett's question is on pricing. He notes that our -- which he looking at the blended wafer price is increasing close to 20% according to his estimates. Of course, that's blended both on price and mix, but it's a leading edge and also we have mentioned earning our value. So he wants to know is the new normal going forward?

C.C. Wei
Chairman & CEO

This is a tough question. I'll get the CFO to answer.

Jen-Chau Huang
Senior VP of Finance & CFO

Okay. Every new node that we have a price. The price will increase. The blended ASP will increase I think they continue this way in the past and will continue with the way going forward. But Brett, I think you're asking about the contribution from pricing to the profitability.

Now as we mentioned before, the profitability, there are 6 factors affecting the profitability. And price is just one of them. And of course, we continue trying to earn our value. But in fact, in the last few years, the pricing benefits to the profitability was just enough to cover the inflation cost from tools, equipment, materials, labor, et cetera. There are other factors contributing to the higher profitability.

The first one will be a high utilization rate. As the demand is so high and as our disciplined approach to capacity planning, the utilization rate supports our high profitability. The other 1 will be our manufacturing excellence. As C.C. said, we continue to drive increasing productivity to generate more wafer output. Also, we continue to drive optimization capacity among nodes, which includes converting part of the N5 to N3.

It also involves cross support from different nodes from the mature nodes to the more advanced nodes. That is a very important advantage of TSMC. So with all these efforts, we're able to maintain a good, healthy, sustainable return profitability so that we can continue to invest to support our customers' growth.

Jeff Su
Director of Investor Relations

Okay. In the interest of time, we'll take 2 more questions from the floor and 1 more from the line. So we'll go here, Sunny Lin, UBS and then...

Sunny Lin
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Very strong results. Congratulations. So number one, if we look at the company, very different versus in the past from many angles. But if we look at the ramp from new node, now you can generate actually higher revenue from new node in year 4 or even year 5 of mass production versus in the past, new node like peak revenue in the second or even third year of mass production. And so could you help us understand what this new trend, what's the financial implications? And then what does that imply for you to operate or even compete differently versus in the past?

Jeff Su
Director of Investor Relations

So Sunny's first question, I think maybe is related, well, to our technology differentiation, but she knows that when we ramp a new -- in the past, when we have a new node after a few years, sort of the revenue comes down a bit, but she notes that nowadays, we can still enjoy very high revenue from a node even after in its fourth or fifth year. So her question is what are the financial implications from this and also from a, I believe, competitive dynamics?

C.C. Wei
Chairman & CEO

If I can answer, say we are lucky. Actually, if you -- if you look at the semiconductors product, right now, the trend is you need to have a lower power consumption always and then high-speed performance. And for TSMC, our technology depreciation becomes more and more clear, we have both benefit. We have a high speed, and we have a low power consumption. And so our leading edge customer, the first wave, the second wave, the third wave continue to come and so that sustain the demand for a long, long time.

That's a difference. Of course, this one, you need to have technology leadership, and which the technology leadership much easier to say. But every year, you have to improve. As we said, we have N2, N2P and then you won't be surprised, and the third one will be N2 something and continuously. And so that one give us the benefit and to support our customers continuous innovation.

And so they continue to stay with TSMC. And so their product can be very competitive in the market. So that answers the question say that once we got the peak revenue and did not decrease, it's continuous because second wave, third wave customers continue to join.

Sunny Lin
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Thank you very much, C.C. And then maybe a question on 2 nanometer, which you should see meaningful revenue coming through in 2026. And so in the past, you guide like how much a new node will contribute to sales for the year. And so any expectations on the revenue contribution from 2-nanometer in 2026? And then I recall in terms of process migration, a few years ago, there were a lot of concerns on increasing cost per transistor. And that obviously is not declining from 5-nanometer? But then now looking at 2-nanometer, I think process migration seems to be reaccelerating even for smartphone and PC and then with larger demand coming from high-bandwidth compute. And so maybe based on your feedback from clients, maybe for smartphone and PC clients, why are they reaccelerating process migration into 2-nanometer?

Jeff Su
Director of Investor Relations

Okay. So Sunny's second question very quickly in 2 parts, 2 nanometers, as we said, is a fast ramp in 2026, very strong customer interest and demand. So what -- do we have any revenue percentage to guide for in 2026?

Jen-Chau Huang
Senior VP of Finance & CFO

Yes. Sunny, the 2-nanometer will be a bigger node than 3-nanometer from the start, okay? But it's less meaningful nowadays to talk about the percentage of revenue contribution when the new node starts because the corporate, as a whole, the revenue has become much bigger than before. So yes, revenue dollar, it's a bigger node. But percentage-wise, less meaningful.

Jeff Su
Director of Investor Relations

Okay. And then the second part of Sunny's question from a technology perspective, as she noted increasing cost per transistor, as we said, CapEx per k going higher. So the question very simply, what's the value? What's driving smartphone, HPC customers actually to see -- we're seeing a widening out of the adoption of N2. So what is the value that is providing that the customers are willing to adopt N2?

C.C. Wei
Chairman & CEO

I already answered the question, right? Because now the whole product is looking for lower power consumption and high-speed performance. And our technology can provide that value. I also say that every year, we improve. So every year, they adopt the same -- even the same name of the same node, their products continue to improve. So that provides the value. It's -- if you say that the cost per transistor is increasing, I saw the cost per transistor, the performance compared to call the CP value is increased, is much better. So that customer stick with the TSMC. Our headache right now, if I can call it a headache, is a demand and supply gap. We need to work hard to narrow the gap.

Jeff Su
Director of Investor Relations

Operator, can we take the last call from the line, and we'll take one last one from the floor.

Operator

Next one, Krish Sankar, TD Cowen.

Jeff Su
Director of Investor Relations

Okay. Krish, are you there? I guess not. Then let's just take the last -- not call -- sorry, the last question from Bruce Lu from Goldman Sachs.

Zheng Lu
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Thank you for letting me to ask the last question. Hopefully, it's not that difficult. So I think one of the key -- I understand that TSMC is trying very hard to increase the capacity. AI revenue is growing like 15% a year, 15% plus a year. But token consumption for the last few quarters is 15% a quarter. So the gap is still there, right? I mean that's why [indiscernible] was talking about the chip war. So can you share with us that in your assumption when you provide 50% plus AI revenue growth, what kind of token consumption you can support? And how many gigawatts power in terms of the chips you can support in your assumption when you provide this kind of 5 years revenue guidance for AI?

Jeff Su
Director of Investor Relations

Okay. So Bruce's first question is around our AI CAGR. Actually, to be correct, we have guided for the AI CAGR to grow mid- to high 50s CAGR in the 5-year period from 2024 to 2029. So that is the official guidance we have provided just today. Bruce's question is, in this guidance, what is our assumption basically assuming about the token growth behind this type of CAGR? What is our assumption in terms of translating to how much gigawatts of data center can we support and other specific assumptions behind our guidance?

C.C. Wei
Chairman & CEO

Bruce, you got me. I mean that's -- I also try to understand what is the tokens of growth. But my customers, their product improvement continue to increase. So from -- it's a well-known from Hopper to Blackwell to Rubin, that almost double, triple their performance. So the one they can support the tokens of growth or the one they can continue to support the compute power is enormous.

And so I lose the track to be frank with you. And for gigawatt, I want to see that how much of TSMC can make the money from the gigawatt rather than say that how much we can support. Today, from my point of view, still the bottleneck is TSMC's wafer supply. Not the power consumption, not yet. So we also look at carefully. To answer your question, say that TSMC's wafer can support how much of the gigawatt, still not enough. They still have abundant of power supply in the U.S.

Zheng Lu
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. My next question is for the CapEx, right? I want to double check with what I just heard that C.C. was talking about like 2027, the CapEx will be more for the productivity improvement and '28, '29 may be meaningfully higher. So I do recall that in 2021, TSMC provided at 3 years for $100 billion CapEx to support that structural growth. Now the demand is even stronger. Based of that, can we do 3 years $200 billion of CapEx for the next 3 years. The math sounds doable.

Jeff Su
Director of Investor Relations

Okay. So well, first, a clarification because C.C. was talking about this year, we have substantially stepping up our CapEx investment, but C.C. also mentioned it takes 2 to 3 years to build capacity. So in terms of -- Bruce's question, do we say 2027 significant step up in CapEx, I think we're saying it takes time to -- for that capacity to come out. So that's the first part.

Yes. I think Bruce, what C.C. said was the productivity was our main focus in '26 and '27 because when we start to invest the fab, the volume production will not come out until '28 and '29. So the dollar amount invested today is for 2 years or even in the future. And CapEx dollar amount, as I said, in the last 3 years, $101 billion in the next 3 years, significantly higher. I'm not going to share with you the number, but significantly higher.
