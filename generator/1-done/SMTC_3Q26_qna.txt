Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer & Company.

Richard Schafer
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Congrats to you guys. My first question, I guess, is really on CopperEdge. It sounds like it's ramping with your lead CSP this quarter. And I'm just really curious sort of -- to me, that's breaking the ice. I mean does that -- how does that set you up with other CSPs next year? Basically, this validation from this lead customer speed deployments or wins with other CSPs? And is there any sense that you have today or maybe it's just too early to know, but any sense of how many ACC or CopperEdge customers you expect to ship to next year?

Hong Hou
President, CEO & Director

Rick, thank you very much for your questions. So, for the CopperEdge in ACC to supporting the leading hyperscalers, they have the product designed into 3 programs and then anticipate the ramp to start in the mid of 2026. But we supply our CopperEdge ICs to cable manufacturers, so they certainly need the product earlier than that. And we right now having all the things ready to go and based on the forecast they provided, so we need to make capacity available to support the very rapid ramp. And in our Q4, our revenue is just starting for that customer, but the substantial ramp is going to be throughout the fiscal year 2026.

As for -- you mentioned about, yes, this sort of icebreaking adoption. Definitely, we view this as a catalyst because of the benefits of the ACC over the competing technology is very obvious, especially in the power savings. And so, when we engage with the different hyperscalers, we sense that ACC is typically adopted in a platform design. So, certainly, now we see the broad-based awareness of this advantage and deployment by this hyperscaler certainly will provide a strong reference point for other hyperscalers to use in their future platform design. As for how many, we have been working with our cable partners and engaging pretty much with every hyperscalers out there. I do expect more design wins in the coming quarters.

Richard Schafer
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

And maybe for my follow-up, it's just a question I think we all get a lot and you do too, I'm sure, is just sort of how do you approach sizing the ACC opportunity? I mean, is a good proxy sort of the roughly $100 million DAC cable market? Or I guess, just sort of a starting point, some way to kind of size that market. And as part of your answer, I'd be curious just to understand better where -- we clearly see the benefits in terms of latency and power of ACC, but where -- like what kind of workloads or what kind of designs, where does ACC win versus AEC? Like where some of the lowest hanging fruit for Semtech there?

Hong Hou
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So, what we see, the ACC is positioned in a sweet spot between DAC, which had a signal limitation -- signal integrity limitation for transmitting over a longer distance at a high speed. Then AEC, which certainly can transmit with a longer distance, but with a significantly higher power consumption. So, certainly, if you look at the AEC plus DAC, it's a huge TAM. And ACC, as I said, is so uniquely positioned, we'll chip away a substantial portion of it as we start deploying hyperscalers. So, over time, we'll have a better idea how do we quantify the opportunity in the future.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Sean O'Loughlin with TD Cowen and Company.

Sean O'Loughlin
TD Cowen, Research Division

Congrats on the solid results here. You mentioned -- Hong, you mentioned Q4 growth in data center. I think you used the word meaningful contribution from LPO in the quarter. Maybe you could just either talk about that deployment specifically or if you can't get into any details onto that deployment, but in general, how do you envision LPO coming to the market? Is it sort of like on the ACC side where it's very project specific and therefore, kind of concentrated and lumpy? Or do you sort of envision it to fold into the mix over time like a CPU server chip of all would have been into the new generations?

Hong Hou
President, CEO & Director

Sean, thank you for the question. So, we see a strong sequential growth opportunity in Q4 for our data center business. As we mentioned, we anticipate approximately 10% quarter-over-quarter growth. That's on top of 8% sequential growth from Q2 to Q3. And the majority of the growth is going to be on the FiberEdge product.

In LPO, we are gaining more hyperscaler design wins. We anticipate a meaningful contribution for LPO for Q4. If I have to say meaningful mid-single-digit level. And ACC contribution of Q4 is still going to be very nominal. As I mentioned early on, that the hyperscaler ramp in volume and their racks for the interconnect is going to be starting in the mid of 2026, will probably be 3 to 4 months prior to that, getting the ramp going to supply to cable manufacturers to get the ACCs ready.

Sean O'Loughlin
TD Cowen, Research Division

Great. And then I just had a quick question for Mark. On the gross margin side in Q4, understood on the mix shift within IoT. I guess sort of 2 questions around that. Is this sort of a permanent mix shift that you're anticipating? Or is this just sort of a temporary -- LoRa was strong in Q3, going to dip a little bit in Q4, and so that will balance out longer term.

And then, well I guess maybe this part is -- I don't know if this is a [ soft ] question or a Mark question, but one of the suppliers on the foundry side in your space talked about some significant CapEx that they were anticipating on the silicon photonics, but especially the silicon germanium side. And just wondering if you anticipate any sort of headwinds on that side as you mentioned, the entire market goes through a bit of a capacity constrained environment here?

Mark Lin
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks for the question, Sean. Let me try to address gross margin first and clarify there. On the positive side, semiconductor gross margins driven by data center and LoRa was 61.4% in Q3, up 140 basis points year-over-year, up 60 basis points quarter-over-quarter.

SIP gross margin, Signal Integrity Products, which encompasses data center, it was -- the gross margin for Q3 was 65.1%, up 270 basis points quarter-over-quarter -- 200 basis points year-over-year. And the reason I'm providing these statistics is we have -- what we've delineated as our core portfolio of data center, LoRa and PerSe, those are our faster-growing markets. And those gross margins, hopefully, you can see are above the corporate gross margin averages.

So as those businesses, we believe, will continue to ramp, we believe they'll be accretive to gross margins. On the IoT systems and connectivity side, we mentioned that we're going to have growth in cellular modules, where gross margin is less than 1/3 of our semiconductor products. And we also have nominally lower sales from LoRa.

In terms of where that's heading, we've talked about what's in our core portfolio and what is not in our core portfolio. I think from what Hong mentioned, one of the top priorities is, we're looking at portfolio rationalization there, partially to remove that margin disparity.

On your question on foundry...

Hong Hou
President, CEO & Director

Maybe I can answer that one. Yes, Sean, you are right. The silicon germanium technology platform right now is widely used in the making of physical media devices, the TIAs and drivers, but also in silicon photonics. That is why my first priority over the next few months is to make capacity available. That foundry is our close partners. We have long-standing relationship over the last 1.5 decades, and they have been providing excellent support to us.

Another nuance related to the component availability is a co-planning process with our customers and with our customers' customers sometimes. And that is a process we have implemented a few quarters ago and has been working extremely well. So even they share their visibility even in the business development stage. And we -- based on the understanding and based on our triangulation, we have the wafer start in the fab. And typically, the lead time is 6 months plus/minus. But with the planning process, we gained the visibility, we can start earlier, and we have never really let our customers down with our key components.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.

Harsh Kumar
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Hong, on last call, I think I was giving you a little bit of a hard time on lack of sequential growth in the data center business. And I think suffice to say, you fixed that going forward. But I did have a question on that. My question is, LPO seems to be a little bit earlier than ACC, and it seems to be coming on. You're excited about it. But almost everybody I know struggles with the scope and size of that market. So, maybe if I can ask you again or not again, but if I can ask you to just help us understand how big can LPO be as a business? And maybe what is your positioning in the LPO business? And then as a follow-up on the ACC side, I wanted to ask you, for ACC, are you seeing applications that replace ACC -- I'm sorry, AEC or just brand-new applications?

Hong Hou
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thank you, Harsh. So, first of all, on the data center growth, yes. So, we're seeing very strong momentum and the booking and outlook and forecast is very strong throughout the 2026. And the LPO is -- we're pretty excited about the first meaningful ramp in our Q4. And as I mentioned before, the LPO give us an incremental opportunity to bring more content in the transceivers. So we benefit from a strong backdrop of the transceiver demand with the retimed solutions where we provide market-leading TIAs.

By offering LPO, we have opportunities to offer drivers in addition to TIAs. So that will increase our TAM by 150%. So, we certainly welcome that transition. And definitely, the rollout of LPO will cannibalize the DSP-based solutions, but we'll do it any day with the increased TAM. ACC, on the other hand, is a net gain. So, right now, with the air pocket we're experiencing from the early adoption in the rack interconnects, the ramp with the hyperscalers is going to be giving us an acceleration of data center revenue.

The adoption dynamics for LPO and ACC is a little different. LPO tend to be gradual because in their switch fabric, they can -- as soon as they -- as long as they have the confidence in the signal integrity on the host they plug into, they can use LPO. ACC, on the other hand, is more the platform-based when they design the new rack platform, and they will have the power consumption envelope and ACC provides 90% of power saving compared to AEC. That is a huge amount.

When you look at the rack design right now, any rack, they probably have anywhere from 100 to 200 cables inside. So, each connector -- each cable have 2 connectors on each end, it can translate into significant power savings. So, ACC is encroaching into the established AEC market, but also the [ ACE ] market. And because they're short, connects are predominantly DAC-based. But with the ACC availability, especially for 200 gigabit per lane and ACC is expected to be mainstream for longer than meter reach in the future.

Harsh Kumar
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Understood. Very helpful as always. And my next question was the force sensing acquisition. I don't know much about it. Maybe you could tell us just really quickly, given this is an earnings call, just really quickly, what the product does and how you intend to use it? And how much revenue and kind of OpEx you had because OpEx jumped up quite a bit.

Hong Hou
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So the force sensing is a capability you need to touch it and to activate it. We have the capacitive sensing that basically when you have your human body close to the sensors, you change the dielectric constant, you can activate the sensing. But with the force sensing, you need to apply the force to activate it. It combines with capacitive sensing very nicely to offer broader capabilities for smart wearables and computing and automotive platforms.

The asset we acquired from Qorvo was originally as a company called NextInput, they were founded in 2012 and about 4.5 years ago, it was acquired by Qorvo. And the technology is very differentiating. They have over 175 patents issued under applications. When we were looking at how to grow the core asset and how do we fill the gaps in capabilities, the force sensing was on our road map. And just optimistically, we found this asset available. So we got them acquired and get them nicely integrated.

The acquisition happened slightly less than a month ago. But as I mentioned, the integration already been very successful. So we made the first shipment of the product with our fulfillment infrastructure last week. As for the incremental R&D increase, it's still a lot better to buy this asset than otherwise internally investing. And so it's largely a technology tuck-in. The revenue contribution at this point is immaterial, but we do project a very healthy synergy and a very healthy contribution of this technology and asset to our future revenue.

Mark Lin
Executive VP & CFO

And Harsh, just to double-click on OpEx. While there is incremental OpEx from our sensing portfolio, including this force sensing product, we're also increasing R&D in data center. So the areas where we're investing, the core areas and these core assets isn't changing. And we've been able to deliver some pretty good returns in data center, LoRa and sensing with some nominal increases in OpEx. We expect to be doing the same in Q4.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna International Group.

Christopher Rolland
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Congrats on the results. I guess, first, a clarification and then a question. The first clarification is you talked about a customer integrating linear equalizers on PCB in the coming quarters. If you could talk a little bit about that. Is that a high-volume win or more of a test case? And then just a clarification, you said that you're ramping LPO with several leading U.S. hyperscalers. Are those the same 2 that you were talking about last quarter? Or are there additional for LPO?

Hong Hou
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thank you, Chris, for the questions. First, on the customers are evaluating the linear equalizer in the PCBs or connectors. Those are for the high-volume applications for the high-speed traces and some customers are planning to do it in the PCBs. And some other customers are seeing the marginal loss of signal integrity from the host, from the ASIC to the port. So they are evaluating to use the linear equalizer to bridge the signal integrity. And it's pretty exciting. So it is pretty broad-based and more than 3, 4 customers on those type of applications.

As for the LPOs, we stopped counting how many hyperscalers are planning to use it. I would say, at this point, the conversation almost same when I was talking to the teams and when I was engaging with our customers doing the optical modules, the CIOE in Shenzhen and ECOC in Copenhagen, and we were joking, it's more like who are not planning of using LPO and why? So I would say this technology at this point is not if, but more like when and what platform they're going to be using it. And we're really excited about the Q4 mark the starting point of the ramp, but we do expect acceleration throughout 2026.

Christopher Rolland
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

That's fantastic, Hong. And then secondly, I'll leave it up to you at dealer's choice, either PON in China and when we should get confirmed tenders and what you're hearing there or LoRa kind of your outlook there? It seems like this Gen 4 has some new use cases, which is pretty cool. You can answer either or both.

Hong Hou
President, CEO & Director

LoRa, one question on LoRa. So yes, Gen 4 is gaining tremendous momentum and the multi-protocol is really very exciting. So we plan to provide SDK and software stack to enable Wi-SUN first and to enable a security application combined with LoRaWAN.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri with UBS.

Timothy Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Hong, your tone on divestiture has definitely changed versus what it was 3 or so months ago. It was sort of put on hold a little bit. And now it sounds like you have another adviser, and you have some folks who are interested. And so can you just -- like what changed? And was it you weren't getting the price you wanted and now these buyers are more interested in engaging at a price that you're happy with? What -- can you just walk through like the evolution of what sort of changed there? And maybe how close are you to -- do you think executing something?

Hong Hou
President, CEO & Director

Thank you for the question, Tim. So the simple answer is nothing has changed. So this time around, we definitely have more dedicated mind share from the potential acquirers and because the geopolitical situation is a little bit more settled and also they're seeing some of the tailwinds playing into the reality into the new business opportunities, the backlog and also we projected Q4 sequential growth. So to the right acquirers, this really representing a pretty significant synergistic value to them. And as for the timing, we really cannot predict, but rest assured, this is my top priority.

Timothy Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. And then just on the rack. So it sounds -- I mean, you're kind of -- it sounds like you're semi-promising Kyber in 2027. And I just want to make sure, do you have a lot of visibility on that, just given what happened this year with the Blackwell racks. I just want to talk through how much confidence that you actually have on that, that you would be ramping on Kyber in '27 because it does sound like you're kind of semi-promising that.

Hong Hou
President, CEO & Director

Tim, I would shy away from the specific platform, but go back to the fundamentals. So there's really not a whole a lot of different ways to improve the signal integrity, especially when you get the high-speed signal launched into very thin metal trees. So you're going to lose the signal strength, you're going to distort the signal, and you need to condition it, and there is no better or more seamless way than getting linear equalizer integrated on the board. If they have other ways to do it, they would do it as well. So that's the fundamental belief and we have -- and that's the use cases we're seeing with multiple customers who are interested in incorporating linear equalizer on PCBs.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel.

Tore Svanberg
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Hong, my first question is on ACC. You mentioned the 3 programs there with the lead customer ramping in '26. I know you can't talk about specifics, but could you at least confirm that all 3 programs are either cable or PCB board? And are they all based on the same speeds? And if so, what are the speeds?

Hong Hou
President, CEO & Director

Tore, thank you for the question. All 3 programs are for 200 gigabit per second trace, and they are all in the cable forms, these 3 programs, none of them are the chip on board.

Tore Svanberg
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. And as my follow-up and sort of back to the Sierra Wireless gross margins. They've been under quite a bit of pressure. I mean I understand the mix of modules versus services and so on and so forth. But we're also hearing about component costs going up, whether it's memory or modem chips or anything like that. So how should we think about that gross margin, not just next quarter, but over the next few quarters?

Hong Hou
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So Mark, do you want to...

Mark Lin
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So on the gross margin for the ISC business, so you mentioned memory. Maybe I'll just get to the point in terms of, let's say, inflationary costs on the BOM, we're not experiencing that, especially in memory. We have a few choices there in terms of suppliers. So there -- for ISC, it really is mix. That's the primary driver of gross margins. As we -- as cellular modules is a higher percentage, the gross margin goes down. And if we have more in terms of services or router business, the gross margin in that business goes up. But at this point, as we're guiding next quarter, we're seeing really, really strong orders and expectations for customer delivery ramps into Q4.

Tore Svanberg
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

So Mark, so this is basically 5G modules that are ramping this quarter and because they're lower margin than services and software, that's basically what's weighing on it.

Mark Lin
Executive VP & CFO

That's right. But it's both 4G and 5G. But of course, 5G is definitely a tailwind, correct.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company.

Quinn Bolton
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to follow-up on that last question. Just, Mark, maybe you can level set us. I think you said the semiconductor gross margin for the fourth quarter would be 60.5%. I don't know if you gave an ISC gross margin, but it looks like it's got to be pretty materially below the 36.6% that you did in the third quarter. So just wondering if you could give us some range where you think that ISC gross margin comes out in the fourth quarter?

Mark Lin
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. At this point, I'll just say that the ISC gross margin is -- will be lower, primarily due to the drivers we talked about with cellular modules. On the -- but again, on the positive side, semiconductor gross margins was 60.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. So still quite healthy, and we expect that to continue to grow. Well, we're only guiding on 1 quarter, right? The drivers of gross margin between data center, LoRa and per se, our sensing business now is expected to be accretive to that gross margin.

Quinn Bolton
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then I'm not sure if it's for Mark or Hong. It does sound like you may be getting closer to a potential divestiture based on your comments in the script. I think in the past, you described a divestiture of noncore assets as being non-dilutive to EPS because you would take deal proceeds and pay down high interest rate term loan debt. Well, you've now done that interest expense annually is less than $3 million. So I guess I'm hoping you could comment now without the balance sheet, would a divestiture of noncore assets be dilutive to EPS?

Mark Lin
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. At this point, we're looking at the lower gross margin portions of our business. So that would be something that -- at this point, without naming all the specific assets that we're looking at, let's say it's a nominal impact to immaterial impact.

Operator

And our final question comes from the line of Cody Acree with The Benchmark Company.

Cody Grant Acree
The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division

Hong, if we can maybe go back to the ACC opportunity for a minute. Can you talk to some of the market's concerns around reliability of ACC and earlier testing? Is that contributing to any of the hyperscaler what looks like to be maybe incremental delays in the program ramp that I believe was expected to begin here in Q4 and now looks like it's more into next year.

Hong Hou
President, CEO & Director

Cody, yes, thanks for the question. I'm not aware of any reliability you were mentioning about the ACC. So there are some chattering like this is more like a couple of years ago by not really -- the player is no longer active in the industry, and there's some false start. But there are no -- any issue we are aware of, and we have deployed a significant amount of ACCs in the industry. So I mean, we haven't heard anything bad. And then with the hyperscalers, they have gone through months of qualification and reliability testing, system validation process. They're very careful and they're very technically capable. We haven't heard anything -- any concern about that.

Cody Grant Acree
The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division

All right. Great. Can we go back to your discussion of ensuring capacity availability? Can you just talk about some of the strategies that you might be able to employ specifically on the wafer side that you mentioned earlier?

Hong Hou
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So we talk about silicon photonics, silicon germanium semiconductor platform to support silicon photonics and also our PMD physical media devices. And there are more than 1 fab, one location, and we try to make more capacity available by engaging and qualifying manufacturing from other sites in other countries. So that not only unlock some additional capacities, but also make it more robust from the geopolitical point of view. So that's what I mean. That's the focus for the near term.

Cody Grant Acree
The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division

Would you look at anything like dedicated capacity commitment or investment on your part?

Hong Hou
President, CEO & Director

So the capacity, certainly, we have been increasing the CapEx investment in the back end, for example, testing. And -- but for the foundry capacity, we are primarily working with our partners to qualify their foundry from different locations.

Operator

Thank you. And with that, there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mitch Haws for closing remarks.

Mitchell Haws
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

That concludes today's call. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you at various investor events over the coming weeks.

Operator

Thank you, Mitch. And with that, this does conclude today's teleconference.
