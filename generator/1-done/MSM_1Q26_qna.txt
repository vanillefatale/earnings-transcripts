[Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is from Ryan Merkel with William Blair.

Ryan Merkel
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

My first question is just on price, and I guess it's a 2-parter. So the 4% price, I think that was a little bit more than you expected. Could you just unpack what drove that? And then how should we think about price in fiscal 2Q? Do you think you'll see more price?

Ryan Mills
Head of Investor Relations

Ryan, this is Ryan. I'll talk about the 1Q price, and then I'll pass it over to Martina to talk about our expectations for 2Q. No, price came in kind of how we're expecting it. If you recall, we took a price action in June -- late June, and we had some carryover from that. And then we took another price action in late September, early October to address the price cost issues towards the end of fiscal 4Q. So you net it all together, price came in as expected.

And then, Martina, if you want to give some color on...

Martina McIsaac
President, CEO & Director

Ryan, thank you. So we're still seeing inflation, not the intense pace that we saw in July and August, but we're still taking pockets of inflation across the business. The strongest is seen on the metalworking side, and I think that's not a surprise for anybody who's kept track of what's happening with tungsten. So just to ground everybody, tungsten is a major input into carbide cutting tools. And we have -- and it supplies controlled by China, and we've seen price increases now that exceed 100% on tungsten. So we are taking mid- to high single-digit price increases from our metalworking suppliers, and we will pass that on starting in mid-January.

To give you a little bit of a flavor on our exposure with tungsten, it impacts about 15% of our sales. So I'll walk you through that. Metalworking is about 50% of our total sales. Within metalworking, cutting tools is a big category, not the only category, right? We have abrasives and machinery and accessories and fluids. There are other large categories as well, but cutting tools is a major category within metalworking. And then carbide cutting tools is a majority -- it's not an overwhelming majority, but it's about half of our cutting tool business. We also have high-speed steel and cobalt and other things in there, too.

So our exposure is about 15%. We'll take the first price increase in January. I don't think we're done. So I think there will be more inflation passed to us on that, and we're in conversations with our suppliers. So we may see another action needed later on in '26.

Ryan Mills
Head of Investor Relations

And then, Ryan, if you take the carryover from the late September, early October pricing actions and then what Martina alluded to in the mid-January, late January price increases, it wouldn't be a surprise if price 2Q was a little north of 5% year-over-year and around 1.4% quarter-over-quarter, just to give you a little bit of an idea.

Ryan Merkel
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Got it. Okay. Super helpful. And then my second question is on the topic of IEEPA, and we're going to get a ruling Friday. It seems this may be hard to answer. But can you share any thoughts on the impact if IEEPA tariffs are ruled invalid?

Ryan Mills
Head of Investor Relations

Yes. So we'll get the benefit from lower inventories working through the P&L. And then, of course, if the market adjusts price, we would, too. So it's kind of the opposite of how price cost rolls through our average inventory accounting method. So I'd say we'd probably take a hit initially, and then we'd get a benefit as we work through the inventory and start to receive that lower cost inventory. So that's the way I think about it, Ryan.

Your next question is from Ken Newman with KeyBanc.

Kenneth Newman
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

So maybe for my first question here, Martina, I just wanted to run through that comment around -- I mean, you guys certainly kind of hammered this idea of, call it, 20% incremental margins in a mid-single-digit environment. When I run through the historical seasonality against the midpoint of that 2Q guide, it does imply the back half is growing something a little closer to low to mid-single digits.

I just wanted to give you the chance to maybe clarify the intent behind that mid-single-digit comment and the opportunity to help us understand maybe the pockets of opportunity for better operating leverage in the back half versus typical seasonality?

Ryan Mills
Head of Investor Relations

Yes. Ken, this is Ryan. I'll give you a little bit of color and then pass it over to Martina. You're right, if you run at that seasonality, it would imply low to mid-single digits. But if you look at the annual outlook slide in the commentary due to price and continued momentum in our initiatives, we wouldn't be surprised if we outperformed historical seasonal trends quarter-over-quarter in the back half. And then when we think about the productivity front, that will continue to grow, and we expect incrementals to be a little bit stronger in the back half. And just to give you a little bit of color on the confidence there.

If you look at the midpoint of our outlook for 2Q, incremental margin around 18%. We talked about some increasing costs related to the supplier conference around travel and other costs. We view that as an opportunity to partner with our suppliers. We didn't feel it was the right thing to do to make them pay for that. If you back that out, it's about $1 million. Incrementals are closer to 20% on what was a challenging December in the quarter. So that gives us confidence in incrementals as we move through the rest of the fiscal year.

And then Martina, I don't know if there's anything you want to add.

Martina McIsaac
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean I think we're confident in our growth -- in the momentum in our growth initiatives. So we expect to be decoupling from our trend. Everything that we're doing is around sales execution and share capture. I think we have the right structure in place now, and now we turn to accelerated execution in the field. And what we're seeing is encouraging. So we're not declaring victory, but we do expect that higher pace of growth, particularly in our Core Customer.

And then as I said, we're on track with a productivity program that we started a couple of years ago in terms of our network optimization and optimizing the way we spend all of our big drivers of costs, right, where we spend freight dollars, how we optimize within our 4 walls. And so we're seeing the trajectory there, and it makes us pretty confident.

Ryan Mills
Head of Investor Relations

And Ken, the other thing I'd add too is the Core Customer has been growing for 2-plus quarters. The MBI still signals contraction. And then if you look in the offsets, this is the second quarter that manufacturing daily sales outpaced price. So that's giving us encouragement too, that the initiatives in place are working.

Kenneth Newman
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's really helpful color. Maybe just for my follow-up here, I'm curious if there's a way to quantify how you think about the net margin impact from the Public Sector sales implied in the second quarter. I know that's -- I think you mentioned it's resuming back to growth after the shutdown headwinds last quarter, but it's still against a pretty tough comp. I think that's a lower mix portion of the business. And just how do you think about that maybe normalizing out mix-wise in the back half of this year?

Ryan Mills
Head of Investor Relations

Yes. So in the Public Sector, what we said is due to the headwinds in the first quarter from the shutdown, quarter-over-quarter mix headwind will be about roughly 50 basis points. We don't expect to see a strong ramp in the Public Sector. We expect it to go back more to business as usual. And I would assume that to be the case in the back half of the fiscal year. That's how I would think about it, Ken. And then keep in mind that our outlook assumes for 2Q assumes that there is not another federal government shutdown. I just wanted to throw that out there as well.

Your next question is from Tommy Moll with Stephens Inc.

Thomas Moll
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Martina, in your prepared comments, you talked about some cost measures taken in early 2Q, and it was in the same breath as I mentioned, on turning your attention to the service model. So I guess it's a 2-part question here on the cost measures. What can you share there in terms of details, perhaps sizing or context? And was that meant to be linked to your comments around service? Or were they more aimed at the selling organization?

Martina McIsaac
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks for the question. Yes. So our whole sales optimization program has sort of been pointed at our strategic goals of accelerating organic growth and optimizing our cost to serve. And that's what I've been talking about for the past year, and we focus primarily through those efforts on our core selling role. So we optimize geographies, we balance portfolios. And like I said, we believe that we're starting to see the impact of that, right? Growth comes from more coverage and a better customer experience and cost to serve comes from an efficient resource deployment.

So that work we have completed. But as you can imagine, there's a lot of other customer-facing roles in the business. So if you think about our Core Customer, you're talking about anyone from a small metalworking shop with 20 people up to a complex multisite business. And we have a lot of teams that support that business, so both in business acquisition and then in terms of service once we have customers enrolled in different programs. And so we had not touched that side of the business.

And so what we have done over the past 1.5 quarters is apply those principles to our service org to basically marry it up with what we've done in sales. And again, the goal is match the right amount of resource to the right potential. So we completed that work right at the end of the first quarter. And then at the beginning of 2Q, we did have a headcount benefit as a result of that optimization. So I don't -- I won't share a lot more details for competitive reasons, but we think we have the right structure in place now.

Ryan Mills
Head of Investor Relations

And then, Tommy, just to size it, the way I would think about it is the headcount actions Martina alluded to early on in fiscal 2Q and further productivity, eating away a large chunk of that $4 million quarter-over-quarter headwind from 2 extra months of merit.

Thomas Moll
Stephens Inc., Research Division

And then just sticking on the theme of profitability here. You gave helpful guidance on fiscal second quarter in terms of gross margin and OpEx. Any comments you want to offer now on seasonality for either gross margin percentage or OpEx? I mean, I guess the starting assumption might be gross margin percentage flat, maybe even a little bit improved as price/cost improves post Q2 and on OpEx. I mean, unless you would point anything out, I think the starting assumption there would just be model normal variable expense associated with the sales commission as volumes fluctuate. But any additional context would be helpful.

Ryan Mills
Head of Investor Relations

Yes, Tommy, good question. The way I think about it, starting with 2Q, we have -- I'll start with gross margin. Starting with 2Q, the outlook, 40.8% plus or minus 20 basis points with 1 month under our belt and what we see looking forward in the next 2 months, it doesn't feel like a tough hurdle to be at the upper end of that range. As you go through the remainder of the year, that's going to be dependent on Core Customer acceleration and further inflation working through the P&L if we see more supplier price increases. So as a ballpark, I'd probably stay at that 40.8% plus or minus 20 basis points with some potential upside in the back half.

As we think about OpEx, to your point, I think it's a good idea to take the variable OpEx associated with the sales growth. But then the other thing to keep in mind, too, is we expect productivity to improve throughout the year. So what I'm alluding at is we have a 20% incremental margin target for the year. 18% in 1Q. At the midpoint of 2Q, we're at 18%. So that would imply some stronger incremental margins in the back half. And what we have line of sight to, we feel pretty comfortable on that.

Your next question for today is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.

Nigel Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Martina, congratulations on the new role. Just want to go back to December. Just I understand the holiday timing and the impact on the customer shutdowns. But any more color on why it's so extreme, just given it was a 1-day shift from last year from Wednesday to Thursday. So just wondering if there's any more kind of color in terms of why customers decided to shut down over that period? And then have you seen sort of normal operations resuming in January so far?

Ryan Mills
Head of Investor Relations

Yes, Nigel, good question. The dynamics with December, first off, it wasn't a surprise with the holidays falling on a Thursday and keep in mind, our fiscal December runs through January 3, so we also had the impact from New Year's. The reason Thursday being the worst is customers take off Friday, too, for a long weekend.

Just to give you an idea, the last time the holidays fell on a Thursday was back in 2014. December was down 16% month-over-month. We're down 20% roughly month-over-month. And then going back to the prepared remarks, December on through the rest of the fiscal month, we were down 20%. So we really got hit hard in the back half of the month. Looking out to January, visibility is still limited. I mean we have 2 days under our belt. But going back to what Martina said on our growth initiatives, the fact that core continued to grow in that challenging December and was our top grower, we expect that trend to continue. So regardless of macro conditions, we feel like there's opportunity to take share, particularly within that Core Customer.

Martina, I don't know if there's anything.

Martina McIsaac
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think, Nigel, the important thing that we always call out is that January 2 day or the last Friday actually falls into our quarter. It will fall into everyone else's January because of our fiscal calendar, and that represented a headwind alone of about 100 basis points on growth. And coming into Christmas, we were actually seeing trends that made us encouraged and positive. So core is still outperforming. We believe we're still taking share. So it was a disappointing number, obviously, for December, but as Ryan said, expected because of where the holidays fell.

Nigel Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

No, that's great color. And January 3 definitely hurts you a bit more. The -- just a quick follow- on gross margins. You provided some really good color there. Obviously, you've got some pretty aggressive price increases coming through in January. I'm just wondering, have you included the benefits from those price increases in your 2Q guide? I know it's in your portion of that price increase, but would that be in your 2Q guide? And do you anticipate maintaining gross margins on both the price and cost inflation?

Ryan Mills
Head of Investor Relations

Yes. Yes. So I'll give a little color on 2Q, and then maybe I'll pass it all over to Greg to talk about price cost and gross margin in 1Q. Contemplated in our outlook is the price increase that we have for mid-January. We're not going to speculate on future pricing from our suppliers for the remainder of the quarter of the year. But our goal is to maintain price/cost neutrality. And like I said earlier, see some upside to the range for 2Q, the upper half of the range and 40.8% plus or minus 20 basis points for the back half of the year sounds like a good ballpark with some potential upside.

And then, Greg, I don't know if you wanted to touch on how gross margin trended through 1Q.

Gregory Clark
VP & Interim CFO

Yes. Thanks, Ryan. Taking a look at -- just looking at gross margin, I talk quarter-over-quarter, sequentially, with positive price cost and Public Sector-driven mix were the biggest drivers of the 30 basis point improvement that we saw during the quarter. These benefits were slightly offset by some adjustments that didn't go our way during the quarter. Just looking at price/cost in general. At the beginning of the quarter, we saw price/cost was negative and similar to 4Q levels. However, following our price actions in late September, early October, we did start to see price/cost improve and exited the quarter in a much better position, which led to the 40.8% plus or minus 20 bps guide for Q2.

Your next question for today is from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan.

Patrick Baumann
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I just want to dive back into Nigel's question on December cadence. So you said that I think from Christmas through the end of your fiscal month, it was down 20%. And I'm guessing like sales trends at that time of year are the greatest anyway on a daily basis. So curious up until Christmas, what was the ADS growth versus that 2.5% you did for the month?

Ryan Mills
Head of Investor Relations

Yes. Just if you do the math, Pat, it's about 4% to 5%-ish roughly.

Patrick Baumann
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then when you're thinking about the first quarter and the January, February number being 3% above that at the midpoint of the second quarter number, can you talk about the thinking behind that? I guess, you mentioned price, but just curious how that 3% compares to history? And then with limited visibility that you have, why you think that's kind of a reasonable place to be?

Ryan Mills
Head of Investor Relations

Yes. Good question, Pat. To your point, January and February at the midpoint, up roughly 3%. That's combined January and February ADS up 3% versus 1Q. Historically, that's roughly 2%. Digging a little bit deeper, for the quarter, we talked about a 50 basis point benefit to ADS from the federal government shutdown headwinds in 1Q. We already picked up a little bit of that in December. Public Sector was up mid- to high single digits sequentially December versus November.

So what I'm getting at there is maybe for January and February, that looks more like 35, 40 basis points. And then we talked about a 50 basis point headwind from the timing of our supplier conference. That's in the last week of February. We said 50 basis points, but if you isolate it for that 2 months, it looks more like 75 basis points. So we're in the whole of 30 basis points roughly on -- when you add those 2 together, what's given us confidence is the price action in mid-January that will go into effect and also the continued acceleration we see in Core Customers and National Accounts as well. As we mentioned, December, despite a challenging December, core was still up mid-single digits. We feel confident that, that could continue.

Patrick Baumann
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And then maybe one for Martina. I guess, the supplier event that you're hosting this year, what are you hoping to accomplish from it? You're bringing 1,400 associates to it and a bunch of suppliers. The volume growth that the company is delivering is still versus industrial production, not exciting. Can you talk about how you get that to improve and maybe if this event is meant to help start to drive that?

Martina McIsaac
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks for the question. So since I've been at MSC, one of the things that I really focused on is rebuilding trust with our suppliers and strengthening those relationships. And we've done a lot of things in the background that we haven't talked about with you around making ourselves easier to do business with and increasing our supplier transparency. But one of the things that we did that was really important was to put the supplier council together because we talk straight about how to improve MSC's growth and how supplier collaboration with MSC can help us continue to outperform.

So they actually designed what an ideal session would look like. And this is not a trade show. This is a working session, very detailed joint business planning that was designed by suppliers to be different from what they do in the industry today. And we do exactly, as you say, expect to come out of that with an engagement plan in the field that will be followed up and executed on and will be a growth accelerator.

So it's a huge undertaking. It's a lot of upfront data-driven prep. It is a lot of people, as you said, but I think it's one way to make a big bang post all of these structural changes to aggressively go after growth in partnership with suppliers. So we're really excited about it, and we think it's worth the effort of taking all those folks out of the field for a few days. But as Ryan said, it will shift some revenue then into the third quarter.

Your next question is from Chris Dankert with Loop Capital.

Christopher Dankert
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

I guess just to poke at the 2Q guide a little bit more here. So if we're expecting price to be up 5% or a little bit north of that in the second quarter. Obviously, there's moving parts with supplier conference and whatnot. But volumes here are implied to still be flat to down a bit. Can you kind of put that in context? Is that just being cautious given the macro backdrop? Are we expecting to get positive in the back half of the year? Maybe like how do we get that core volume back up? And how does that compare with what is the demand on the ground here?

Ryan Mills
Head of Investor Relations

Yes, Chris. So if you look at it at a year-over-year basis, keep in mind the challenging December. January and February applies roughly up 5.5% year-over-year. We said I wouldn't be surprised if price was a little north of 50 basis points. I mean, a little north of 5% year-over-year. So maybe a little bit of volume improvement. Going to the supplier conference, I would say we were probably a little conservative on the potential impact. That's 3 days in the last week, 1,400 customer-facing individuals at MSC being out. It could be less, it could be more. And given the fact that we don't have a lot of visibility here into the new calendar year, I would say we're a little bit cautious with our outlook and what we're implying with January and February.

Christopher Dankert
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

That's helpful context. And then maybe just as we think about growth drivers, I've noticed the In-Plant sales growth is great, but the signings have tapered a little bit here. Are we more focused on the core and kind of letting the In-Plant kind of bubble up more organically? Has that been deemphasized? Is it just timing and I'm overlooking into this? Just any context on In-Plant growth there?

Martina McIsaac
President, CEO & Director

Yes, I'm so glad you asked because no, we still have focus on our largest customers. We have an incredible team engagement -- team customer engagement concept that we call MRO Go that build programs for customers, and that includes placing implants if that's the appropriate part of the solution. And that's aimed at the top end of our customer segment, so our largest, most complex customers, National Accounts, and that is still ongoing.

I think what you saw in the conversion in the first quarter, you saw the net number sort of continue to grow, but grow a little bit more slowly. And that's because at the same time that we are fully engaged in opening new programs for suppliers, we're also very engaged on challenging our own cost structure, looking at the drivers of profitability and building that financial acumen in the field. So not every customer needs an In-Plant. We can provide outstanding service through a number of our service teams in a number of different models. And if a customer's needs are simpler, then the better thing to do is to allow that service to be provided in a simpler way.

So we actually stepped down off a couple of existing In-Plant programs in cooperation with the customer as part of our cost savings program that we put in place for them and offered a different solution. So we'll continue to examine those going forward, but absolutely no slowdown in the pipeline, absolutely no shift in emphasis. The teams that are working with those largest customers are still intact and in place.

Ryan Mills
Head of Investor Relations

So Chris, I would also add that the sequential growth you saw in the number of In-Plant programs, what Martina is getting at is the signings were greater than that increase.

Your final question for today is from David Manthey with Baird.

David Manthey
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

My question, too, is on the first quarter to second quarter sequentials. If I'm calculating this right, if you go to, say, a 6% ADS in the second quarter, theoretically, that would still be a sequential of like minus 4%, and you're saying the minus 2% is the historical average. And if you go to that 5.5% or 6%, I guess you'd be sort of factoring out the holidays and sales meeting and all that stuff. So -- and then on top of that, you get better government sales, you get this pricing acceleration.

I'm just -- what I'm getting at is unless market demand is deteriorating, why wouldn't you be seeing more normal sequential trends in the second quarter versus what was already a seemingly weak first quarter? And then why wouldn't those be more normal or even higher as we move through the year if the economy gets better?

Ryan Mills
Head of Investor Relations

Yes. Dave, we tried messaging this at the fireside chats at recent conferences and following up with investors and the sell side. Look, December wasn't a surprise. Thursday is the worst day for the holidays to fall on. And if you look at the -- if you go back to the slides last quarter in the annual slide when we talked about assumptions for the quarters in the back half, what we said is the past 2 years, the average is down 4.5%. We're at 5% at the midpoint. Like we said, visibility is a little bit limited.

Going to your point about the Public Sector, yes, we'll get a little bit of a pickup there. But keep in mind that 2Q is a seasonal low for the Public Sector. And the expectation is it just going to go back to business as normal. So you're not going to recoup that 100 basis points in 2Q. So as we stand here today, you saw in the macro indicators, the PMI contracted new orders in the MBI contracted in December as well.

Visibility is limited. We feel good about what we're doing from a growth initiative standpoint, but not going to get ahead of our skis and feel like we're doing a good job on just giving what we currently view the market to be and our expectations. And then also keep in mind that the supplier conference, too, that's something that we alluded to as well with sales potentially getting pushed back out from 2Q to 3Q.

David Manthey
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Yes, I know there's a lot of moving parts. We'll have to work through that. And -- but additionally, if you're looking at incrementals sort of near term and even through the remainder of the year, here, too, if essentially you're talking about mid-single-digit price increases being essentially all of the growth in the near term and maybe a little bit less than that going forward, but a big chunk of the growth, with price predominantly driving your revenue growth with super high read-through on that, in addition to some of these cost reduction efforts, again, I'm not trying to push you on these numbers and get you outside your comfort zone, but why wouldn't contribution margins be higher than 20% if it's price plus cost reduction efforts, it would seem like you'd see abnormally high incrementals in that type of environment. What's the offset there that I'm missing?

Ryan Mills
Head of Investor Relations

So if you look at what we're implying for the quarter, 18% at the midpoint. Given the soft December is a 5-week month, there's a lot of fixed costs associated with that. You could imagine operating leverage was pretty challenged in December. That would imply January and February look a lot better from an incremental margin standpoint than what's representative of the average for the quarter.

And keep in mind, we have about $1 million in incremental expense related to travel for the supplier conference. And then you heard us say in the back half, we expect incremental margins to be better than the first half. And if we were to be in a mid- to high single-digit growth environment, to your point, Dave, we'd expect those incremental margins to be a lot stronger.
