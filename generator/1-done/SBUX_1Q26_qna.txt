[Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of David Tarantino with Baird.

David Tarantino
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Congratulations on the progress you're seeing. I had a question about the North America traffic performance. And maybe first, if you could perhaps clarify how much benefit you might have seen from the transfer of the sales from the stores that you closed during, I guess, late September. And then to just kind of give us some sense of kind of what the underlying improvement was in the business? And then secondly, I guess, Brian, could you maybe frame up what you're seeing in some of the earliest stores that got the Green Apron Service model and whether those are continuing to ramp in terms of the traffic benefit from that service model?

Brian Niccol
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, David. And so to answer your first question, what we're really delighted about is the North American comp result is driven by transactions and specifically, the fact that both non-rewards customers grew transactions and rewards customers grew transactions. So two things happened. People came back to the brand. And we also drove engagement or more frequency with our existing customers. So that's a really strong foundation. To answer your specific question, about 0.5 point was driven by, call it, the sales transfer in the comp is what we're seeing. So the strength really is broad-based.

The other thing that I love is we said from the beginning, we wanted to win the morning, and that is exactly what we're seeing. Our partners have done a terrific job of staffing, executing the Green Apron Service experience in the morning and frankly, balance of the day because we're growing transactions throughout the entire day. But the place where we saw the biggest move was in the morning.

And then in regard to your question about the pilot stores, this is actually something that we're really excited about. Our 650 pilot stores continue to outperform the fleet by about 200 basis points in comp, and we're seeing most of that is -- well, it is all pretty much driven by transactions. So what we continue to see is a great customer service experience in a great place with our partners doing their craft continually resonates with customers. And then I think you heard me talk about this, too. I think we're just getting the brand back on its front foot, both in its marketing communication and also the innovation that we're bringing forward. So I'm really delighted by where we are in this phase of the turnaround.

Our next questions come from the line of Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.

Brian Harbour
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I think sort of inherent in what you talked about was some additional cost opportunities, and it sounded like that's this year, but also over the next couple. Could you elaborate on what some of those will be and what you expect the timing to be?

Brian Niccol
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So I'm sure you guys probably saw this in some of our materials that have been released of late. We've got a clear plan in place to basically track down about $2 billion of costs. We really started that work in 2025. And I think it's going to unfold over the next 2 years in front of us. And so it really is across the entire P&L. So obviously, we've made some progress on G&A. We're going to continue to make progress in our procurement efforts. We think there's tremendous opportunity with using technology to drive efficiency in the work that we're doing.

And the thing that I love is -- and this is really to Cathy's credit and the team is it's not just one project that we're counting on, okay? We've got a list of projects with people's names next to it, clear deliverables. And the thing I love about the power of our organization is when one idea doesn't work, we get another idea that's up. And so that's what gives us confidence to be able to deliver on the cost side of things while we continue to drive the top line.

So it's going to be an ongoing program. We've identified the $2 billion over the next couple of years here. But I will tell you, it's something that we're going to be unrelenting, and it's going to be a consistent piece of our program going forward.

Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI.

David Palmer
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I wanted to ask a little bit about the earnings guidance for fiscal '26. Perhaps if you think there's some elements that you would like us to appreciate that might not be so obvious. I'd love to hear about that. And relatedly, the earnings guidance seems just a little wide, a little wider than I would have thought. What scenarios do you think would get you to the high end and the low end? What do those two scenarios look like?

Brian Niccol
Chairman & CEO

Yes, sure. Thanks, David. So the thing that gets us to the higher end is maintaining the performance on comp, first and foremost. And that's why we're really excited about the underlying strength that we're seeing that's driving the comp. And then obviously, we're going to continue to do the work on the cost side of things. But really here in the near term, it is going to be driven by comp, which is going to be supported by terrific execution on Green Apron Service model, the marketing menu innovation. And I think you'll hear at our Investor Day, all the comp drivers that, frankly, we have across digital, rewards, menu. I'm really optimistic about our future. But that's going to be the key piece is we got to continue to drive the top line, and we need to do it in a healthy way so that we maintain the integrity of the experience, and we give our customers access to the food and beverage that they want to experience in Starbucks.

Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank.

Lauren Silberman
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to unpack some of the same-store sales momentum. The non-rewards member growth outpacing rewards member growth, I think, over the last several quarters. It's great to see the rewards member back to positive. What's driving the differential between the two? And what do you see as the biggest opportunities to narrow the gap, if that's how you think about it?

Brian Niccol
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Yes. So thanks for the question. This is something that when I first came into Starbucks, I wanted to address because I had seen non-rewards customers declining for a consistent trend, and that's never healthy in a business. You have to win both with your rewards customers and, call it, the light or infrequent customer. And so when Tracy and I set out to discuss how we get back on our front foot, we knew we had to make sure that we had the marketing that was broad and we had to have the message about Starbucks that was broadly appealing. And I think that's what we're seeing happen with customers. And then look, the innovation, I think, has been on trend. We're getting back into culture, leading culture. Most recently, the Barista Mug was a, I would call it a lucky strike extra. Tracy would say that was intentional. But it is one of those things where you have to be relevant, leading culture so that you get the infrequent customer to hopefully grow with your brand.

And the thing that is exciting to see is our rewards customer user base is getting bigger. So we surpassed 35 million. And what is great about what's happening in a rewards customer is it's through better engagement that we're getting people to be active, not through discounting and couponing, but rather giving people the Starbucks Experience. And the thing that really makes Starbucks unique, which is our personalization. So when we do that personalization through the rewards program, we get rewarded with more visits from those customers.

And then I think you're going to hear really exciting things about the rewards program at our Investor Day on how Tracy and the team are going to make that program feel like it is made for you. And I think you'll see us have a step-up in performance with our rewards program as a result without letting up on driving our non-rewards customers as well. I almost hate calling it non-rewards customer because they're just as valuable. Every customer matters and every transaction matters, and we're going to give that type of experience to everybody so that they know they matter.

Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan Chase.

John Ivankoe
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

The question and really this is observation based. Certain coffee chains have kind of separated both in the U.S. and around the world, their morning execution from the afternoon execution. And I'm really wondering what kind of opportunity that might mean for Starbucks. Morning that might be faster, more consistent, but afternoon that might be more innovative, specifically around, for example, handcrafted blended energy is just one idea. So if you could kind of address that theme of a.m. versus p.m. daypart execution.

And secondly, and I think this is related, there's a lot of competition in this space that's accelerating, in fact, in some markets, almost all of it is drive-thru and takeout focused. I'm wondering if that's something that's really on your competitive radar at this point? And if there's anything specific that Starbucks should do or could do to perhaps blunt some of the sales momentum that some of these chains are seeing?

Brian Niccol
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, John. So first, to answer your question on the afternoon daypart versus the morning daypart, I think the way we think about it and the customer thinks about it is the morning is very much a ritual. There are a lot of habits that people have versus the afternoon is really a reset. And depending on where you are in that reset, you sometimes want a blended drink, you sometimes want an energy drink, you sometimes want a sparkling drink, okay? And you sometimes want protein. And what you're going to see us do, and this is why I'm really excited that we're going to finally be done rolling out digital menu boards. It will be across our entire system. It will allow us to daypart the menu and drive against these two key insights, right? The afternoon is a reset, the morning is a ritual. And in the afternoon, you're going to see us, and Tracy is going to be talking about this, we will have customized energy. We will have sparkling energy. We will have those indulgent drinks that people want, right, the Frappuccinos that we've made famous. And we will also have food that complements it. That's very much on trend.

So the good news is we've got a strong base already in the afternoon. I just think there is tremendous opportunity to unlock that afternoon daypart further by having more relevant beverages for how people want to reset in their day and then also complement it with food. And then we're going to use, I think, the traditional tactics you would do in order to market and merchandise that we are the right solution for that afternoon. And frankly, some of these places, we've been slow to develop. And so it presents a tremendous opportunity for our innovation pipeline to address it.

To your question on drive-through, mobile order pickup, one of the things that I've been really excited about is it really is an entire ecosystem, John. When we've got the cafe, the drive-thru and mobile order pickup all working together, we are unmatched, okay? And when I put that execution on any street corner, I am confident we will win. And there is an opportunity for us to put a lot more stores with that ecosystem all across the country and be very competitive.

So Mike and Meredith, they know our goal is to put our entire ecosystem through, I think, cost-effective buildings that ultimately our partners can run with excellence and give our customer the experience that they want. Because I know customers want those moments in the cafe. They want those moments in the drive-thru, and they want those moments for mobile order pickup. And we can do all of it, and we can do it with excellence. And so I really like where we're headed, and I'm excited about how our pipeline is being rebuilt and as we get back to building at the clip that we're capable of because we will have people capability as well to go with that building.

So thank you for the question because it really is areas that I think drive a lot of opportunity in this business, building the drive-thru cafe mobile order pickup experience with our cafes and then really building out an afternoon daypart on the strength of our morning daypart, I think, is just tremendous upside for us.

Our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bank of America.

Sara Senatore
BofA Securities, Research Division

A question on -- another question on same-store sales and then a clarification, I think, on Cathy, one of your comments. So just on same-store sales, you mentioned kind of service. I think that it sounds like service, Green Apron maybe a couple of hundred basis points, if you could disaggregate it. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about as you think about the comp, how much was maybe the service versus innovation versus marketing? I know that's a hard thing to do, but just as we think about sort of the sustainability of the comp going forward.

And then, Cathy, you mentioned guidance embeds flexibility to, I guess, to identify projects. I interpret that as perhaps investments as well as savings. So I just wanted to make sure I understood, is it plausible that you might find additional investments that you want to make this year in addition to the kind of annualizing the $500 million in the labor model?

Brian Niccol
Chairman & CEO

So I'll take the first part of that, and then I can hand it over to Cathy on the second part. So the first part is where you kind of ended your question, it's hard to separate these out. But what I can tell you is a strong operating foundation makes all the other initiatives that much more effective, right? So we would not have had the holiday experience that we had with the innovation that we had if we did not have our partners executing Green Apron Service model. And we heard it in the customer feedback, right? The customer feedback was, hey, something is different, and it's different in a good way. I feel the service experience, I love how Mike says this, like you're going to see our partners with eyes up. You're going to see our partners moving towards customers. You're going to see our partners wanting to make sure that their craft is being experienced the way it's intended to be experienced.

And so we heard it over and over again. We had the lowest level of customer complaints we've seen over the last couple of years. We've also seen that customers felt the speed or the convenience. So I think these are all service things. And then we also heard things like, hey, your menu is much more relevant. It seems more health relevant. It seems more flavor relevant. And so that's a sign that the marketing is working, connecting. And then also, I don't want to walk past the fact we've put seats back into our cafes. We've not put uplifts everywhere, but we've tried everything we can to get at least seats back into all our cafes.

And you know what, every cafe I walk into, guess what? People are sitting in those seats enjoying a cup of coffee or a beverage and dwelling. And that's what we want to have happen because when you walk into a cafe and grab a mobile order to go, and it's full of seats, you feel better about your purchase decision. You just do. And if you're driving through the drive-thru and you see through the window a thriving cafe, I think we all have had these experiences where it's like, well, on Saturday, when I'm walking the dog, I'll probably stop by the Starbucks and linger.

So it really is working in harmony. It was why it was so important that we get the operating foundation strong and that then we ultimately dial up the marketing and the menu innovation. So it's hard to distill it. What I can tell you, though, is the fact that they're both working together is why we're seeing the transaction performance that we're seeing. And then on your question about the cost side, I'll hand it over to Cathy.

Catherine Smith
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

Sara, I look forward to seeing you tomorrow. When we talked about having flexibility, it's really about our first objective is to make sure we're supporting the business. And so we're going to continue to do that and bring -- our Back to Starbucks strategy and our plan. And so we want to make sure we've got the right flexibility to do that. We're -- you'll hear this again tomorrow, but this is not about broad-based cost cutting. We are making sure we invest in what matters most. And so we want to make sure that we've got that flexibility inside the P&L and our guidance. Obviously, we've talked about the Green Apron Service investment we're doing. We'll continue to evolve our supply chain, which will have a little bit of investment here and there, but we equally see the opportunities for reduction or savings there as well. And all of that's embedded inside of our guidance.

Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.

Jeffrey Bernstein
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great. As I think about the U.S. portfolio, comp growth is often volatile, but the unit growth is more stable in terms of a revenue driver over time. Brian, I think you just mentioned putting more restaurants on corners across the U.S. and being able to still win versus the competition. Just wondering if you could talk conceptually about, one, the rate of reacceleration in the U.S. and two, kind of how you think about the opportunity over time. I think last year, you mentioned talking about doubling the long-term store count. So I'm just wondering how you think about that, whether there's some sort of penetration analysis that you've done to give you that level of confidence and kind of the cost versus return analysis. Any color at least conceptually in terms of the glide path to reacceleration and where you could ultimately get to would be great.

Brian Niccol
Chairman & CEO

Yes, yes. Thanks for the question. And obviously, we'll get into a lot more of the details on the new unit growth opportunity, both in the U.S. and around the world tomorrow. What I will say right now, though, is like there are thousands of sites that we've looked at and I've identified right now. So there's no barrier on unit growth. Frankly, the issues we needed to address was making sure that we're building the right unit, and we had the people capability to open up those new units successfully. And so we put both things in place, right? We're going to have what we're calling now coffeehouse coaches, which are assistant store managers. That's going to be a pipeline to enable new store openings from a people standpoint. Right? Because it also creates, I think, a great career path for our partners on their path to becoming a coffeehouse leader. And then it also allows us to have more stability in the system while we add new units versus what I saw when I first got here is new units were very disruptive on our people, and we can't have that happen.

The other thing that we're addressing is the build cost and the actual, I would say, flow that we're going to build. And so I love the new building. We've called it the Ristretto, right? We've got the tall and grande executions on that Ristretto. And then we also have a Pico version of the Ristretto. And so I love the fact that we've got flexibility in the size, and we can execute all of our access modes -- and then we've got the people capability system set up to also then support the people that you need to open these stores. But we'll get into a lot more of these details tomorrow. I'd just leave you with there's thousands of opportunities in the U.S., and there are thousands outside the U.S. And our growth opportunity on new units is exciting.

Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort with Guggenheim Partners.

Gregory Francfort
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Brian, there were some comments, I guess, in the proxy about adding a couple of platforms as part of the turnaround efforts. And I guess I'm wondering, where does the menu stand today versus when you got there in terms of either SKU or products? And how much have you cleaned up? And then as you look at holes in the menu, where are you looking to identify opportunities to kind of maybe add back some excitement and some marketing to the customer?

Brian Niccol
Chairman & CEO

Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. Yes, I believe we've reduced the menu by like 25%. And then if you even go back further, we've reduced it even further than that. But based on my time just here, it's probably been a reduction of like 25%, 30% and then the platforms that we're after are like a health and wellness platform, which we started with protein. You'll continue to see us push against the health and wellness platform going forward. I think there's an afternoon platform, both in beverage and in food. And not surprising, in beverage, I think it is going to be this personalized energy that can be executed as still sparkling and blended. So there's a pipeline for that platform.

And then also, just to give you an example, on food, I think there's a real opportunity, not surprising, to make sure we have food for how people want to eat, snackable, protein, fiber, right? These are the things for how people want to eat and reset in their afternoon. So -- most recently, you probably saw us talking about another platform area, which is making the bake case more artisanal. So you're going to see us have pastries that I think you're going to want to eat with your eyes, okay? And that is really the heritage of Starbucks. Like it is about craft, it's about artisanal. And I think we can do this in bakery. We can do this in what I would call snackable food. Obviously, we're already doing it in breakfast, right? Our Egg Bites, I think, are iconic. And I think we have the opportunity with these platforms to create more iconic food and beverage. And I think you guys are going to be really excited when you see the customized/personalized energy platform that really leverages a strength, which is our refreshers platform.

So that's what we mean by we want to be building platforms into the business. It's things that we can then innovate against without having to introduce at the same time.

Our next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh with BTIG.

Peter Saleh
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. I did want to ask about the throughput initiatives. Brian, I think you mentioned you're now below the 4-minute promise. Is that where you want to be for Starbucks at this point? Or do you feel like there's more opportunities to improve throughput? And if so, where do you think we can get to over the next year or so?

Brian Niccol
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks for the question. Look, we've made great progress on throughput at peak. We still have opportunity on the tails, though. There are still too many occasions throughout the day where we aren't hitting our metric. So there still is opportunity, frankly, to get the entire business every transaction to be under 4 minutes. We've not achieved that. But what we have achieved is, I think, great performance during peaks, which is really, in my opinion, my experience in this industry, you have excellence at the peaks, you can then win with the shoulders and then ultimately balance of day. That really is kind of what I mean by fine-tuning the model.

And I think one of the things that is crystal clear to us is there is demand when we can get the speed and convenience right as evidenced by getting more standard opening hours. All our stores now are pretty much opening at 5 a.m. And you know what, I wouldn't be surprised if 5 a.m. becomes 4:30 a.m. because of the throughput and the experience that we provide. It's just a matter of time, and we'll earn our way into that.

And then the other thing I will tell you, too, is our teams are just getting more reps. The more reps they get, the better we perform. And then you see that in, I think, the 650 stores that are part of the lead pilot. And then you also see that, frankly, in our grow program. And having our teams really focus in on just a couple of key metrics that are in their control really is a big unlock. It eliminates a lot of the complexity, eliminates a lot of the noise and it allows them to focus on great craft, great speed and ultimately, great experiences. So there's still lots of upside in our mobile order pickup business, our cafe business, our drive-thru business. And I didn't really talk about this much, but we've also got a really nice emerging delivery business.

So we just got to get our Green Apron Service labor model dialed in, get our teams the reps that they need with stability and then keep with consistent metrics so they know when they perform, they're recognized for their performance accordingly. So I think Mike and the team, and you'll hear more about this tomorrow at Investor Day, have a great plan for how we unlock the demand that Starbucks has.

Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo.

Zachary Fadem
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Brian and Cathy, is there any color you can offer on the magnitude of operating margin performance in the first half of the year versus the second half? And you mentioned about 1/3 of the pressure today related to product and distribution inflation. Is there a glide path in your mind in terms of these pressures rolling off?

Brian Niccol
Chairman & CEO

Yes, I'll start and maybe I can let Cathy fill in. I think you heard Cathy say some of the inflation, specifically coffee and the tariff headwinds start to peak here in Q2, and we start rolling off of it into the back half as well as we start to roll over the initial big investment into our Green Apron Service model. And then compound that with -- we've got a very conscious effort on cost, which is this $2 billion program over the next 2 or 3 years. So I obviously envision that earnings will continue to pick up as we maintain the top line momentum that we have. But Cathy, I don't know if you want to add anything.

Catherine Smith
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. I think Brian hit really the kind of the 4 big ones. We've got the anniversary of the investment in Green Apron Service, which you talked about. That will -- we get anniversarying it by the fourth quarter. The savings program that we've got in place, while we've been working hard and at speed, a lot of that starts to come to fruition beyond some of the restructuring we already did comes to fruition toward the back half of the year. And then the tariff and coffee, we do expect to abate in Q3 and Q4. And then the most important one is the sales leverage, just make sure that we continue to drive the top line like we expect. So all of that will weight it a little bit more to the back half of the year.

Our next question comes from the line of Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein.

Danilo Gargiulo
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

Excited to see that you're focusing even more on health and wellness platform. And I was wondering if you can maybe, Brian, start to dimensionalize a little bit how much of the shift in menu -- expansion of your menu could be contributing to your comps going forward. Specifically, if you can comment on how much the protein beverages lineup is mixing today? And what's your expectations as it grows over time and potentially how other platforms will complement that?

Brian Niccol
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks for the question. So we launched the protein platform back in early Q1. And what I'm happy to say is here in Q2, as we, not surprising, revisited the platform in January, we saw a nice recommitment to the platform from customers. So it is one of those examples of being very much on trend with how people want to eat and drink. And this is a platform that I think was going to continue to build for us. As a matter of fact, I might have started my day with a vanilla protein latte.

But look, the thing that is most exciting is customers when they experience it, they really like it. Awareness is still pretty surprisingly low, but the trial and the repeat rates are really, really great. So meaning when someone tries it, we see a high level of repeat and it has proven to be highly incremental. So this is one we wouldn't keep doing. And as I said, the thing I always love is you don't want to launch and leave things, you want to launch and leverage things. And that's exactly what we saw with our protein platform in January.

Catherine Smith
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

Maybe I'd add just two more things really quickly that we're excited about for protein is it's -- we have seen it's a traffic driver, meaning it's the intention of why the customer is coming in. So that's getting us to access new customers or at least new occasions. And then the other thing is that maybe has been a little surprising is the popularity of the cold foam and protein in the cold foam. It's a great way to get that extra 15 grams or so of protein for our customers, and you can put it pretty much on every single drink. And so I think those have been maybe two of the positives or highlights we found out of the protein launch.

Our last question will come from the line of Chris O'Cull with Stifel.

Christopher O'Cull
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Brian, I know you mentioned you aren't taking your foot off the gas in terms of broad-based marketing. Could you just elaborate on how instrumental that's been in turning the tide for non-reward customers? And then Cathy, as you look at the 420 basis points of margin contraction in North America, how much of this marketing step-up should we kind of model as a permanent rebasing of G&A OpEx line versus maybe a temporary marketing turnaround cost?

Brian Niccol
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So I'll start, and then I'll hand it over to Cathy. The marketing, I think, has done a great job of getting the brand back in front of all of our customers. And the metrics that we track, right, are brand affinity, the trust, and we're seeing all those metrics move up. We're also seeing our brand value scores move up. And what I ultimately say is like it's one thing to see what people are claiming. It's another thing to see it in their behavior. And what I'm seeing in their behavior is every age cohort has increased their visitation with Starbucks over the last couple of months. And so that just demonstrates to me that we're doing a great job of making the brand relevant, making the brand a leader and making the brand one that innovates on the right things at the right time so that people want to engage with Starbucks.

And so I really have to give Tracy and the team a lot of credit, both our digital efforts, our personalization efforts, our menu innovation efforts. And I think just -- I don't know if you've seen the most recent ad, the Together ad that we have running, personally, it's one of my favorites. It makes you feel good about the brand. It makes you start to see the soul of the brand. And I think that's what we're bringing back, and that's what I mean by the shine of Starbucks is back, the soul, the feeling, the emotion that you get when you get to have a moment to connect with humanity. And I think people want it. And when we get it right, people love it. And we're seeing that happen that's relevant with every age group and every income group.

Catherine Smith
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

How we think about our investment in marketing is we look at our total spend, looking at discounts as well, and those were not quite as effective. So we've taken some money and repurposed it into marketing. What I can tell you is this, we believe that, that's an ongoing expense. We think it's an important investment in the brand. So that is something you should continue, but it's all included in our guidance. But we really have just reallocated some of the less effective discounts into far more effective marketing dollars.

Operator

That was our last question. So I'll now turn the call back over to Brian Niccol for closing remarks.

Brian Niccol
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thank you. And thanks, everybody, for the questions. And I really do look forward to seeing, hopefully, everybody at our Investor Day tomorrow. The long-term plan that we have in place is one that I am really excited about. And I think you'll see our executive team and our leadership team share the growth story that we have in front of us.

I do want to just leave you with a few things. Obviously, we are very delighted with where we are on the top line, and we believe we're going to continue to drive that momentum and then the earnings will obviously come behind it. And I also want to emphasize, in any turnaround, the path is never linear, but I do believe we've got the right plans, the right team and the right focus going forward. And our Back to Starbucks plan really is the strategic currency of our turnaround. And I really do want to thank our partners, both in the stores and in our support centers because they really are the foundation of the progress and the performance that we're achieving. So I couldn't be more excited for them and the Starbucks Company to be able to have the shine back. And I couldn't be more excited to share our story with everyone tomorrow at Investor Day on our long-term plans for continued growth and just how much opportunity there is for Starbucks, not just in the U.S. but around the world.

So thank you and look forward to seeing everybody tomorrow.
