[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss of JPMorgan.

Matthew Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So on relative performance, your comp this quarter came in below both of your off-price peers. This is a clear reversal from results in the second quarter and over the last year. Clearly, you cited weather was a factor, but how concerned are you by this change in your relative comp versus peers?

Michael O'Sullivan
CEO & Director

Thank you for the question. You're right. Just to lay out the facts, we ran a 1% comp in Q3. Our peers were 6% and 7%, very impressive. That's a very significant difference. I can't give you a complete bridge, but at a high level, let me try and dissect that gap.

I'll start with the obvious. We know that weather was the biggest driver of our slowdown in Q3. That's not an excuse, but it is a partial explanation. We changed our name some years ago, but shoppers still call us Burlington Coat Factory. So mild weather in September and October has a huge impact on our business. This is a real thing, and it is unique to us, I think, versus our peers.

Now in September and October, cold weather merchandise balloons to more than 20% of our assortment. In the third quarter, our comp sales for ladies and men's coats, jackets, boots and cold weather accessories, all these important categories were down double digits. Now they bounced back in mid-October once it turned cold. But by then, it was too late to really drive the quarter.

Let me go a little further and try to quantify the weather impact on our comp in Q3. If you strip out the drag on our overall comp from cold weather categories, the categories I just listed, and if I make an adjustment for the impact that lower weather-related traffic had on the rest of the store, then I can get to the low end of a mid-single-digit comp. In other words, I do not get to 6% or 7% comp. So in my view, weather only explains half of the gap versus peers.

Now usually, in off-price, when your comp is lower than your peers, it's just the customer telling you that they preferred the value and the assortment that they found elsewhere. In the second quarter, when we ran a 5% comp growth ahead of our peers, the customer was voting for us. But in Q3, that changed. And we have some hypotheses on why, but we have more work to do to really tear that apart and then aggressively go after that performance difference.

But before I leave the question, let me just call out a silver lining. The comp numbers that our peers have just reported reaffirm that the off-price shopper at all income levels is alive and well. Leaving aside the weather, the major implication for us is that we need to take better advantage of that than we did in the third quarter.

Matthew Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. And then, Kristin, as a follow-up, could you provide more color on the 60 basis points of operating margin expansion in the quarter, particularly just given as we think about the pressures that you faced from tariffs and the 1% comp?

Kristin Wolfe
Executive VP & CFO

Matt, thanks for the question. Yes, first, it's worth reiterating that we really are pleased with the 6.2% operating margin in the quarter, up 60 basis points versus last year on a 1% comp, as you noted in your question. Let me provide the major puts and takes.

Starting with gross margin. First, our merchandise margin increased 10 basis points. And within merchandise margin, there was a lot going on. Tariffs had a negative impact on markup, but we were able to offset this impact through numerous actions such as negotiating with our vendors, adjusting the mix and driving a faster turn. The net impact of all this was much more favorable than we originally guided back in August. This was really driven by our tariff mitigation strategies.

Now staying in gross margin, freight levered by 20 basis points. This was due to greater efficiencies and cost savings initiatives, particularly in transportation. So our overall gross margin increased 30 basis points versus the third quarter of last year, all this despite the impact from tariffs.

On product sourcing costs moving down the P&L, we drove 40 basis points of leverage here. This was driven by supply chain and efficiency initiatives in our DCs. We're excited about the consistent progress we've made in streamlining our supply chain costs.

And moving on to SG&A, we showed about 20 basis points of leverage here on a 1% comp, and this was driven by efficiency initiatives in stores such as speeding up checkout times at point of sale. Offsetting this leverage was higher depreciation, which delevered about 20 basis points, driven by increased CapEx in supply chain and new stores. So taken all together, this drove the 60 basis points of EBIT expansion in the quarter.

Next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo.

Irwin Boruchow
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I guess my question kind of piggybacking off of Matt's. So the comp growth in Q3 was lower than peers, but the margin and earnings were actually pretty much better. How should we reconcile that? And then really more importantly, are there choices that you made during the quarter that may have driven the higher margin in Q3 at the expense of sales?

Michael O'Sullivan
CEO & Director

Well, I'll take that, Ike. Thank you for the question. It's a good question. I think the direct answer is yes. There were decisions or choices that we made that helped drive our margin in Q3, but may have had a negative impact on our sales. And I'll give you a couple of examples, but maybe I should just preface what I'm going to say with a couple of points.

Firstly, our margin and earnings performance in Q3 was very strong. Margins were up 60 basis points and adjusted EPS grew 16%. We've also taken up full year earnings guidance. In other words, we've rolled right over tariffs. Secondly, on comp sales, to reiterate, the biggest driver of the slowdown that we saw was weather. If I adjust our comp for weather, we probably would have been pretty happy with the outcome. But as I explained a moment ago, that only explains half of the gap between our 1% comp growth and our peers' 6% and 7% comp.

So if I come back to your question, yes, there were choices that we made that might explain our relatively strong margin and earnings performance and our weaker comp growth in Q3. Now these were choices that we made as part of our tariff mitigation strategies. And let me describe two specific examples.

When -- firstly, when tariffs were introduced -- first introduced, we reduced our sales and receipt plans for categories where the margin impact was too significant. We did not feel like we could raise retails in those categories, and we did not want to accept the margin compression. That meant that in some businesses, especially some categories in home, our inventory levels and assortments were -- they were very light in Q3. And we saw that in terms of the sales in those categories. The sales were lower. Now that wasn't an error. It was a deliberate decision. I would say it was an economically rational decision, and it worked. It may have hurt sales, but it drove our earnings in Q3.

Now I should add that as tariff rates have come down, we've gone back and we've taken up sales and receipt plans in most of the categories that were affected. So I would expect this impact to be less significant in Q4. A second example, as Kristin described a moment ago, another step that we took to help offset tariffs was to trim inventory levels in many businesses across the store and force a faster turn. Again, this helped to offset the margin pressure from tariffs. Now we only really took that step in Q3, not in Q4. We already turned very fast in Q4. So we didn't want to try and force a faster turn going into holiday. But again, in Q3, that approach drove earnings, but it may have hurt sales.

So -- for both of the examples I've just given, at a high level, those decisions worked. We fully absorbed tariff pressure on our margin, and we drove very strong margin and earnings growth in Q3. And all this happened actually despite a slowdown in comp sales due to weather. Normally, a slowdown like that would drive deleverage. Anyway, with that said, we really need to do a full after-action assessment on Q3. Now that we have our competitors' comp results, we need to go back and hindsight our performance and identify anything we could have done or should have done differently.

Irwin Boruchow
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then maybe, Kristin, just to elaborate maybe a little more on the 2026 initial outlook, key risk opportunities in the outlook, anything else you could share?

Kristin Wolfe
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Great. Thanks, Ike. We're still -- it's still somewhat early in the process. We're actively working through the budget for 2026. But let me give some headlines or how we're thinking about it.

The outlook for next year is pretty hard to predict with significant economic and political uncertainty that could absolutely affect consumers' discretionary spending. There are potential tailwinds like the possibility of higher tax refunds in the early part of next year. And then there are potential headwinds like tariff-driven price increases, which could put additional inflationary pressure on our core customer. Michael spoke to this earlier, but given this uncertainty, we're planning to stick with our off-price playbook. That really means planning comps at flat to 2% and positioning us to chase the trend if it's stronger.

In terms of new stores, we mentioned this in the prepared remarks, but it's worth reiterating, we feel very good about the new store pipeline. We are planning to open at least 110 net new stores in 2026. So combined with our comp guidance, this should drive a high single-digit increase in total sales.

On the operating margin side, as we said, we're modeling operating margin flat to last year at the 2% comp. We do expect 10 to 15 basis points of leverage for every point above a 2% comp. And then there's a couple of things in the margin, a couple of puts and takes. We are planning for slightly higher merch margin as we look to offset any impact of tariffs, particularly as we lap the fall season next year. We're planning for continued supply chain productivity gains next year, but there will be offsets here due to the start-up costs and the initial ramp-up of our new Southeastern distribution center, which we plan to open in the first half of 2026.

And finally, we do expect fixed cost leverage on the high single-digit total sales growth, but we also are expecting higher depreciation, which creates deleverage. The higher depreciation is really due to the higher CapEx spend in supply chain and our increased number of new stores. Those are really the main call-outs for 2026 at this point.

Your next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America.

Lorraine Maikis
BofA Securities, Research Division

Michael, one of your off-price peers is accelerating comps with more focus on marketing, more in-store inventory and a store refresh. Do you see any risk that Burlington will lose market share?

Michael O'Sullivan
CEO & Director

Lorraine, thank you for the question. It's a good question. I'm going to avoid talking about any specific competitor, but I think I can still try to answer your question maybe in more general terms. I'll start by saying that actually, we like innovation and fresh ideas. We believe in off-price retail. And anything that drives off-price awareness and excitement is a good thing. In fact, I'd go further and say that a strong off-price sector is important for us. So it's good that our off-price peers are achieving very strong results.

But your question was more about potential risks to Burlington. So let me come at it from that angle. I think there are 2 important points that I would make here. Firstly, when we talk among each other -- to each other and when we talk to analysts and when we talk to investors, I think we sometimes talk about off-price as if it were a separate isolated ring-fenced segment of retail. But the customer does not think of it that way. The customer does not respect the boundaries of off-price. If she needs a pair of pants or a dress, she might shop Burlington or one of our off-price peers. But we know from our own research that she also cross-shops department stores, specialty retailers. In fact, any retailer where she likes the assortment, she doesn't care about our off-price business definition. She just cares about finding a great deal and great value in the categories, brands and styles that she's looking for.

Now if you're an off-price -- if you're an investor in off-price, I think it's very important that you understand this. This is not like the retail market for office supplies. We aren't 3 companies just scrapping it out for market share in a limited space called off-price. It's bigger than that. We compete in a very large and competitively fragmented market for apparel, accessories, shoes, home, beauty and so on. Off-price is really just a small part of that overall market. Our opportunity is to take share from non-off-price retailers. That's what has been happening over a long period of time.

So I mean, just to bring it up to -- just to throw in some numbers, today, we announced 7% total sales growth in Q3 on top of 11% growth last year. At those growth rates, it's self-evident that we are taking market share, but so are our off-price peers. These share gains are not coming at the expense of each other. Mathematically, that wouldn't be possible. These share gains are coming from non-off-price. And I think that the shift from traditional full-price retail to off-price is unlikely to end anytime soon. So that's the first point.

The second point I would make is that despite everything I've just said, I think it's very important and useful for us to pay close attention to our off-price peers. They matter. They operate a similar business model to us. They've been very successful over the years, and we can learn a lot from them. So if our off-price peers come up with new ways of doing things, new processes in stores, new innovative marketing programs, then we need to pay close attention. Now not all of those ideas will work, of course. And certainly, not all of them will make sense for us, but we need to be open to new ideas that could help drive our business and actually drive off-price retail in general.

Let me finish up. Again, your question was about risk to Burlington. Right now, I see off-price as a whole as being very healthy. For 2025, we now expect to grow total sales by 8% on top of 11% last year. And at the high end of our guidance, we now expect to achieve EPS growth of 18% on top of 38 -- sorry, 34% last year. Those are -- by any metric, those are very healthy numbers. I anticipate that our off-price peers are going to be successful, too. But I don't see that as a risk. In fact, it's better for us if the off-price segment as a whole continues to perform well.

Lorraine Maikis
BofA Securities, Research Division

And I wanted to follow up on pricing. Did you take price in 3Q? And what impact did that have on your comp? And then what's your strategy on pricing for the fourth quarter?

Michael O'Sullivan
CEO & Director

Yes. That's a good question. I would sum up our pricing strategy in 3 words. Be very careful. We recognize that because of tariffs, prices are going up across the retail industry, but we will not raise prices unless we've seen them go up elsewhere. And even then, we will test and monitor the impact of those price increases. We've said this many times before, we have a very price-sensitive customer. We know that the reason that they shop at Burlington is that they're looking for a great deal. Our core strategy is to offer great value. And of course, that means keeping prices low.

Now our approach to tariffs this year has been to avoid retail price increases and to focus instead on finding other margin and expense offsets. Kristin described those actions earlier. We're very pleased with how that approach has worked. It's allowed us to avoid price increases, but still to grow margin and earnings this year.

Now of course, we have tested some things. We've tried some higher prices. And in Q3, when we saw other retailers take prices up, we tested higher retails in some categories. But I would say that those pricing tests were in a very limited number of areas. And mostly the higher retails worked. We saw very little resistance from customers.

So going forward, I would say that we will probably get more aggressive, but we kind of have to see what happens in Q4. And also, of course, we need to see what happens with tariff rates going forward.

Your next question comes from the line of John Kernan of TD Cowen.

John Kernan
TD Cowen, Research Division

Michael, sounds like you see an opportunity to take up the number of new store openings and the cadence of growth. Can you expand a bit upon this? What are you seeing in terms of the new store pipeline, both from a real estate perspective and also potential new store productivity?

Kristin Wolfe
Executive VP & CFO

John, it's Kristin. I'll take this one. We're really pleased with the performance of our new stores across the board, they've been delivering results that are in line or better than expectations as well as our financial hurdles. It really reinforces the strength of our site selection process and the appeal of Burlington really across markets.

And it's worth pointing out just some data. Our Q3 comp, of course, was at the midpoint of our guidance, but our total sales growth in Q3 was at the high end of our guidance, up 7%, and this was driven by new stores. And based on our Q4 guidance, our total sales increase is planned at 9% at the high end as we benefit from the slew of new stores we just opened in the third quarter, 73 net new.

Now as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we now expect to open 104 net new stores this year. This is a modest step-up from our original plan of 100 net new. And this increase reflects really two things. First, the ability to pull forward some openings that were originally slated for 2026; and secondly, the strength of our real estate pipeline.

Looking ahead to 2026, we're raising that new store target to at least 110 net new stores. This is supported by this robust pipeline, but also by 45 leases we secured from the Joann Fabrics bankruptcy. These incremental sites really give us confidence in sustaining the high level of growth next year. And as for the pipeline for 2027 and beyond, it's still early to provide specific numbers, but I will say we feel very good about the long-term opportunity. Our real estate team continues to identify attractive locations, and we already have a very healthy pipeline for new stores beyond 2026.

John Kernan
TD Cowen, Research Division

Got it. Maybe as a follow-up, obviously, all 3 off-price retailers are resonating strongly with consumers. I liked how Michael framed the industry's opportunity. You're clearly feeling more bullish on the number of stores, maybe a little bit more cautious on comp sales, but more bullish on the potential margin expansion potential for the business. Is that the right way to think about it?

Kristin Wolfe
Executive VP & CFO

Great. Yes. John, thanks for that question. It's a good question. So 2 years ago, we shared our objective of getting to approximately $1.6 billion in operating income by 2028. The headline is that we feel very good about the progress we're making toward this goal. We're tracking in line with where we thought we would be at this point. And we're especially pleased with the progress we made in driving operating margin at the high end, Michael said this earlier, but it's worth repeating, at the high end of our updated 2025 margin guidance, we will have achieved 170 basis points of the 400 basis points of opportunity that we identified 2 years ago. And we will have achieved this despite the negative headwind from tariffs.

So really, to sum up, we're pleased with the progress. But the way you characterized the long-range model and your question is about right. It's true, we're more bullish on new stores, and we are more bullish on margin expansion. On the comp, we still believe we can drive an average annual comp growth of 4% to 5% over the remaining 3 years of the long-range plan, but we recognize that there is external uncertainty, so we are slightly more cautious here.

Question comes from the line of Brooke Roach of Goldman Sachs.

Brooke Roach
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Michael, I'd like to ask you about the trends that you're seeing with the lower income customer. How did these customers perform in the third quarter? And are there any other callouts in terms of customer demographics that are worth sharing?

Michael O'Sullivan
CEO & Director

Brooke, thank you for the question. The headline is that we feel very good about the lower-income customer. We've been -- and the trends that we're seeing with that demographic. We've been watching this particular demographic segment very closely all year. This is a critical customer for us. Given the economic uncertainty and the cost of living issues, we've been concerned about lower-income customers.

But the good news is that this customer has been very resilient. When we look at our stores in lower-income trade areas, they continue to outperform the chain. This has been true for several quarters now. I should say, as we listen to other retailers, it seems like this is a consistent pattern. Many retailers are reporting strength with lower-income consumers.

There is -- in terms of other demographic call-outs, there's one other call out, specifically relating to Hispanic customers. Again, we've been watching this demographic very closely all year. It's an important customer for us. We have many stores across the country that are in trade areas with a high proportion of Hispanic households. You may recall that in previous quarters, we've said that our stores that are in trade areas with a high proportion of Hispanic households have been slightly outperforming the chain in terms of comp growth. While in Q3, the trend in those stores slipped. They've gone from slightly outperforming the chain to trailing the chain.

Now the change in trend for those stores varies a lot depending on the specific market and even the specific or the particular location of the store. In other words, it's very localized to what's happening in those particular cities. And of course, it's difficult for us to say how long those localized slowdowns might last.

Brooke Roach
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Great. And then my follow-up would be for Kristin. Kristin, can you give us more color about your guidance for the fourth quarter, both in terms of comp sales and for earnings?

Kristin Wolfe
Executive VP & CFO

Brooke, thanks for the question. Sure. Let me repeat a little bit. I think it's worth reiterating some of what we described earlier. On comp store sales and total store sales, we're maintaining our Q4 previously issued guidance. So comp of flat to 2% and total sales growth of 7% to 9%. We do, as we said, feel really good about our recent trend in Q4, but it's still early in the quarter. The critical weeks are ahead of us. And in those coming weeks, we'll be up against very strong comparisons from last year. So we'll continue to take a cautious approach on sales.

On the margin side, we are increasing our margin and EPS guidance for Q4. We now expect our Q4 adjusted EBIT margin to increase by 30 to 50 basis points. We do anticipate some tariff-driven pressure on merch margin in Q4 but we expect to more than fully offset that pressure and drive overall operating margin expansion in Q4 versus last year. And the drivers of the margin leverage should largely be similar to what we saw in Q3. We expect continued cost savings in freight and supply chain and in store-related initiatives. And finally, we should also see additional leverage in SG&A given the higher incentive comp accrual in the fourth quarter of last year.

The question comes from the line of Alex Straton of Morgan Stanley.

Alexandra Straton
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Michael, can you talk about the availability of off-price merchandise as you're heading into the fourth quarter? And then I have a quick follow-up.

Michael O'Sullivan
CEO & Director

Yes. Alex, thank you for the question. I would characterize the buying environment for off-price as very, very strong. Earlier in the year, when tariffs were first introduced, there were some concerns, a lot of concerns about whether vendors would be reluctant to bring potentially excess merchandise into the country. But frankly, those concerns have just not materialized. Even some of the categories where supply was tighter in the summer, categories like housewares and home also housewares and toys have come back. I think that's probably pretty consistent with what you've heard from our off-price peers. There's a lot of great merchandise at great values, and we're taking advantage of it, both to flow to stores and to build up reserve.

Alexandra Straton
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Perfect. And then just on the cold weather merchandise in the quarter. Is there any just additional detail you can provide on that dynamic, the impact on the overall comp for the chain? I know you've given a lot of details, but anything else worth highlighting there?

Michael O'Sullivan
CEO & Director

Sure. Yes. Yes. So after back-to-school, the cold weather merchandise becomes very important to our mix. As I said earlier, it expands to more than 20% of our total assortment during the quarter. Now cold weather merchandise, just to define it, includes categories like coats, jackets, boots and accessories like gloves and scarves. So it's only stuff you need if it's cold outside. And our customer is very need-driven.

For September through mid-October, our comp sales in those businesses were down in the negative mid-teens. Then in the last 2 weeks of October, once the weather turned cold, they grew up double-digit comp. Maybe if I step back for a moment, there are 2 ways in which milder weather in September and October affects our business. There is the direct drag on our overall comp growth from lower sales in the cold weather categories that I just mentioned. That's one impact.

But there is also an impact on our non-cold weather businesses because if you think about it, if the customer comes in to buy a coat, she's probably going to put some other things in the basket, too. So if -- because the weather is mild, she doesn't come into the store to buy that coat, then this doesn't just hurt our coat sales, it impacts other businesses as well.

Now mathematically, the drag on our overall comp from cold weather categories alone was worth about 200 basis points in Q3. If you then add the impact that lower traffic had on other non-cold weather categories, you can easily get up to a few points of comp. And I think that's somewhat consistent with the fact that we saw a bounce back to mid-single-digit comp growth in the second half of October once the weather had turned cold.

Your last question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager of Baird.

Mark Altschwager
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Kristin, could you give us some more detail on regional trends, category trends as well as any of the detailed comp metrics for Q3?

Kristin Wolfe
Executive VP & CFO

Mark, yes, absolutely. In terms of regional performance, the Southeast was our strongest region in the quarter. The West, Northeast and Midwest were in line with the chain, while the Southwest trailed the chain. On category performance, we saw the strongest performance in beauty, accessories and shoes. Apparel comp slightly above the chain, while home was softer, comping below the chain in Q3.

In terms of the comp metrics, our traffic was down in the third quarter. That was largely driven by September and early October when weather was unseasonably warm. And this lower traffic was offset by a higher average basket size. So for the quarter, we were pleased to see that both conversion and basket size or average transaction size were higher than last year. So this tells us that once she's in the store, she liked what she saw.

Mark Altschwager
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Excellent. And then, Michael, as we look at the Q4 comp guidance, do you view that as conservative just given typically less weather sensitivity in the fourth quarter?

Michael O'Sullivan
CEO & Director

Mark, sometimes when we give comp guidance, we'll also sort of signal, if you like, if we think there may be upside. I don't think -- I don't see a lot of upside in our Q4 comp guidance. The reason I say that is that we're up against 6% comp growth from Q4 last year, so 6%. If you take our 0% to 2% guidance, that gets you to a 2-year stack of 6% to 8%. Now we exceeded that in Q2 of this year, but we were well below it in Q3.

I should also add that when I look at our off-price peers, the way I'm interpreting their guidance, it looks like they are slightly below us on a 2-year stack basis. So even though we're happy with our recent trends and with how we started the quarter, and we're excited for our holiday assortments. We're not anticipating significant upside to our Q4 comp sales guidance at this point.
