[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Godyn with Citigroup.

John Godyn
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I was hoping you could elaborate a bit on the commercial aftermarket backdrop. Obviously, it was a great services quarter with revenue growth accelerating versus last quarter. So I'm just curious to what extent this momentum has carried through to start the year? And if you could just unpack some of the assumptions underlying the mid-teens services growth guidance for 2026. Is there any room there to outperform if recent momentum continues?

H. Culp
Chairman & CEO

Well, John, thanks for getting us started. I would say we haven't seen anything here at the beginning of the year that gives us pause relative to the tailwinds, the momentum that you referenced continuing, right? We've all seen Delta and United out just in the last week, for example, I think talking confidently about 2026. So when you couple their outlook, the fact that we come into the year with $190 billion of backlog, we know our share of cycles with LEAP in particular, the narrow-body segment being up and the opportunities to leverage that underlying unit volume in the aftermarket with both expanded work scopes in both narrow and wide-body as well as price, we feel like we have another very strong commercial services year supporting the aftermarket. Again, I think we commented in the prepared remarks at a rate that should be up mid-teens.

Will we be able to do better than that? We're certainly going to aim to do that. But as we talked through the course of 2025, we're not, I think, particularly concerned about the demand environment. It's really all about our ability to move spare parts out to third parties to complete our own internal shop visits. And while we were pleased with the sequential and the year-over-year numbers that we cited in the fourth quarter, there's much more to do here in 2026. It's a bit of what undergirds the organizational move that we announced. And to the extent that we can continue to make progress, and we think we will, perhaps not in line with the 40% bump we saw from our priority suppliers last year on a full year basis, I think we'll be able to satisfy that demand better than we did in 2025. Rahul, anything you'd add there?

Blaire Shoor
Head of Investor Relations

Yes. Rahul, anything you'd add there.

Rahul Ghai
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Just a couple of things. John, welcome to our call here. Just as we said in our prepared remarks, we expect both shop visits and spare parts to be up kind of in the same range as mid-teens as the overall services growth. On spare parts first, our delinquency when we ended 2025 was up 50% over where we ended '24. So as Larry mentioned, strong demand environment. And as you think about the spare parts growth, the spare parts growth is going to be primarily driven by narrowbody. And that's coming as our LEAP external channel continues to grow and about more than 15% of the LEAP shop visits are now performed by a third-party channel partner. And CFM56 continues to be strong as well.

Larry mentioned in his prepared remarks about how we ended '25 retirements, which were similar to '24. And as we think about 2026, we expect retirements to be in the 2% range. Our prior expectations were 2% to 3% range. So trending a little bit better. And that puts CFM shop visits in the 2,300 to 2,400 range between '26 and '28. So external demand environment looks good. Shop visits, same thing. We're expecting double-digit removals this year from engines that they've already flown, plus the work scope continues to increase a little bit of price. So all that adds to that 15% growth that we mentioned on shop visits. So overall, feel good about the services outlook for '26.

The next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research.

Myles Walton
Wolfe Research, LLC

I was wondering on the LEAP breakeven, or LEAP profitability on the original equipment side. Are we crossing LEAP counted profit or breakeven in '26 still? And Larry, you must be feeling a lot better about the trajectory to get output on LEAP to 2,500 by 2028. What, if anything, is required from an investment within the supply chain, not the MRO network, but more the OE side of the supply chain still to get to where the manufacturers want to production rates...

H. Culp
Chairman & CEO

Well, Myles, from a new make perspective, and as you know as well as anyone, the supply chain that supports the new make also supports the aftermarket. So no one can really isolate the new make demand and invest for that without being mindful of the aftermarket demand as well. I think we have improved over the course of 2025, our visibility further out and deeper into the supply chain, further out time wise, deeper into the supply chain with respect to readiness to satisfy our needs to serve both the airlines and airframers. There will be capital investment in various places.

I'll let different suppliers and different commodity categories speak to their own plans. But I think we're confident that as we move forward here through the rest of the decade, we'll be able to satisfy what the airlines need in the aftermarket and with the airframers looking to do for the airlines as well, right, from a new delivery from a modernization and expansion perspective. But there's work to do. Again, I don't think we're going to be up 40% every year, not that we have to. But I feel very good that with the body work we put in for 2025, we're poised to step up again with the supply base be it process improvement, be it capital expansion and the like to keep pace with these considerable tailwinds that we're all fortunately exposed to.

Rahul Ghai
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And Myles, to answer your question on the LEAP profitability, yes, we expect LEAP OE to be profitable in 2026 as per our prior plans.

The next question comes from Douglas Harned with Bernstein.

Douglas Harned
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

On -- you talked about the improvement in turnaround times across the board, like LEAP, CFM56, GE90 by about 10%. And LEAP, I can see that. But CFM56, GE90, very mature engines. Is this turnaround time improvement, is that both for internal and third-party shop visits? And what levers enable you to do that? And if I can just add to that, how should we see that improvement reflected in financials since CFM56 is largely time and materials in GE90, you'd be on CSAs, I would assume.

H. Culp
Chairman & CEO

Doug, it is an internally oriented number, right? We watch CAT turnaround time closely at every one of our shops across -- platforms across the network. The way I think about CAT improvement, it's really driven by 2 things: one, material availability, and two, efficient execution of our standard work on the shop floor. We've talked a lot about supply chain. You've written about it as well. To the extent that we are getting not only more from our suppliers, but getting what we get in a more predictable way, the teams on the shop floor are better able to execute to bring down turnaround times. We talked about 3% year-over-year improvement from our priority suppliers. We talked about those suppliers delivering at a 90%-plus level to their commitments, takes a lot of noise out of the system.

That is an unlock for us, I think, to take full advantage of the process improvements by way of FLIGHT DECK that we've laid in the various shops. It's not equally spread across every shop, but those turnaround times, I think that you see improved in the fourth quarter, for example, really is a combination of better input materials and better execution. How does that show up in the financials? Well, we should be getting more shop visits completed in terms of the top line, but also we believe it's a considerable productivity unlock. If a team on the floor has to stop a shop visit if they are idle, waiting for a hard delivery, that's obviously unproductive time. If they have everything they need from induction to certification we will see, and I think I have seen the early signs of real productivity bumps there as well.

The next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank.

Scott Deuschle
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Rahul, can you quantify what the GE9X headwind ended up being in 2025? And then what the incremental profit headwind is from 9X in 2026? And then if you could comment on the quarterly earnings cadence you're expecting at CES in '26 as well, that would be helpful. So the question is around 9X losses in the earnings cadence.

Rahul Ghai
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So Scott, on 9X, our losses ended -- I mean, we said a couple of hundred million bucks of losses in 2025, and we've ended right about there. So right in line with our expectations. And for '26, as we previously said, we are going to ship more engines in '26 and the volume continues to grow up. And with that, our losses on the 9X programs will double year-over-year. So our current guidance for '26 incorporates those losses getting to that level. So all consistent with what we've said previously. On the first quarter, and let me just elevate the question a little bit, Scott, and just kind of speak to total company here, including CES. I mean, first, we expect a solid start to the year. As you probably remember, our output started out slow last year in the first quarter. So we expect our engine and shop visit output to grow substantially here in the first quarter. And that will drive our revenue growth.

And we expect kind of if you put all that together at the total company level, we expect high teens revenue growth for the company with both CES and DPT above their respective full year guidance. So the stronger start is going to come from both the segments. And now getting into the CES MAD services, we ended '25 with 27% orders growth. So we're entering '26 with a strong backlog and about 85% of the spare parts that -- the spare parts that we need to ship in the first quarter are already in the backlog. And then we had a CMR charge in first quarter of last year that we're not expecting to repeat. So it will be a strong start for our services business. And commercial equipment output will be strong. That will drive revenue growth. But if you -- first quarter last year was our strongest spare engine shipment quarter. So there'll be some impact from that here as we think about the year-over-year revenue growth, but still, it will be a strong revenue performance despite that.

And then there will be 9X shipments here in the first quarter as well, which we did not have in '25. And then DPT, they're on a good run here on sequential performance, expect that to continue, and that should drive revenue growth for the DPT segment. Now as we switch to profit, expect that profit to be up year-over-year growth -- up year-over-year, primarily from the services growth and the absence of the CMR charge that we took, which will offset the higher deliveries and the 9X shipments. But because of the lower spare engine ratio and 9X shipments, our total margins for the business will be kind of in line to slightly better or marginally better here versus where we ended fourth quarter of 2025. And free cash flow, we expect certain payments here in the first quarter. So free cash flow will be down year-over-year. But overall, as we think about revenue, we think about profit, we expect to get out of the gate here strong.

The next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.

Sheila Kahyaoglu
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Maybe Rahul, since you were just speaking about CES profit guidance for '26, if you could walk us through margins at the midpoint, it implies margins are flat. I know you gave a few pieces, the GE9X headwinds. How are you thinking about shipments there? What are you seeing offset the goodness to help overcome some of the mix issues you're facing with equipment growth outpacing services, 9X headwind, as you mentioned, spares ratio and just LEAP growing double digits while CFM is flat. How do we think about that?

Rahul Ghai
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I think, Sheila, you kind of outlined some of the key drivers here in the math. I think the margin story at the CES level is exactly the way you said it. Strong services growth here. We're expecting $3.5 billion of services revenue growth in 2026, which drops through at a healthy clip despite LEAP being a bigger share of that growth. We still expect strong drop-through from our services revenue improvement year-over-year. And then the OE shipments are increasing. The spare engine ratio gradually comes down as we expect it to as time passes on. and then 9X shipments and with R&D coming in as well. So I think those are the big drivers for the CES margins here in 2026. Now keep in mind that the margins ended up better than what we had expected back when we gave the October guidance. We -- the margins were about 70 basis points better than where we thought they will be in October world. So we have a higher jumping off point. And despite that, you see the -- as you said, our margins are expected to be flattish here in 2026. So we feel good about the trajectory that we are on.

Operator

The next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.

Seth Seifman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Maybe just to continue along that line of questioning, as we think about the headwinds that we know are accumulating from a mix perspective in CES and then we look out beyond 2026, how should we think about the margin trajectory there with LEAP OE becoming profitable, LEAP aftermarket continuing to become more profitable, but maybe OE aftermarket mix headwinds and more 9X. I guess the -- I'm getting to like a 26.6% in CES for 2026. And so kind of where do we think about that going directionally in the years beyond?

H. Culp
Chairman & CEO

Well, I think you captured some of the headwinds that we've talked about not only for '26, but for '28. I think it's important to recognize that when we spun, we thought we would be at a $10 billion operating profit level 2 years from here, right? So we're able to hit that milestone. We think we'll hit it at the midpoint here in 2026. So there's a lot of things that have clearly outweighed the headwinds. As we continue to grow the installed base and as we ramp with our suppliers, grow that installed base at a low to mid-single-digit level and get the full benefit of utilization in turn volume, work scopes and price, the commercial services business really will be, pardon the expression, the engine that drives the profit growth.

You talked about how LEAP will be better for us as we go forward. We'll certainly -- we'll look to have the 9X do the same. And all the while, we don't want to forget about the progress that we made in defense, right, where we were up 11% last year, top line operating profit up over 20%. So I think we have plenty of opportunity to deliver on that $11.5 billion of operating profit that we've talked about for 2028, potentially do better. But that's really the plan to continue to serve the airlines as best we can in the aftermarket, ramp with the airframers as they look to deliver to help the modernization and expansion programs from those same airlines all the while supporting the war fighters to the fullest extent of our ability.

Rahul Ghai
Senior VP & CFO

And so just maybe add a couple of things here. If you go back to July when we gave our '28 guidance, we said we expect 21-ish percent margins in 2028. Now we got there last year. So the jump-off point is substantially better than where we thought back in July so we're jumping off that higher point. And as even '26, we are maintaining that margin profile. So I think we're getting to the margin outlook that we had laid out for '28. Again, to Larry's point, not just on profit, but also on the margins. So that's a good trajectory. And I think we spoke about the CFM56 goodness here. Retirements are still trending low, shop visits in the 2,300 to 2,400 range now, which is maybe slightly better than what we thought back in July. And as you said, LEAP service profitability continues to get better with the external channel.

Larry mentioned the repairs that we are driving inside the company. We expect the number of repairs that are certified to continue to grow this year over '25. So that's helping. And with the incremental shop visits will drive productivity in the LEAP services as well. So all that points to the LEAP services tailwind kind of continuing here. So I think those will be the big levers along with continued strong performance on the wide-body program, especially GE90 as we think about the retirements are pretty much nonexistent there. So all that lends well to how we think about 2028. And clearly, it's a better margin profile than what we thought back in July.

The next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.

H. Culp
Chairman & CEO

Ron, are you there? Ron?

Ronald Epstein
BofA Securities, Research Division

Can you hear me? Sorry about that.

H. Culp
Chairman & CEO

Yes, got you.

Ronald Epstein
BofA Securities, Research Division

Yes. So yes, a lot has been asked already, but just coming back to your prepared remarks, you mentioned that you guys are spending, what, $3 billion a year on R&D. That's a big number. Can you maybe for lack of better cliches, double-click on that, maybe give us some feel for how you guys are spending that and what you're spending it on, where those investments are being made?

H. Culp
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Ron, I would say that in many respects, is where you would anticipate it being, right? Very much focused, first and foremost, on improving the customer experience with the engines that we are ramping. And we talk about LEAP in that regard. We want to make sure we continue to deliver improvements like the durability kit and the like to improve time on wing and to reduce the total cost of ownership. We've got the 9X coming under wing with the 777X. So it's those newer programs that are either headed to EIS or that are ramping that are really the first order, all the while we're making sure that we are investing in the future of flight. We've talked a lot with you in particular about our RISE program.

It's a technology development, not a product development program, but nevertheless, garners a big chunk of that annual spend. And then, of course, on the defense side, there are a number of next-gen programs that represent another meaningful portion of our R&D spend. So you put that all together, coupled with the field experience we have on that $2.3 billion flight hour experience base, we think we're well positioned to shape the future of flight. And as we move forward, we've talked a lot about the puts and the takes in '26 on the road to '28, rest assured, we're going to work very hard to protect and expand the size of the R&D envelope because we know this business is led through product cycles really on the back of innovation and technology. And that won't -- we can't let that change into the 2030s.

The next question comes from Gavin Parsons with UBS.

Gavin Parsons
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

You guys talked about CFM56 retirements trending lower than you expected, I think, at 2%, even though you're performing very well on LEAP deliveries. So curious if you're still expecting that to pick up to 3% or 4%. What's changed there? And if you still expect that shop visit peak in '27?

H. Culp
Chairman & CEO

Well, I think it's really, Gavin, more than anything, a function of demand that the airlines are trying to satisfy, right, which has them keeping the CFM56-powered planes in the air. And I think if we look at retirements in 2025, we ended up at about 1.5% of the fleet relatively in line with what we saw in '24. I think on balance, '26 is probably a little bit better for us, likely in the 2% range compared, I think, to a 2% to 3% range we offered up in July. So at this point, from a shop visit perspective, we think we're going to be in that 2,300 to 2,400 range through 2028. And that's -- it's better than what we said in July, where I think we were soft circling 2,300. So there'll be a gradual decline come 2030. But here in the next couple of years, given utilization, given demand, we think retirement is going to be a little bit more muted and the CFM56 is going to be stronger for longer, all good.

The next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.

Noah Poponak
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Could you elaborate on the agreement that's been announced with FTAI, what that means? What are the implications? And then, Rahul, on the free cash flow, you're now -- this year, you're going to fur with what you had provided for 2028. Anything abnormally high in '26 that has to fade? Or just how should we think about the bridge from '26 to '28 now?

H. Culp
Chairman & CEO

No, I would say just on the agreement, as you well know, we have an open third-party aftermarket. We think that open network has really been a strength for us over time. We want to make sure that customers have as much optionality as possible in how they service their fleets that clearly, in turn, supports both asset values and lowers cost of ownership. And that's really, I think, the foundation for what we've done.

Rahul Ghai
Senior VP & CFO

And I mean, on cash flow, Noah, nothing abnormal here in '26. The -- our challenge last year was inventory growth, right? I mean we added about a couple of billion dollars of inventory last year. And part of that is we the supply chain is getting better, but it's not all there. So we get some parts, but not everything. So that adds to inventory. And some of that is an investment that we are making to make sure that we can continue increase output in 2026. As we think about '26, we're expecting less contract asset favorability, and that is getting offset here with slower inventory growth.

So we added -- our total working capital in AD&A last year was about $0.5 billion of net headwind. And this year, we expect slightly less than that, which is not bad given low double-digit revenue growth that we're expecting this year. So really nothing abnormal coming through our cash number here and more opportunity on inventory as we get out and maybe slightly less on contract assets, which is all in line with what we previously communicated.

This question comes from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen.

Gautam Khanna
TD Cowen, Research Division

Congrats to Mohamed and Russell. Just wanted to ask on customer behavior in the aftermarket. Have you seen any change? Do you anticipate seeing any change in terms of scope of overhauls, either on wide-body engines or on CFM56? Any indication, any pricing pushback? I'm just curious, are you seeing any sort of discontinuity relative to what we've seen over the last couple of years?

H. Culp
Chairman & CEO

Nothing that really jumps out, frankly. Again, the demand environment post pandemic has been robust for the airlines. They need all they can possibly get from us and that's why we've talked so much about FLIGHT DECK and the supply chain over the last several years, particularly as it pertains to supporting the fleet they have while making sure they're also able to expand and modernize. We talked a few minutes ago about the CFM56 in all likelihood being more stable over the next few years. That clearly will creep into work scopes in certain instances, work scopes that will expand as the engines get older. But I would say on balance, -- we were with a lot of customers just this past weekend. They want more and they want it faster without any compromise with respect to safety or quality. It's a fair ask and one this team is committed to delivering on in the new year here.

Blaire Shoor
Head of Investor Relations

Larry, any final comments to wrap the call.

H. Culp
Chairman & CEO

Blaire, thank you. The hour flew there. I would just say to close, GE Aerospace remains a differentiated franchise defined by our enviable market position and FLIGHT DECK, supporting enhanced performance. As we look ahead, our outlook reflects confidence in our ability to deliver consistent value for our customers, shareholders and the millions of people who rely on our services and products every day. We appreciate your time today and your interest in GE Aerospace.
