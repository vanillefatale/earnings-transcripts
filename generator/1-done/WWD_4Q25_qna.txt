And our first question comes from the line of Scott Mikus with Melius Research.

Scott Mikus
Melius Research LLC

Chip, I had a question kind of on the aftermarket dynamics, particularly in engines. So the LEAP MRO network is much more internal relative to the CFM56 network. So when you ship a fuel metering unit component on the LEAP engine. Just how are you sure whether it's going to the aftermarket or OE channel? Are you being paid at different price versus both? Just given that GE and CFM more broadly is trying to route as many component sales through the LEAP MRO premier network?

Charles Blankenship
CEO & Chairman

So we're -- thanks for the question, Scott. We're sure about the PO status that comes to us, whether it's an install or a spare end item in terms of what customer is ordering it. So we have clear line of sight to what type of unit that is.

Scott Mikus
Melius Research LLC

Okay. And then given the investments that you're making in automation, when I was at the Rock Cut campus, it was very impressive there. Is there anything structurally that you see that would potentially prevent your LEAP or GTF aftermarket margins to where they couldn't potentially reach CFM56 or V2500 margin levels?

Charles Blankenship
CEO & Chairman

Well, Scott, there's nothing structurally in the way of that. It's kind of up to us to understand what the customers are seeing in the field with the units and developing the right repairs and overall procedures. And we're learning -- we've learned a lot with the first units that have come back, whether it be the pump or SCU or FMU on LEAP or it's the GTF fuel nozzles or actuation. So we're pretty confident that we have the right design for repairability and service solutions for our customers that we'll achieve the right profitability.

And our next question comes from the line of Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank.

Scott Deuschle
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Bill, what growth are you assuming for legacy narrow body engine aftermarket in 2026?

William Lacey
Executive VP & CFO

Scott, for you said legacy narrow body for...

Scott Deuschle
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

For narrow-body engines, yes.

William Lacey
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So we -- obviously, we saw a really good growth in '25. And based off of that, we would expect sort of single-digit growth rates coming through in 2026 on the legacy narrow-body. We expect to see some price obviously come through and volume at these levels will be tough. But the MRO shop surprised us last year, so we'll see if they get some more productivity. But I would say, single digit.

Scott Deuschle
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And then, Bill, does the EPS guide include any benefit of the recent share repurchase authorization increase? Or do you not really assume that authorization or repurchases -- excuse me, the guide?

William Lacey
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. We do expect and put that into the guide.

Scott Deuschle
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And then last question, Chip. Can you give us any sense as to how much your current power generation revenue is tied to Caterpillar? And I'd be curious if you could talk a little bit about the growth outlook you expect from that customer in the years ahead.

Charles Blankenship
CEO & Chairman

Well, we've been receiving pretty healthy growth from all of our power gen customers. And Bill and Dan talked about a little bit of reclass that went on. And it was really by examining where all of our customers and products were being used some traditional oil and gas customers have been involved in more power gen type applications, maybe not utility-grade but behind the meter type applications and folks like Caterpillar and NEO and Baker Hughes are all kind of playing in that segment of the market. So it's a very interesting aspect of the power gen growth opportunity that we're capitalizing on.

But as far as carving out just a single customer like Caterpillar, we don't do that. But I think you can be satisfied that as they grow, we grow, we're on some of their gas engines with SOGAV and valves and actuation and we're on some of their liquid fuel engines with actuation and governor products. So we've got a good staple of products distributed on their products, and it varies by application.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.

Unknown Analyst

This is Kyle on for Sheila. I hope that -- can you kind of extend the question here on the commercial aftermarket because I think you said muted next year. So you gave -- the prepared remarks are pretty helpful. I think you said LEAP GTF by the end of calendar year '26, the same size or larger than legacy. So when I take that in connection with the single-digit comment you just gave to Scott, I mean, I guess it implies that maybe the pull forward that you saw in this quarter and prior quarters is significantly larger than maybe I expected.

So maybe if you can just kind of walk through those puts and takes to round out that comment. What are you thinking about LEAP GTF growth next year in light of what the OEMs are saying and the magnitude of the pull forward that you saw this year and whether you're sure that's not repeating or whether there's potential that was actually restocking?

Charles Blankenship
CEO & Chairman

Yes. Thanks for the question. We really do believe there will be strong repair growth for LEAP and GTF. We believe like Bill was saying there'll be either flat to a little bit of repair growth on V2500 and CFM-5, But the thing, the big variable is this lumpy order behavior that we saw last quarter on spare end items, but pretty substantial demand there. And those are quite high-priced individual items to be ordered compared to repair.

So when you think about the total top line, it has an outsized effect on that top line as well as the earnings. So we don't forecast that happening again. There could be additional activity. We don't rule that out, and we're prepared to capture that if it shows up. But we -- I don't think it's prudent to forecast that or put that in our plan because we don't have any line of sight to that at this time.

Unknown Analyst

And if I could just follow up on the price comment, Bill, you said 5% next year. I assume that's more weighted to aerospace and increasingly weighted to aftermarket. So maybe any additional color by segment and by subsegment within that.

William Lacey
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Correct. At the total Woodward level 5% in the comments we talked about, the JDAM price increase in the fourth quarter '25, we'll see that flow through the first 3 quarters of '26. And so with that and some catalog growth, we will -- aero will outpace industrial slightly, but we still also will see good price results from our industrial team as well.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.

Noah Poponak
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Can you quantify in absolute dollars, whatever you're deeming to have been lumpy or pulled forward in the aerospace aftermarket in 2025 revenue?

William Lacey
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Noah, it's -- as you can imagine, it's hard to quantify because the customer isn't telling us exactly kind of their thought. But here, I'll give you a few numbers that will be in the footnotes of the 10-K. Back where we lay out by segment sales by region. And you'll see that from 20 -- from '24 to '25, sales grew $50 million. So some part of that $50 million is normal growth. And then some part of that is a part of this advanced purchases. It's just hard to quantify exactly.

Noah Poponak
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And can you quantify where LEAP and GTF aftermarket came in for the year 2025 versus 2024?

Charles Blankenship
CEO & Chairman

So the LEAP and GTF are gaining on the legacy, let's put it that way. And like I said before, they're kind of in the same ZIP code, but not equal. So -- and we're just talking repair activity, not including spare end items. So we really do think that that's going to cross over in the late '26, early '27 time period. And that may sound like an earlier crossover compared to what we said at Investor Day back in 2023. But that original graph in 2023, the legacy items that included some widebody and regional component repair and then it also in the new included GEnx.

So we're trying to strip out some of that other information and make it cleaner for you. Like last quarter, I committed that we would clarify that. And when we do run our model out and look at kind of how fourth quarter ended, how inputs are coming in for both the legacy as well as the LEAP GTF. That's how we come up with that sort of crossover period, which I hope clarifies things for you.

Noah Poponak
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. That's super helpful. And then just on the Aerospace segment margin, the guidance requires a pretty significant slowdown in the incrementals. I guess in the fourth quarter, you're seeing incremental benefits from the items we just discussed and therefore, it's sort of a leveling out over the 2 years? Or is there more to it?

William Lacey
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So the -- no, I think your question is about the incremental coming down from about 42.5 for aero and coming down in '26. And it's a few things. It's our OEM mix growing on the aero side, which is a mix down. And then, yes, the -- and so that's the main driver is just the amount of OEM that we expect to come through in '26.

Charles Blankenship
CEO & Chairman

And just a reminder about that is a good thing. So we're creating the installed base to get the services revenue and earnings on later.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.

Christopher Glynn
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Curious on the defense side, a specific and a general question. Where are you with guided weapons clarity longer term, how those programs and lot orders are flowing through? Should we anticipate that growth is kind of leveling off on a sequential basis? Or is the volume still ramping? I know you have a big price aspect to growth in that category?

Charles Blankenship
CEO & Chairman

So our guided weapons programs, Pearl, JDAM, small diameter bomb SDB and the team 9X are all kind of having a little different behavior. JDAM is up substantially, but we feel like that will remain level for a good while. And then we don't have any orders for the other 2, but we have indications that customers are asking us to do capacity studies and work with our supply chain and capacity studies. So some of these things are leading indicators that these other product lines might experience some growth opportunities. But we don't have anything specific, Chris, on that right now.

Christopher Glynn
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. And you mentioned global capacity investment for the industrial aftermarket. I'm guessing that's oriented towards the marine side, but just wondering if we could drilling to that investment element there.

Charles Blankenship
CEO & Chairman

Yes. So we've been doing a little bit of flag planting here and there on MRO shops. So when you think about a powerplant, and all of the scope of supply that we could provide to aeroderivative or heavy-duty frame power plant installations. Just like an aircraft engine, they undergo maintenance cycles, and we're finding that we have the ability to grow our service content with these customers when we're a little closer to that region.

So we've done some of that in the prior couple of years, and we anticipate doing a little bit more of it just to try and get closer to the customers. and grow the opportunity to service our fuel metering valves and other types of scope of supply like that, that are on our customers' gas turbines and as well, reaching out with the opportunity to do some repair and reciprocity engines.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Gavin Parsons with UBS.

Gavin Parsons
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Guys, what are you assuming for OE destocking? And it would be helpful if you could parse that out kind of by airframe and engine.

Charles Blankenship
CEO & Chairman

Thanks for the question, Gavin. It's a little difficult to parse that out for you that detail of a way from a customer standpoint. But we feel like, broadly speaking, somewhere in our second quarter sort of time period. If airframe customers and engine customers hit the rates and pull like they've forecast for us. We could be destocked by some time in that second quarter towards the end of our first half fiscal year.

Gavin Parsons
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then on CapEx going forward, should we kind of assume that normalizes once you finish kind of the A350 buildout? Or by the end of the decade? Or are we starting to look at build out for maybe a new single aisle?

William Lacey
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. For right now, Gavin, we'll say that the Spartanburg is investment is causing that peak. We're going to continue to kind of look through '27, '28, '29, and we'll give you a clearer view in December of what's out there. We're looking -- understanding our next single aisle investments. But right now, the Spartanburg is sort of what we see there on the near horizon.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities.

Michael Ciarmoli
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Nice results. Just to stay on Gavin's question there. The CapEx for Spartanburg. Can you support or will that have enough capacity to support programs beyond the A350? I mean is there kind of does this build out contemplate next-gen single-aisle.

Charles Blankenship
CEO & Chairman

Thanks for the question. The investment in Spartanburg, that facility has additional capacity over and above the A350 for us to put select product lines in there that make sense and are synergistic. But we're betting on a successful campaign for next single aisle scope, so that facility would not by itself be able to support NSA volumes.

We have bought enough land there to build a sister facility for NSA support. So we are thinking ahead where it makes sense on small amounts of investment dollars, but we're not putting any big investment dollars on NSA capacity. We'll have to really take a look at what that horizon and life cycle looks like from the design phase through the build and flight test phase and lay that out in comparison to our facilities and what's going on with legacy programs before we decide kind of how much additional capacity we need.

So that's a thought exercise even like Bill was saying, we'll share more at Investor Day in December. But some of that NSA thought exercise will mature as we understand from the Airbuses and Boeings of this world about what that time frame looks like.

Michael Ciarmoli
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Fair. And then just back to Noah's question actually. You were talking about incrementals, but I guess just absolute margins looking at the low end of the range, really no margin expansion. You're obviously hitting and exceeding the targets, and you talked about the OEM mix, which makes sense. But as you're seeing this ramp on LEAP and GTF, is there margin dilution there on services? I mean do you have to get over some learning curves? I mean, I'm assuming scrape spare sales would be highly accretive on those platforms. But is there anything else dilutive with the LEAP and the GTF ramp up there?

William Lacey
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I'll jump on that and Chip maybe cover me if I miss a part. But no, the LEAP GTF service margins are good. It really is the impact of the overall OE and how that impacts things. Obviously, on the low end of the range, it contemplates some other headwinds. But to the point about the LEAP GTF margins are good. Again, OE mix is a primary driver of our -- of the rate expansion that you're seeing in our guide.

Charles Blankenship
CEO & Chairman

Yes. I would just follow up and say that we intend to expand margins, and that's what you see a guide there that allows for some headwinds to get in the way of that intent. But we've got plans in place and programs and the automation benefit that we're planning some realization of for 2026. We intend to get productivity.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen.

Gautam Khanna
TD Cowen, Research Division

Just to elaborate on the first question, which we've written about before, which is this LTSA versus spot aftermarket dynamic on LEAP versus CFM. Is it -- do you guys -- I'm just curious like on CFM56, when you sell into -- a spare part into the GE network, I presume that's a lower price than what you would sell into if it's an MRO or airline outside the network? And does that same logic apply for LEAP when you're selling a spare part to a direct user like an airline versus when you sell it through the GE internal MRO network? And if that's true, why wouldn't there be structural differences in profitability between those 2 platforms in the aftermarket over time?

Charles Blankenship
CEO & Chairman

Well, the reason why there's no structural difference is because there's really no structural difference to the contracting, Gautam. And when we sell spare end items, it can be to an airline, it can be to an MRO shop that has a variety of people under different agreements. We have some asset management contracts with some of the bigger MROs just like us CFM or GE or Safran network. So the whole landscape is similar between the previous generation and this generation.

So when you think about repair, it's also the same thing. So whether it's the spare end item, spare parts or a repair, we have fairly similar contracting principles in the LEAP ecosystem that we do to the CFM-5. And so I think there's nothing really there to explore further except that we have a lot more LRUs to take care of.

Gautam Khanna
TD Cowen, Research Division

Got you. And then a follow-up on the mix dynamic within the aftermarket. I know you talked about repairs, and I think that's distinct from spares. So I just wanted to get a sense, is the overall aftermarket profitability next year a little bit softer than it was in '25, just based on kind of more repair, less spares? Or was there any nuance here that you were trying to convey?

Charles Blankenship
CEO & Chairman

Really no nuance to convey there. We have a good blended service earnings profile for 2026. We're pretty happy with that. We'll see if the spare end item, if more comes through than we forecast, like it did last year, I mean it's really hard to tell. We'll have some upside if that happens.

Operator

And our final question comes from the line of Louis Raffetto with Wolfe Research.

Louis Raffetto
Wolfe Research, LLC

Bill, how should we think about the return of capital to shareholders is going to be balanced across the year? Or is there any reason to think it will be skewed one way or the other?

William Lacey
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Louis, our point is to spread it out evenly through the year. We'll see how things go, but the plan is to stay in the market throughout the year.

Louis Raffetto
Wolfe Research, LLC

All right. And then I guess on FSG margins, the last several years, the first quarter has been, I would say, substantially below the rest of the year. Is that something we should sort of expect again here in fiscal '26?

William Lacey
Executive VP & CFO

I'm sorry, Louis, the margins in Q1?

Charles Blankenship
CEO & Chairman

We missed your first words.

Louis Raffetto
Wolfe Research, LLC

Sorry, FSG margins in Q1 have been below sort of the second quarter, third quarter? Should we...

William Lacey
Executive VP & CFO

I'm not quite sure we say FSU.

Louis Raffetto
Wolfe Research, LLC

I'm sorry. I mean aerospace process.

William Lacey
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. Yes, correct. That is normal trend in Aerospace and in Industrial, that Q1 is usually our lowest margin quarter and it sort of grows sequentially throughout the rest of the year.

Louis Raffetto
Wolfe Research, LLC

And then just last one on tax rate. You've had some benefit from option exercises in the last few years. I assume with the 22% rate, you're not expecting anything like that, but certainly could have that benefit depending on how that plays out?

William Lacey
Executive VP & CFO

That's exactly right, Louis. With the prices that we've seen over the last couple of years. And as we estimate out, we don't foresee that outsized tax benefit from option exercises. So that is what is behind that 22% effective tax rate.

Operator
