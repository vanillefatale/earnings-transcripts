Question-and-Answer Session


Leslie Garber
Director of Investor Relations

Okay. Great. [Operator Instructions] I will start the first question, which is from John Bair from Ascend Wealth Advisors. He says, Dr. Mervyn de Souza recently joined Oil-Dri to lead R&D efforts. What brought him to Oil-Dri? What are his vision and goals related to Oil-Dri R&D efforts and focus? And how do they align with Oil-Dri? Is there a particular R&D emphasis envisioned? Or is it balanced between agricultural, animal health and industrial product development. Mervyn?


Mervyn de Souza

Thanks, Leslie. Appreciate the opportunity to address your question, John. My vision and goals indeed do align with Dan's and the rest of the senior leadership teams to deliver innovation and create value from sorbent minerals while helping the company grow within our existing markets and develop new products for different applications.

I joined Oil-Dri for a couple of reasons. The major one was Dan's commitment to future growth as well as creating a culture where Oil-Dri teammates can grow and develop. Another reason was that Oil-Dri is vertically integrated to owned and leased mines. We produce the raw material used to make our distinctive products. And last but not least, the opportunity to work with an R&D team again, many of whom are listening in from our R&D innovation campus at Vernon Hills.

There's a lot of room for innovation and creativity when we go all the way from our mines to various global markets and that is a unique advantage that many R&D leaders and companies don't have. My R&D teammates have a diverse range of experiences and specialized expertise that we leverage when partnering with each Oil-Dri division and the GM to support their specific growth strategies, be it with cat litter, animal health, fluids purification or agricultural solutions. The R&D team supports all our Oil-Dri divisions, while our innovation processes and entrepreneurial culture allow us to flex resources the best and biggest opportunities across the company.


Leslie Garber
Director of Investor Relations

Great. Thank you so much. Our next question comes from Robert Smith, The Center for Performance Investing. And he asks, in what ways the current soybean situation affecting your business? And I'm going to have Bruce Patsey answer that.


Bruce Patsey

Robert, thanks for the question. The current administration has put more emphasis on tax benefits for renewable business with the use of soybeans in the market. So we do expect there'll be more crushing of soybeans and more oil going into renewable plants that will be processing this oil and turning it into diesel fuel. This will also probably generate more business at our current customers that are in the market as well. And we saw this in the fourth quarter as more soybean oil was being produced in the marketplace, and it helped drive some of our sales in the fourth quarter, and we expect that to continue in F '26.


Leslie Garber
Director of Investor Relations

Great. The next question is from Ethan Star. And both he and Robert Smith are interested in the future prospects for increased sales for both Amlam products in the upcoming year and for fluids purification. But I'm actually going to have Wade to talk about Amlan.


Wade Robey
VP of Agriculture, Oil-Dri Corporation & President of Amlan International

Thank you, Leslie, and thank you, Ethan, for the question. As many of you remember, in fiscal year '24, there was a general downturn in the ag industry. And certainly, the Amlan business and other of our agricultural businesses were impacted by that downturn, really driven by macro events that we built across the industry, not just in the U.S. but in our international markets as well.

In fiscal year '25, we saw good recovery. And again, that was across the industry, across our business, and that led to improved profitability for our customers. As a result of that, in fiscal year '25, we saw good growth and a return to more consistent growth as we had been forecasting previously. As we go into 2026, we expect that to continue. We still face regional challenges depending upon the geography in the world. Some of the economies are still recovering coming out of the pandemic. But generally, we've returned to more consistent and predictable economies that we sell into.

So going into 2026, we expect to see good growth across our businesses. Amlam is focused on continuing to expand into new geographies, both in Asia and in Latin America, adding new partnerships, adding new channels to the market. And so again, we expect a good year for the business, and again, more consistent growth that we can deliver. Macro events can change, but we don't see that necessarily on the near-term horizon. So that would be how we look at the coming year.


Leslie Garber
Director of Investor Relations

Thank you. Next question is from John Bair. He said you stated in the press release, competitors continue to increase their promotional spending during the 3-month period ending July 31, 2025, which Oil-Dri believes tempered its clay-based litter sales. Does this promotional activity refer to competitors' advertising activity as well as pricing discounts or couponing? Framing the question this way since Oil-Dri also stated advertising expenses were down in Q4, so wondering if lower advertising might have had an impact if competitors were advertising more heavily?

Laura Scheland, will you take that, please?


Laura Scheland

Sure. Thank you for the question. When referring to promotional activity in the release, we're mostly referring to heavy price discounts, couponing, trade spend at large retailers such as rollbacks at Walmart or Buy One Get One Free at Publix as well as other discounting and couponing in the brick-and-mortar and e-commerce channels.

During this heavy promotional climate in fiscal year '25, we shifted some of our advertising spend to strategic promotional trade spend, hence the reference to the lower advertising spend. We do not view this lower advertising spend as a driver for the tempered clay sales, but more strategic shift to kind of match what's going on in the market. As noted in the earnings release, we're seeing that the lightweight cat litter segment expanded and surpassed the growth of the cat litter category. And this was largely due to competitors' promotional spending on the lightweight products. While the competitive promotions can temper sales in the short term, the competitive spend on lightweight really helps drive consumer trial and educate consumers on the benefits of lightweight litter.

We've articulated over the years, our strategy of growing the lightweight litter pie as consumers learn the benefits of lightweight litter. All things being equal, from price and performance perspective consumers will want to buy lightweight litter. However, the concept of less weight, but the same amount of uses can be difficult to convey to consumers on package since litter sold by weight, but used by volume. Therefore, we see the promotional spending on lightweight as a positive development in the long term because we view the trend of the growing lightweight segment as a key driver for the advancement of our branded and private label litter.

So we remain focused on increased distribution and sell-in of our Cat's Pride and privately labeled lightweight litter products. We remain very excited about our prospects for growth, especially as promotional activity subsides, which we expect it will, as consumers remain budget constrained and look for really high-quality private label products and other value offerings.


Leslie Garber
Director of Investor Relations

Great. Next question from Robert Smith. I'm keenly interested in the prospect of using artificial intelligence in the innovation lab for R&D with respect to new product development. Can Dr. de Souza, please give us his thoughts about this?


Mervyn de Souza

Thanks, Leslie, and thanks, Bob. I, too, am excited about the potential for using automation and AI tools to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of R&D and innovation at Oil-Dri. That being said, I'm also a big fan of the crawl, walk, run philosophy. In my experience, the best outcomes are obtained when balancing automation with qualified human oversight.

Currently, this hybrid approach seems to be appropriate for Oil-Dri given deep minerals and application expertise that we have with teammates from both our R&D and operations team and the current state of AI technologies. For new product development AI can be used to quickly evaluate and then discard or elevate hypotheses, and it can screen a lot of data more rapidly than humanly possible. I've been at Oil-Dri for a little over 5 months now, and the team and I are in the process of critically reviewing existing data with a focus on quality as a first step, in addition to implementing processes to ensure that we generate technical information that is robust, reliable and reproducible. When working with AI and machine learning algorithms, garbage in, garbage out.

In the medium term, Oil-Dri is actively assessing advancements in machine learning models, not just for R&D, but also AI applications as they relate to excavation, hauling, crushing and processing our minerals. We acknowledge the disruptive and transformative potential of AI, not just within R&D, but across our business to help with efficiency, sustainability and value creation. At Oil-Dri, we are employing a phased and strategic approach when it comes to AI that allows us to evaluate the cost benefit analysis for Oil-Dri as a whole.


Leslie Garber
Director of Investor Relations

Great. Next question is from Tyler Ventura from Diamond Hill Capital. And he asked agricultural sales surged 104% in Q4 to a record $11.9 million. You mentioned normalized purchasing patterns and one new key customer. Can you provide more color on the sustainability of this growth and the revenue contribution from the new customer versus normalized patterns?

And Wade, I'm going to turn that over to you.


Wade Robey
VP of Agriculture, Oil-Dri Corporation & President of Amlan International

Yes. Thank you, Leslie, and thank you, Tyler. So this goes back a little bit to or relates directly to the answer I gave a moment ago to a previous question. In FY '24, we saw a pretty substantial downturn in the agricultural markets, and this impacted the entire industry. As I mentioned, a lot of international as well but also our businesses. And so in fiscal year '24, we did see reductions. And part of that was driven by agricultural practices. Part of that was driven by higher-than-normal inventories that had built up of products that farmers really use in broad acre production.

As we moved into 2025, so the last fiscal year, we worked through those inventories. We saw recoveries in the market and that resulted in not only our legacy or long-term customers expanding their purchases with us, but we also saw some new customers come on board with different types of applications. So fiscal year '25 was a real strong recovery year for us. As we move into fiscal year '26, some of that is going to normalize. We look to see growth in the ag sector this year, both in our turf and ornamental segments, but also in our broad acre segments as well, our row crop segments. And again, it will return to what I would call more consistent and predictable growth than we saw between '24 and '25, where we saw the significant drop and then the strong rebound.

Going forward, as we continue to see markets improve and become more technologically driven as we see population increase, as we see influence around the world increase and a desire to eat better and to have higher rates of animal protein, vegetable protein and diets. We see ag just continuing to grow on a consistent curve. Those will -- those macro events are going to impact our businesses very favorably, and that's why we're very bullish about this segment for Oil-Dri into the future.


Leslie Garber
Director of Investor Relations

Great. Next question is from Bill Anderson from Bard Associates. He would like an update on the Ultra Pet business. Laura, can you give a brief overview of that, please?


Laura Scheland

Yes. Thanks for the question. As Susan noted, we closed on the Ultra Pet acquisition in May of 2024, and it has been a great fit from a product, business, cultural and talent perspective. We are very pleased with the acquisition and really remain excited about the Crystal business and the synergies and opportunities that it adds to our business.

During fiscal '25, we leveraged our relationships with branded and private label customers and the expanded portfolio offering as well as synergies of being able to co-load our clay and crystal products together to customers to exceed our estimates of distribution adds, some of which came on in F '25 and some of which will continue in F '26.

So in addition, we've also exceeded goals of synergies with freight and operations and other costs and SG&A, which has helped offsetting some softness in the legacy customers that came on with Ultra Pet. So all in all, we remain really excited about the acquisition and the opportunities that it's allowing for our business.


Leslie Garber
Director of Investor Relations

Great. And we probably have -- we only have one more minute. So Dan, did you have any closing remarks?


Daniel Jaffee
Chairman, CEO & President

Sure. Look, our focus, you guys can tell from the team. I mean, when I used to run these teleconferences, it was like a one-man band. And now it isn't at all. And I'm glad you guys, you and investors get to hear from the people that are making it happen every single day, pulling together. We've always said winning at Oil-Dri is a team game, and that's what you're seeing here. Not every quarter is going to be as great as this one so let's enjoy it. And we're going to continue to do everything we can to create value from sorbent minerals.

So thank you for your support, and we'll look forward to talking to you after the first quarter.
