[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.

Brian Bittner
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Just as it relates to your '26 guidance for same-store sales down 1% to up 1%, you talked about how you anticipate comps to remain pressured in 1Q and then sequentially improve. Can you first talk about what are the main drivers of this improvement throughout the year? Is it comparison-driven or something else? And maybe you could help us understand how you are thinking about the shape of the recovery in '26, maybe first half versus second half so we can get -- all get on the same page with that.

Lance Tucker
CEO & Director

Brian, it's Lance. So first of all, we do expect the first quarter to be soft, as we've mentioned, and you guys see credit card data probably just like we do, so you're already aware of that. As we get into the second quarter, though, which for us begins in kind of mid-January, we'll be entering our 75th anniversary, where we have a number of pretty exciting things going on relative to ads and innovation and bringing back some old customer favorites.

We'll also -- we will have some softer compares, particularly as you get into the second half of the year, that will contribute as well. And then there are a number of kind of other things that we're doing. We'll be obviously working on the value equation and continuing to make sure that we've got the barbell strategy correct. We expect to continue to see sales benefit as we continue to improve on the operations side. Tech modernization, as you guys know, we've put a lot of time into tech modernization. It is ongoing, and I think it will build throughout the year and help us a little bit.

And then we do have, again, some interesting innovation coming. We have a new chef, a restructured kind of innovation team and structure that we think is going to drive some interesting things. So we have a lot of things that we're excited about as we go into 2026, but it's more calendar '26 comment than it is necessarily here in the first quarter.

Brian Bittner
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Okay. And just a quick follow-up is on the EBITDA guidance. I think you guys said the biggest wild card there is just as it relates to JACK on Track plan and as you execute against that. What's the assumption in the current EBITDA guidance? Is it for no real estate sales? And no block closures as of now? And then as those happen, that impacts the EBITDA relative to this initial guidance? Or how would you frame that dynamic up for us?

Lance Tucker
CEO & Director

No, we have block closures built in, first of all, to start with that piece. I'll let Dawn give you the exact number, but I believe looks like we've said 60 to 100 in total '26 closures. So that does include the closure program, as you would expect when you see that number.

And on the real estate sales side, we do have real estate sales. I think there -- we're a little bit limited in how fast we can go on the real estate sales because of the dynamics of how we're able to pay the debt back within the securitization, but there is between $50 million and $70 million of real estate sales built into that guidance number.

Dawn Hooper
Executive VP & CFO

That's right.

Your next question comes from the line of Alex Slagle with Jefferies.

Alexander Slagle
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

First, I just wanted to clarify on Brian's question and the commentary around the first quarter same-store sales trends. It sounds like a modest improvement versus the reported fiscal 4Q just given the cadence you talked about but then I guess some degree of slowdown recently. Is that the net-net for the first quarter-to-date? Is it similar to the 4Q? Or has it improved a little bit even after a few weeks of softer trends?

Lance Tucker
CEO & Director

Yes. I'd say we kind of -- as we got into the back half of Q4, we were seeing some improvements. As we entered the first quarter of '26, we maintained and we're probably seeing even a little bit of improvement beyond how we would exit Q4. The last few weeks, as we've not only gone over our own kind of stronger compares but also had some impact from the government shutdown, things have slowed down a little bit. They're normalizing again or beginning to normalize. I don't want to go into a lot more depth than that.

But again, when we kind of made the change to make sure we had some price point value and we've got things kind of at both sides of the barbell, the consumer has reacted better to that than what we were doing before. And I think you'll continue to see us run that playbook.

Alexander Slagle
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Got it. And the $5.5 million incremental marketing spend in the fourth quarter, you could kind of talk to if you're happy with the return you saw there and things you maybe do the same or different or if there's an opportunity to do more of that in '26.

Lance Tucker
CEO & Director

Yes. That's a good question. I can tell you -- first, let me kind of tell you where the spend went actually. So we did obviously spend behind our value and digital offers, and primarily that was the Bonus Jack that we brought in kind of at the low end of the barbell. And then we also pretty heavily spent against the $5 Smashed Jack for about a week within our app. That was actually tied to a sponsorship we had also invested in with part of that money, which was for a culturally relevant sporting event. That was the Crawford-Canelo fight, where we got really a lot of benefit.

So -- and then some of the spend also went to shortfalls. Obviously, our sales fell a little bit shorter where they would in the beginning part of the -- or where we thought they would in the beginning part of the year. And so when you think about that $5.5 million, think a portion kind of half or a little less was really going to make sure that we shored up our marketing fund and the remainder was incremental. That's the way I think about that.

As far as the benefits we got, we did see improved transactions. We also kind of got the opportunity to introduce a bunch of consumers to the best burger in QSR at a really good price point at $5, and then we made very significant impressions with 1 of our big demographic groups. So overall, would we consider doing that again? I mean our goal would be that we wouldn't need to do another significant contribution into the marketing fund because we would certainly expect that results are going to be better than what we saw in 2025.

With that said, I am happy with the results. I think Ryan would echo that. And if we needed to do something again, we'll always keep our options open.

Your next question is from the line of Sara Senatore with Bank of America.

Sara Senatore
BofA Securities, Research Division

I guess a follow-up question on the top line outlook and then a question on G&A. So the top line, I know your same-store sales guide is predicated on company-specific initiatives, and it sounds like you're very confident in those. Do you have any kind of underlying macro assumptions that you're making? I mean, we've seen -- I know you've talked about sort of exposure to different income cohorts. Anything that might signal, I guess, a sort of expectation that things improve in sort of the macro backdrop?

And then the G&A guide, I guess, it's flat on an adjusted basis. I just want to make sure I understand that the second half, is that more -- that will be lower. So is that the right run rate that the sort of lower G&A in the second half is actually the right run rate and so perhaps a little bit below that 2.5% of system-wide sales. It's just the first half is more -- you might still have some stranded costs or still be working on restructuring, so as a go-forward basis.

Lance Tucker
CEO & Director

Sara, I'll take the first one, and then I'll ask Dawn to pitch in on the G&A question. But relative to kind of the macro conditions, really, the assumptions we've made are certainly that is not going to going to get any worse but that it's going to remain pretty flat kind of throughout the year. We didn't build in a significant tailwind from anything going on in the environment that would necessarily be a benefit. So the numbers you kind of see are largely a status quo is what I would say. We've seen just the slightest bit of sequential improvement kind of both in the low income cohorts and in the Hispanic cohorts but still a lot of work to do on both, and so not enough that we felt comfortable building any tailwind into that guidance.

Dawn, on the G&A, I'll let you run with that piece.

Dawn Hooper
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And on the G&A, you're exactly right. As we rightsize the business and we exit the TSA and eliminate those stranded costs, you're going to see Q2 -- the second half of the year come in, in like the 2.3%, 2.4% range, which would be more realistic going forward.

Operator

Your next question is from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.

Jeffrey Bernstein
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great. My first question is just on franchisee sentiment. Lance, you mentioned the category is more competitive than ever, and currently, I know you're running similar to peers, but large negative traffic. Just wondering how those conversations are going as you focus on kind of more singular brand, asset-light model. Maybe what are they asking for? Are they still showing willingness to invest in the JACK on Track plan? Kind of any broader sentiment you can share since you are a, again, a primarily franchise business model and there's lots going on there, but profitability is likely under pressure? And then I had one follow-up.

Lance Tucker
CEO & Director

Sure. And you're right. I mean, when you have a difficult year like we had in 2025, that does, in fact, put pressure on franchisee P&L. What I would tell you is the kind of sentiment and what we're hearing from them. First of all, they want the same things that we want, right? They want sales to be positive just like we do. We want them to be positive tomorrow. And so yes, of course, we hear that, and it's understandable.

When the sales are difficult and the bottom line results are difficult, the conversations are going to get more pointed. But again, that's kind of what you expect. And while they're pointed, they're also respectful. And they also are willing and able to support the team and support the brain, and they're doing everything they can on their side as the primary operators of their restaurants to drive our results.

And so look, we spend a lot of time talking to franchisees. We listen to them. We don't always agree, and I suspect that's the same across most systems. But with that said, we assume their positive intent, and they assume our positive intent. And so we are working together to try to drive the business forward.

As far as investing, I do think, as we get towards the end of the year, and I said this in the prepared remarks, I do want to be rolling out some sort of -- some kind of reimage program. I think we're going to need to do a comprehensive reimage program, and that needs to start sooner rather than later. But as we also mentioned, we are testing kind of a mini reimage that would be much more affordable, get out there very quickly and bring some instant kind of modest benefit to the brand until we get to a point where we can do a broader reimage because franchisees with the financials, where they have been for the last year, will need a little more time before they're going to be in a position probably to reinvest in the brand the way we all want to.

So kind of a long answer to your question but I guess I want to kind of end with 2 things. We do still have nearly a $2 million overall AUV within our franchise community. And so yes, when you get to some of the smaller franchisees and some of the less well-capitalized franchisees, there are some pressures, and there's pressures across everyone. But it still overall is a pretty reasonable picture.

And then we're actually going to be out, the executive team is in December doing kind of road shows in several markets to talk to franchisees, and they hear what they have to say. And make sure that we're being as transparent with them as we are with you along this call. So a lot of conversations.

Jeffrey Bernstein
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Understood. And then just the follow-up, as we look past the transition to a single brand, asset-light model, presumably maybe we're thinking more like fiscal '27. But just as you look out, like what are the reasonable assumptions that you think about for top and bottom line even if it's directional only? I know unit growth gets the most attention because there's often talk about an acceleration in that growth and having a national footprint 1 day. But how do you think about that directional trend over the next number of quarters or years or however you think about it in terms of top and/or bottom line growth for the Jack story?

Lance Tucker
CEO & Director

Sure. Yes. Well, first of all, we'll give long-term guidance once we're a little further into the JACK on Track program. I would -- I'm not going to put an exact time frame on that, but I would tell you, we realize the need to go out and update that long-term guidance sooner rather than later. Obviously, in the meantime, and you kind of referenced this, the unit guidance number that's out there, given the closure program that's going, is a number I wouldn't pay a lot of attention to.

I think as you think about the long-term algorithm, I mean, I think it's not going to be too far off, I don't believe, from what you would expect, which is to say asset-light model, primarily franchise openings, reduced CapEx, moderate G&A by low single-digit comps. We are going to want to get into a growth story on the unit side. That's probably a couple, 3 years away. We'll give better guidance on that when that happens.

And then kind of responsible unit openings with units that have really good overall unit economics. We are driving cost out of the building right now. We need to continue to do that before it makes sense to be out building just a whole lot. So we'll give more firm long-term guidance, as I said here, when we're a little better positioned to do so. But with that said, it's not probably an atypical algorithm than what you would have expected.

Next question is from the line of Gregory Francfort with Guggenheim.

Gregory Francfort
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

I have I guess 2. The first is you made a comment a couple of questions ago about maybe holding off on bigger remodels and doing smaller remodels in the near term. I guess if the stores need larger remodels, why would you do that? And would you consider maybe instead raising equity capital if these are the right things to do from either reimage or your struggling franchisees you need to buy in? Is that something that's on the table here? Then, I have a second question.

Lance Tucker
CEO & Director

No, I would not expect we would be doing an equity raise, so I'll largely put that one to bed. I think we're going to have plenty of franchisees that are able to go full speed ahead with the more comprehensive reimage. But I think we are going to need to have an alternative for those that are not.

So I'll reframe my answer just a little bit and say I do expect at the end of the year to be moving forward with a full on reimage program. But I think we do need to make sure that we've got programs that are attainable for everyone. And as I said, when we were talking about kind of franchise health, I think, by and large, we're going to have a large number that would be able to move ahead and plow ahead. But we are going to need to make sure we have some options that give some relatively modest to median impact while giving the franchisees time to plan for those expenditures going forward.

Gregory Francfort
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Okay. That's helpful context. And then just the other question I had was on value scores. There's, I guess, a debate in the industry that some of the softness might be just the consumers balking at higher prices for a lot of brands just because labor costs were up a lot. I -- have you seen your value scores more recently change either for the better or for the worse? Just any thoughts on the direction of where that stands and where you want it to be?

Lance Tucker
CEO & Director

Yes, we actually have seen our value scores increase a little bit. And by the way, you're hearing the same thing, I believe, we think and that we all think. I mean there is just an overall feeling that prices are too high out there, though with some of the pivots that Ryan and team made on the marketing side and I think you'll continue to see some improvements in our scores as we move forward given what we have planned for the calendar, which is to make sure that we do have kind of at that more value end of the barbell that we make sure we do have some good choice out there while also having some things at the more premium or [ above net ] value side as well.

Operator

Your next question is from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS.

Dennis Geiger
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I wanted to come back to that value topic again. And maybe, Lance, just if anything else, it's great to see the value scores are improving some. Could you share sort of where maybe value incidence was in the quarter or if it had been improving through the quarter? As you mentioned, sort of value was driving some improvement in the trends.

And then I'm sure you don't want to give too much away. But as it relates to next year, maybe where are some of the biggest gaps? Clearly, the barbell approach but some of the biggest opportunities from a value perspective in '26, is there anything to share a high level there?

Lance Tucker
CEO & Director

Yes. So we don't typically share the absolute kind of value scores. I can tell you, particularly as we got into the second half of Q4, though, it was sloped upwards. I don't want to get into a whole lot more detail than that. And then as for next year, I think from my perspective, and I'll ask Ryan to jump in here when I'm finished, if he has anything to add, but I think the biggest thing we need to do is be consistent with value and make sure that we have something at the -- at kind of both sides of the barbell that we try to play in so that the consumer always knows, hey, I can go get some price point of value if I need to. That is not the place where we want to build all our sales. It's not the place where we want to drive the business. But we do recognize that we've got to consistently be there with some fresh innovation and some -- frankly, some good value literally every window, every week.

Ryan, am I missing anything?

Ryan Ostrom
Executive VP & Chief Customer & Digital Officer

Yes, that's correct. It's making sure we have that consistent bottom bell part of the barbell strategy on value, and that is something we've kind of missed in a few windows before. So as we're looking at our '26 calendar, we are making sure that consistently shows up in our messaging and marketing.

Dennis Geiger
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Terrific. One more then, if I could, maybe just another on remodels or the reimage program. Is there currently a prototype? I know over the years, there have been various prototypes, Lance. It seems like you're still kind of working through what the more comprehensive reimage prototype will be. So I just wanted to confirm that.

And then maybe if there's any context that you provide, looking back historically on -- we've seen that, I believe, some fits and starts as it related to a remodel program. And just looking back relative to the go forward on why going forward, there's going to be strong demand to get this done and what will be different over the coming years maybe than looking back as it relates to getting the reimage done.

Lance Tucker
CEO & Director

Sure. So first of all, yes, we do, in fact, have an image. I mean we still are tinkering a little bit around the edges, but we have reimages, frankly, in process right now. It's not as big a full-scale program, but the kind of the crave package and the reimage packages that we have, we're actually very happy with. The real change from my perspective is making sure that we've got the right contribution coming from the company for those and making sure if there's an aspect or 2, we want to make sure that we're really focused in on that we're getting those done in these reimages.

So there are certain things that if the company is going to put in significant dollars, we want to make sure are present in these reimage packages. And you can imagine what those things would be. They'd look like the drive-through. They'd look like signage. They'd look like some form in all likelihood of a digital menu board, whether a hybrid or a full.

So there's things that we want to make sure focused on the gas and focused on driving sales. They're going to be more important. So we're still thinking with a little bit around that -- with that around the edges. But generally speaking, yes, we do actually have the image, and we're happy with it.

As far as -- there have been fits and starts, and that's actually a good way of saying that. The reality is we haven't done a full on reimage in a number of years. And I think there's -- probably the biggest singular difference that I'm going to tell you that I see going forward is going to be leadership focus. So this is something that we're going to have to focus on and do. It's just been too many years. In all the data we get, it shows up strikingly that we're losing on the appearance of our buildings. And we've kind of gone to the point where we just almost have to do this. So that is why it's an initiative for me. I just, frankly, have to make sure from a company standpoint that we're a little further along in JACK on Track and have the kind of the cash to pay down the debt first, and then we can start with some pretty significant contributions on the company side.

But we're going to drive this as one of our very top priorities, if not, our top priority once we kind of get beyond JACK on Track. And so that is, I think, going to be the primary difference you see versus what you've seen in the past.

Next question is from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.

Brian Harbour
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I had just sort of a bigger picture question. What -- in the work you've done, I mean, what is it that you think customers want out of Jack right now? I mean you made the comment yourself that people are very selective, and so I think there's relatively few brands that are kind of taking share in that environment. So what is it that you think would really move the needle with your customers over the next year?

Lance Tucker
CEO & Director

I think when you think about Jack in the Box, one of the things you think about, we've always delivered a solid value, and we've always delivered a lot of innovation and variety. And so I think we're in a unique position to make sure that we can deliver kind of satisfying meals at a good value and some innovative things that you can't find just everywhere. And that's everything from breakfast 24 hours to a lot of our side items like your curly fries or your egg rolls or churros or certainly, Two Tacos, which we're most famous for.

So I think the consumer is looking for that. And I think the consumer is also looking for a little bit better experience from us. And that's where, I think, from an ops improvement standpoint, we can really make inroads quickly. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Shannon and team on the offside, we've done some restructuring. We're going to have people out there training much more than they have been. We're going to have a lot more field presence to make sure that we're delivering on that better ops experience. So a little bit of a long answer to your question, but that's what I think we can deliver.

Brian Harbour
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes, that makes sense. I guess I was going to ask about that, too. I think -- did you pick up like -- is it like a quality perception gap that you think has emerged maybe as a result of some of those inconsistencies? Or what do you think needs to be done better there?

Lance Tucker
CEO & Director

I think there are kind of 2 or 3 things. So to answer your question directly, I don't think our quality perception is as high as we think it should be, and there are steps that we need to take to fix that. So one of them is ops improvement. And again, it's just making sure that we're giving a good, consistent, friendly, what we call joyful experience to the consumer every day. We need to make sure the accuracy is there. We need to make sure that as they're coming through the drive path that the restaurant is clean, that the drive-through looks good. We need to make sure we have the right innovation and all those things kind of wrap into quality perception.

And so yes, we have kind of picked up that we don't think we're getting the credit we think we should. Some of that's self-inflicted. Some of that is just a lot of things that we need to do better, and so that's why you see us focusing on our innovation. That's why you see us focusing on wanting to clean these drive paths up and do some work on the buildings themselves and certainly, why what you see us focus on this, make sure we've got the right ops experience because that's better than any marketing you can do. You get people the right experience to get hot burger, prepared the way they want it in a reasonable amount of time. They're going to come back. It makes Ryan and team's marketing job much easier.

Your next question is from the line of Andrew Charles with TD Cowen.

Andrew Charles
TD Cowen, Research Division

Dawn, just one housekeeping and then my real question. First, can you comment on what your franchisee store level cash flow was in '25 and the change versus '24? The quick math just looking at company stores is about a 15% decline year-over-year, but hoping you can confirm that's aligned with the system.

And then my real question for Lance or Dawn is what cash-on-cash return are you going to target from the smaller scope remodel. And really, how can franchisees fund these just given the challenged state of industry cash flows?

Dawn Hooper
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So I'll take the franchise profitability first. We don't disclose that, but it should be in line with what you're seeing on the company side. I wouldn't expect it to be different.

Lance Tucker
CEO & Director

And then on the cash-on-cash returns, I mean, we're talking very modest investments here of under 20,000 -- under 25,000 depending on if you -- depending on what you're doing. So those certainly in the -- even in the context of a difficult year, whether it's for us or anybody in the industry, we're talking very modest kind of investment here, more of a spruce up if you want to think about it that way. And that's the kind of thing you put -- you do it the right way. You put just a little bit of marketing behind it. You would expect low single digits. You're not expecting huge returns on that, but you are expecting kind of a pretty modest return.

Your next question comes from Logan Reich with RBC Capital Markets.

Logan Reich
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Just on the Jack in the Box company-owned store, same-store sales relative to the franchisee, it looks like company stores are outperforming the franchisee base. Is there anything behind that? It looks like compares got a little bit easier on the company stores, but I'm just wondering if that's a result of some of the operational changes you guys are making and not showing up in the company-owned restaurants first or if there's something else you would attribute the outperformance to.

Lance Tucker
CEO & Director

I'll start, and I'll let others jump in if there's more to add. But certainly, there was a little bit on the compares. I also think, over time, that the company's pricing probably has looked a little more favorable than franchisees in a lot of ways, meaning franchisees are, generally speaking, taking more price. So our absolute pricing at company restaurants right now is a little bit below many franchisees, not all. But we think given the markets where we have company restaurants head to head with franchisees, that's what we're attributing most of the difference there.

Next question is from Jim Sanderson with Northcoast Research.

James Sanderson
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

Just trying to look more closely at your current performance and the outlook into fiscal '26. Maybe you can provide some learnings on what worked best that generated that sequential 300 basis point improvement in comp, if that was a consumer reaction among any specific income levels, regions, dayparts, any texture on what really worked well relative to the promotions you offered.

Lance Tucker
CEO & Director

Yes, Jim, I think more than anything else, we really came out of third quarter and started fourth quarter with not quite enough price-pointed value. I mean the biggest singular driver of that move by far was when we pivoted and put dollars behind the Bonus Jack and more price-pointed value.

When you think about geographies, there weren't great differences in geographies. There weren't great differences in the various income or other demographic cohorts for that matter. I think it really was just a matter of we had a lot of abundant value and we thought what we had was good value, and I still believe it was. But it wasn't price pointed. It won't bringing people in as much. So when we made that switch, that's what drove that 300 basis point change.

James Sanderson
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

Okay. And then just a follow-up on the discussion of kind of long-term outlook and cash on cash returns. How do you see the store margins at Jack in the Box evolving? They're quite a bit lower than they were pre-pandemic. Is there a new normal out there related to store labor and new stores, things like that, that might adjust what we should expect out of the store going forward?

Lance Tucker
CEO & Director

I would expect certainly improvement from what we saw here in the fourth quarter. We opened the Chicago market. We opened 8 restaurants in a span of 8 or 9 weeks and frankly, really kind of overstaffed those. Particularly with it being a brand-new market to us, we wanted to make sure we were providing really good service. So -- and we overstaffed them to a degree. It actually did kind of move the overall consolidated labor number and restaurant labor margins. So -- our restaurant margin rather.

I do think, as we move forward, we're working on our supply chain. We are working on labor initiatives. So I would expect it to improve. I don't have the 2019 or '20 numbers in front of me to tell you it is or isn't a new normal. What I can tell you is I would expect improvement in restaurant level margin, both for us and our franchisees.

Your final question comes from Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities.

Jake Bartlett
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

My first was on Jack in the Box performance versus peers. I think, clearly, you're underperforming, but I'm wondering whether in your core California market, there might just be general pressure and you're not underperforming as much as I might have seen by looking at the national numbers. So if you can frame out how you're performing versus peers and then I have a follow-up.

Lance Tucker
CEO & Director

Yes. I think versus peers, we certainly, as we started fourth quarter, I think we were lagging more, and then we closed that gap as we got towards the end of the fourth quarter. Again, I hate to keep beating a dead horse, but as we adjusted what we were doing a little bit, so I think that we're certainly closing that gap. When I think about California versus the rest of nation, California itself is, I think, a struggle among many, many brands. And so I have a feeling that we would be certainly no worse off in California and probably a little better off than when you compare national to national just given the concentration we have.

Jake Bartlett
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then my follow-up was on you mentioned some of the moves you're making to increase affordability and you mentioned lowering or tweaking some of the combo pricing, increasing the size of the drink in the small combo. The question is about the franchisees' willingness to make those moves. Other brands that have done similar things have had to kind of really make some deals with the franchisees and incentivize them to do so, so encouraging that it sounds like they're agreeable to doing something like that. So that's one part of it.

And then the next part is just whether that should continue. Are there other opportunities you see within '26 to meaningfully increase the affordability within the -- maybe even the core offering?

Lance Tucker
CEO & Director

So I would say on the franchisee side, they have, in fact, been willing to make the moves that we've talked about. They were very onboard with the cup change. They were onboard with making sure that we had some price-pointed combos that were in the area they need to be in, in order to make sure that we're staying competitive. So we really did not have to -- it's not that we didn't have discussions and every franchisee is a little bit different. But with that said, by and large, we really didn't have much pushback on that front. So I think I can confidently say they were -- it's not 100% onboard. They were largely onboard most certainly with making those changes. And then what was the second part of your question, Jake, I'm sorry?

Yes. Just whether you're going to do more of that sort of thing in '26, whether increasing affordability of the core menu is something that you're going to still try to build upon.

I believe that, first of all, something you're always evaluating, you're making sure that you think you're in a relevant price point for the consumer you're trying to reach. I think there's probably some places where we could reduce prices, probably a few places we could take price to. So as we look into '26 and kind of our menu pricing strategy, I think, from my perspective anyway, we'll be looking are there a few more price points we need to have out there that are eye catching, so to speak. But then again, for every one of those, I would expect there's going to be a couple of places that we can smartly take price to where you wouldn't see a huge impact on the P&L.
