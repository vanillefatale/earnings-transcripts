Hello, everyone. In Q3, Baidu Core reported total revenue of RMB 24.7 billion, AI Cloud revenue reached RMB 6.2 billion, increasing 21% year-over-year sustaining value growth momentum. Apollo Go's growth accelerated sharply. We delivered over 3 million fully driverless operational rides in Q3, representing 212% year-over-year growth, up from 148% last quarter.

This quarter demonstrated how AI is driving transformative value across our business. From enterprise services to consumer-facing products to smart mobility, our AI capabilities are delivering proven tangible impact at scale. Starting with the enterprise side, where our AI Cloud business continues to scale with healthy momentum and deliver measurable business impact.

In Q3, AI Cloud continued its strong growth trajectory. Within AI Cloud, the areas most central to AI achieved the fastest growth. In particular, subscription-based revenue from AI accelerator infrastructure surged to 128% year-over-year, becoming the primary driver of AI Cloud's expansion.

This reflects both a healthy shift towards a more recurring, structurally healthier revenue model and the strong demand for our AI products and solutions. Our ability to serve this growing demand stems from our early and strategic deployment across Baidu's full stack in AI architecture, spanning infrastructure, framework, models and applications, which allows us to support enterprises at every stage of their AI journey.

At the infrastructure layer, our AI infrastructure is among the most advanced in China powered by a diverse mix of domestic and international high-performance computing resources, including our own self-developed AI computing architecture. Through continuous technical innovation, we drive performance and efficiency improvements while consistently reducing inference costs. Additionally, our industry-leading resource management capabilities significantly boost utilization and scalability.

These advantages make our AI infrastructure reliable, scalable and highly cost effective for enterprise clients. And the model layer, we feature our self-developed early foundation model, which continues to iterate rapidly. At the recent Baidu World 2025, we unveiled ERNIE 5.0, our first native omni-model, foundation model with exceptional performance in omni-model understanding, creative writing and instruction following.

ERNIE not only represents the cutting edge of our AI technology, but also serves as a backbone behind much of the AI-driven innovations across our businesses. At the application layer, we have a range of AI applications tailored to enterprise business needs.

Let me share some examples. The first is [ Famou ] or FM agent, a self-evolving agent, we recently launched that significantly improved enterprise efficiency; built on ERNIE, it autonomously explores countless possibilities and continuously evolve its strategies to identify best solutions for highly complex, constantly changing real-world problems.

FM agent is now deployed across industries including transportation, energy, logistics and ports, optimizing complex operations that traditional approaches struggle to handle. Its capability is particularly valuable in China, where we have diverse industrial sectors with numerous scenarios demanding efficiency improvements, when you can meaningfully boost efficiency across such varied use cases, the social impact is profound.

Another example is the Daniel Wu English coach, an ERNIE powered digital employee we created for Yashi Education, featuring the lightness of the well-known actor. It enables users to engage in one-on-one real-time English conversation practice anytime, anywhere. This directly addresses a key challenge. Yashi's users require frequent on-demand speaking practice, which is difficult to scale with human instructors.

The digital employee provides unlimited availability and an immersive engaging learning experience. Besides enterprises, our AI applications are creating value for individuals by enhancing productivity. Baidu Wenku and Baidu Drive, our largest AI applications for individuals, have been revitalized with AI. Their combined MAU has approached 300 million. In August, Wenku and Drive jointly launched a general-purpose AI agent platform that orchestrates hundreds of specialized agents to complete complex end-to-end tasks through simple natural language interactions.

The platform has gained strong traction since launch, demonstrating how AI can meaningfully enhance personal productivity at scale. In the physical world, autonomous driving exemplifies the transformative value of AI, unlocking new possibilities for mobility, safety and efficiency.

In Q3, Apollo Go's growth significantly accelerated to new heights. During the quarter, we provided over 3 million fully driverless operational rides to the public, representing a remarkable 212% year-over-year surge compared to 148% growth last quarter.

In October, weekly average fully driverless operational rides exceeded 250,000, marking one of the highest levels achieved in real-world Robotaxi operations globally. To date, our fleets have accumulated over 240 million autonomous kilometers with more than 140 million of those being fully driverless, maintaining an outstanding safety record throughout. Achieving this rapid expansion while delivering exceptional safety performance is a powerful validation of our technology's maturity and operational capabilities.

We are proud to see our decade-long commitment to autonomous driving now bearing fruit in large-scale operations. Reaching this scale requires maturity across multiple fronts, advanced technology, a rigorous and widely recognized safety record, demonstrated business viability, deep operational expertise and the ability to expand rapidly.

These years of unwavering investment have not only given us a first-mover advantage, but more importantly, have built comprehensive capabilities that position Apollo Go as the undisputed global leader in this field.

With this strength, Apollo Go has now entered a phase of rapid global expansion. As of October, Apollo Go's global footprint expanded to 22 cities, an increase from 16 last quarter. In October, Apollo Go entered Switzerland through a strategic partnership with PostBus, the country's leading public transport operator. Together, we plan to launch autonomous ride-hailing services in Eastern Switzerland, representing a key step in our European market expansion and another milestone in our global journey.

In the Middle East, we secured one of the first fully driverless commercial operation permits in Abu Dhabi recently and deepened our collaboration with local partners. In Dubai, Apollo Go was granted exclusive authorization to conduct self-driving trials on open roads at the fourth Dubai World Congress for self-driving transport in September.

RT6 provided trial rides to global attendees, including government officials, business leaders, media and investors, showcasing our technology's maturity on an international stage and demonstrating our global leadership. In Hong Kong, where Apollo Go has established by far the strongest presence in right-hand drive Robotaxi markets, we expanded our open road testing zones to include Kolon and Kung Tong District recently, further strengthening our position in the strategically important market.

These milestones spanning Europe, the Middle East and Asia validate both our technology's adaptability and our ability to partner effectively with leading local operators in different regulatory environments.

Looking ahead, we will expand to more markets with strong commercial potential and partnership opportunities, maintaining our unwavering focus on safety and operational excellence as we work toward making smart mobility widely accessible. In our mobile ecosystem, agents and digital humans represent AI-native monetization innovations that are transforming our online marketing business, creating substantial value for advertisers through higher engagement, better lead conversion and stronger ROI.

Our agents help advertisers effectively clarify user intent through intelligent multi-round conversations and quickly find out the most relevant high-quality sales leads. This ensures advertisers receive more precise and qualified leads compared with traditional approaches.

Building on this capability, agents have evolved into multiple forms; tech-based, voice-enabled and visually-embodied digital humans, each designed to address different scenarios and interaction needs. Such versatility enables advertisers to choose the most effective format for their specific use cases, achieving broader scenario coverage and higher conversion efficiency. As a result, agents have gained strong traction across diverse industries, including healthcare, business services and lifestyle services.

In September, around 33,000 advertisers generated ad spending through our agents on a daily basis. Digital humans also saw strong momentum. Powered by ERNIE, our digital humans provide 24x7 AI-powered live streaming for advertisers at low cost, making professional live streaming accessible across more scenarios and industries.

The technology continues evolving, delivering greater realism, more natural interaction and real-time engagement with viewers. This enables performance that surpasses human hosts in many cases, making our digital humans increasingly attractive to advertisers.

Adoption has broadened beyond merchants to sectors such as healthcare, automotive and legal services. We are seeing both existing clients increase their budgets and new clients rapidly coming on board. In September, the number of digital humans live streaming on our platform almost tripled year-over-year, underscoring quick adoption across industries and growing monetization potential.

These innovations are already generating significant revenue with fast growth rates. In Q3, combined revenue from agents and digital humans reached RMB 2.8 billion, up 262% year-over-year, validating the strong market appetite for our AI native monetization approaches.

Looking ahead, we see substantial opportunities to scale these innovations further, broadening adoption across more verticals and deepening penetration with existing advertisers.

Now let me review the key highlights for each business.

In our AI Cloud business, our client portfolio continued to improve in Q3, demonstrating deeper collaboration across the board. Leading enterprise clients increased spending and expanded usage beyond AI infrastructure. Mid-tier enterprise clients delivered healthy growth with both subscription-based revenue and client count rising.

Several key verticals saw strong momentum. In embodied AI, our client base expanded to 35 from 20 last quarter, covering nearly all major industry players in China. The automotive vertical also delivered strong growth with revenue nearly doubling year-over-year.

In addition, this quarter, we entered into new collaborations with leading players, including Neolix, a major provider of autonomous delivery vehicles in China. Collectively, these results affirm the broadening adoption and strong recognition of Baidu AI Cloud.

To address fast-growing demand, we strategically upgraded our MaaS platform Qianfan to be agent-centric. Qianfan is now positioned to provide not only leading model services with a constantly enriched model library, but also cutting-edge agent development capabilities and best-in-class agent infrastructure. By integrating high-quality proprietary and third-party capabilities and tools, Qianfan enables seamless agent creation and empowers enterprises to accelerate AI native application development.

At the application level, we are driving productivity gains, both internally and externally. Internally, our developers widely leverage Comate, our AI coding assistant for developers. In September, AI contributed to over 50% of new code generation under developer oversight substantially improving our overall engineering and R&D productivity. Comate exemplifies our belief that AI should liberate humans from repetitive tasks and deliver immediate efficiency gains.

Externally, we are democratizing AI through Miaoda, our no-code platform. After continuous capability enhancements, we launched the Miaoda's International version named MeDo in November, bringing powerful no-code capabilities to global users. By removing barriers like specialized training, we aim to empower more people worldwide to innovate and create with AI.

On intelligent driving, Apollo Go provided 3.1 million fully driverless operational rides in Q3, up 212% year-over-year. As of November 2025, cumulative rides provided to the public have surpassed 17 million. In terms of geographic expansion, Apollo Go added 6 new cities, bringing its global footprint to 22 cities as of October 2025.

In Chinese Mainland, Apollo Go has already achieved 100% fully driverless operations in multiple cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Chengdu, Chongqing, Wuhan, Haikou, Sanya and more. These are not pilot zones, but represent real services already open to the public, which speaks to the maturity of our technology and operation.

On our asset-light model and domestic partnerships, we also made good progress this quarter. The asset-light approach allows us to expand our autonomous driving services through partnerships and facilitate faster and more capital-efficient expansion. Following the launch of fully autonomous vehicle rental services with CAR Inc, Apollo Go now enables cross-city travel in Hainan province with fully driverless rental vehicles, offering users a differentiated experience, not typically available through traditional car rental services, particularly for tourism and leisure travel.

In addition to our partnership with Hello Ride, we achieved scaled fully driverless operations in 2 cities in China, further validating the feasibility of the asset-light model. Looking ahead, we will continue to expand rapidly while prioritizing safety, accelerating the adoption of autonomous ride-hailing services across broader markets.

In our mobile ecosystem, the AI transformation of Baidu Search continued to progress in Q3. At the end of October, roughly 70% of mobile search result pages contain AI-generated content. We believe this represents an optimal and sustainable level. This quarter, we prioritized enhancing the quality of multimodal content within AI search results while expanding our overall content ecosystem.

AI generated multimodal content saw rapid growth in both volume and quality. In particular, with daily AIGC video generation consistently at the scale of millions, our total AIGC video content continues to expand quickly while daily distribution within Baidu App is also seeing strong growth. As content supply improves, users experience richer, more relevant and engaging search results, user metrics continue to improve. In September, Baidu App MAU reached 708 million, up 1% year-over-year. The daily average time spent per user in Q3 increased 2.3% year-over-year. We are also extending our AI search capabilities to external partners through the Baidu AI search API, which enables integration of our industry-leading search technology that delivers superior accuracy, authority and comprehensiveness.

Leading companies such as Samsung, Xiaomi and Honor have already adopted the API. This strategic initiative expands our technology's reach beyond our own ecosystem, unlocking new business models and creating broader value across the industry.

Underpinned by our full stack AI capabilities, each business group within Baidu has seen rapid progress with AI driving both product innovation and business growth. From an AI-native perspective, our portfolio cuts across business groups with a comprehensive range of AI-powered businesses from AI Cloud Infra to AI Applications, such as Baidu Wenku and Baidu Drive and to AI native marketing services, including agents and digital humans, all of which are showing strong growth momentum.

In the physical world, Apollo Go, our largest AI application continues to scale rapidly, and these are just a few examples, underscoring the broad-based growth of our AI-powered businesses and the meaningful business impact our AI capabilities are already delivering at scale.

Looking ahead, we will continue to expand our AI-powered revenue streams and strengthen our position to capture the long-term opportunities ahead. We are confident that our AI capabilities will bring even greater transformative value across our portfolio in the years to come.

With that, let me turn the call over to Henry to go through the financial results.

Haijian He
Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Robin, and hello, everyone. Robin just mentioned our AI-powered businesses, and I'd like to elaborate. Based on ongoing feedback from investors and to better reflect valuation drivers based on our current portfolio, we are introducing a new AI native view this quarter cut across business groups to track AI-empowered assets company-wide.

This new view organized our business according to the nature of our products and services, helping investors better understand the fundamental valuation drivers across our diverse product and service offerings.

Going forward, we will provide business updates through this AI native view on an ongoing basis, while continuing to disclose results under the existing reporting methods, giving investors complementary lenses to assess the value of our portfolio. From this AI native view, we have a rich array of AI in power assets.

We are highlighting 3 categories this quarter. AI Cloud Infra, AI applications and AI native marketing services. First, AI Cloud Infra, which refers to the AI infrastructure and platform services we provide to enterprises and public sector. In Q3, revenue from AI Cloud Infra reached RMB 4.2 billion, up 33% year-over-year. We operate one of China's most advanced AI accelerator infrastructure, enabling highly efficient and cost-effective training and inference across diverse enterprise workloads. Within AI Cloud Infra, subscription-based AI accelerator infrastructure revenue grew 128% year-over-year.

Second, AI Applications. These are AI-native or AI-powered product offerings addressing specific use cases for individuals and enterprises, including our flagship software products such as Baidu Wenku, Baidu Drive and digital employee. AI is transforming how applications create value, enabling far more powerful capabilities that address real-world scenarios more effectively. We built a leading and comprehensive portfolio across both individuals and enterprises.

Most of our AI applications are based on sticky subscription models, delivering high-quality revenue. In Q3, AI Applications generated revenue of RMB 2.6 billion. Third, our AI native marketing services, such as agents and digital humans continue to scale rapidly. This represents our second growth curve beyond our legacy business.

These innovative products are gaining strong traction with customers seeking performance-driven AI-native solutions. Customers are increasingly willing to pay a premium for cutting-edge AI technology that delivers measurable improvements in productivity, marketing efficiency and ROI.

In Q3, revenue from AI-native marketing services reached RMB 2.8 billion, representing a robust 262% year-over-year increase, accounting for 18% of Baidu Core's online marketing revenue. Now let me walk through the details of our third quarter financial results.
