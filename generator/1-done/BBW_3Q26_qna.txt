Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Eric Beder with SCC Research.

Eric Beder
Small Cap Consumer Research, LLC

I'd like to button up on the tariff piece a little bit. So you [Technical Difficulty] tariffs is about $10 million and a little bit of that was in Q2. When we think about next year, what are the opportunities to reduce this? Because if I sit here and just kind of extrapolate it to kind of like about $18 million in tariff impact next year. How should we be thinking about this going forward and your ability to start mitigating this even further?

Vojin Todorovic
Chief Financial Officer

I'll take that, Eric. Thank you for your question. As we mentioned in our call, yes, this year, we had about 7 months of tariff expenses. We believe that's going to be less than $11 million total for 7 months. As we go into next year, even though we are not providing any guidance on 2026 at this point, there is going to be additional months. Clearly, first 5 months of next year, we'll have some tougher comparison because we are going to be experiencing tariffs.

We continue to work to find ways to mitigate some of the challenges that are caused by tariffs. Even as you've seen in our quarter, this year in Q4, we had $4 million of negative tariff impact and our profits only declined at a smaller margin. So we continue to do things that are within our control. We are working with our partners in Asia to reduce our cost. We are looking at ways to selectively and increase prices where we can to mitigate the offset of this additional cost. We are managing things within our control, such as promotions and discounts. And that's part of the reason, even in Q3, we are seeing a lesser negative impact of these tariffs on our financials with our strong margin results.

So there are things that we continue to do to manage from the margin perspective as well as we are looking at things from the overall P&L perspective that are within our control to help mitigate some of those things that we are seeing.

Now one of the positive things from the tariff perspective as administration like the Chinese rates will go from 30% to 20% next year. So that will be a little bit of a benefit compared to the 30% that we had for a big part of this year.

Sharon John
President, CEO & Director

It's also important to realize that some of our strategic initiatives that we have implemented even prior to the tariff situation have been focused on the diversification of the company. And so as Chris noted in some of his comments, we are growing our store count outside the United States, which are not for the large part, impacted by the tariff situation.

Eric Beder
Small Cap Consumer Research, LLC

Great. And I want to talk about something we can see in our store visits. So one of the things in 2025 has been kind of the, I guess, diversification in pricing in the sense that the Mini Beans continue to be a great part of the business and they're about $10 right now. And on the flip side, we've also seen some higher-priced items expand such as the Giant Furry Friends. And to your point about Glisten, Glisten is a limited edition. It's about -- correct me, it's $100. How -- where are you seeing kind of the gains from doing these pieces? And how is this diversification? Is it bringing in the different customers to the business? And where should we be thinking about that going forward?

Sharon John
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Eric, I'll start. Yes. I mean we've talked about diversification across numerous fronts over the years and rethinking beyond just what had been the standard approach to Build-A-Bear Workshop because the brand equity is, in our opinion, and from a research perspective is bigger than just the location of Build-A-Bear Workshop. That's one thing.

But the second piece of the diversification is not just the global aspect that I mentioned, but yes, we have an enormous amount of opportunity, we believe, from the multigenerational aspect, which I noted in my comments, 40% of our sales are to teens and adults. That often, particularly when it is related to license, some of our key licensed products allows us a lot more pricing latitude. And then we have also had partnerships in the past where we've been up in the $100 range before like the Swarovski relationship that we have.

But that latitude, both on the lower end and the higher end, does bring in different types of gifts. And we reiterated that in that we believe that we have an opportunity to appeal to more people in more places for more products and more occasions.

So while we have Mini Beans at $10, which are meant to be and, in fact, are manifesting themselves as a collectible, so people tend to buy more than one of those, so in an individual is a $10 purchase, but you usually are buying more than one. But we also continue to offer at the lowest end, our birthday treat bear. So we have accessibility to consumers. But it is our -- we believe that it's an important aspect of our brand to stretch the limits on what makes sense and what that is still valuable to the consumer. People love Glisten. So we wanted to try our own collectibles this year in our own special limited edition, and thus far so good.

Our next question is from Greg Gibas with Northland Securities.

Gregory Gibas
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

Great. Wondering if you could speak to your promotional activity in the quarter? Was it something that you leaned into a little bit more? Or I guess, maybe how would you say compared year-over-year?

Vojin Todorovic
Chief Financial Officer

Well, actually, our promotional activity, we have been managing our discounts and promotional activity much more stringently. And we are actually seeing lower discount rate in the quarter as we have seen over the last couple of quarters. This is one of those things that we believe it's within our control, and this is one of the ways we are trying to help mitigate the impact of some of these additional costs that are outside of our control. And as a reminder, over many years that we've been with the company, we have done a tremendous job of expanding our merchandise margin, managing our margin cost and being really focused on the experience and driving the overall ticket value versus really trying to drive growth to promotion.

Our brand, it's very unique in a way how we are positioned and people are coming to our stores to celebrate their special events. And we believe creating the best experience for them and upselling and doing things to really enhance that experience is the way for us to both grow the business and deliver strong margin results. This goes in line as being a destination and people are coming to celebrate these special events and over the years, we have done, in my opinion, doing a really good job managing the margin and expanding over probably 1,000 points over the last decade or so.

Gregory Gibas
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

Got it. That's very helpful. And I wanted to ask if you could share anything more about trends that you're seeing with Mini Bean sales and then, I guess, just overall demand with that product line? And I guess progress with kind of new SKU introductions with that product line as well.

Sharon John
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Well, we're really excited about Mini Beans for a number of reasons. And I did share in the comments that we were approaching $3 million in sales. And just in this last quarter, we saw a 60% increase. And we are now, and as I mentioned as well, in the early stages, but we're selling Mini Beans in different retailers outside of the workshop, but also to a lot of our partners where we have partner-operated relationships. So it's got the mask head of the Build-A-Bear, but it's like Great Wolf Lodge, for example, they offer so many also outside of the United States and some of our partnerships in Europe.

But we see this as it's a -- we create variety with the Mini Beans. They are collectible. They are seasonal. We bring out new characters. Some of them are based on our favorites from the Build-A-Bear historical collection. We also bring out what we call takedown of some of the seasonal products that we're doing and people like to buy those together. But we're also just recently created things with partners. So we're starting to have Mini Beans with some of our licenses which has been extremely successful and very exciting.

So Sanrio, as an example, which we mentioned a number of times in the prepared remarks, with Hello Kitty and Friends, just again, a tremendous multidimensional partnership for us, whether that's us creating seasonal products with them or Mini Beans with them or even new locations with that partnership. It's been wonderful and they have such great fans and the fan base overlaps tremendously with Build-A-Bear. So it makes a lot of sense.

But we see Mini Beans as just -- it's a proof point in many ways of how we can extend beyond the make your own plush. And while we will never remove the destination aspect from the centerpiece and the heart of our company, it's how people are often introduced to our brand, and it's where that halo effect comes from. It is important for us to recognize that there is potential beyond that.

Gregory Gibas
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

Yes, that's good to hear. Congrats on the Black Friday.

Sharon John
President, CEO & Director

Thank you.

Our next question is from Steve Silver with Argus Research.

Steven Silver
Argus Research Company

I had a question about the tie-ins. I know you guys mentioned that you had a presence around the Wicked movie coming out, which came out like right around Thanksgiving, which may have contributed to the strong results on Black Friday. But I'm just trying to get a sense as to just broadly speaking, whenever Build-A-Bear is involved with a high-profile movie launch and a tie-in kind of thing, whether the sales that those products generate are really more concentrated around the launch of those movies or really what the tail looks like for how long beyond the launch marketing tends to go toward these products and how long the contributions extend?

Sharon John
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thank you. Yes. So this is actually our second year of Wicked. We had Wicked with the original movie and because we knew, as did many of the partners that, that would be a 2-year event, successive years. So it's been great because Wicked was more successful than we expected in the first year so we were able to prepare a little bit better for this year. And while it is the tremendous partnership, I really can't look at it and say that's the reason why we drove Black Friday or that's the reason why we're seeing this increase. Our November trend is based on a much broader assortment than that.

But of course, all of these licenses and everything that we do to appeal to different consumer groups for different purposes, and even our growth outside the United States is helpful in the achievement of those objectives and Black Friday. In fact, one of the interesting things about Black Friday is, I believe, Eric mentioned earlier, is these jumbos. We had a really great -- we did do a promotion. We just walked through like last week, but we don't. But I mean, clearly, you have to participate in what the consumer expects on the Black Friday. But very limited promotion on that on the -- in some ways to introduce people to the aspect of these jumbos, and that was a big success for us on Black Friday.

But the tail to your question of licensed products, particularly related to film. I'm going to apologize upfront. It's such a wide variety. They're almost like snowflakes. I mean it is a -- there isn't that much of a predictability on exactly how the consumer will react. Now we have a lot more information when it's a sequel like we did with Wicked because -- and that's a known entity. So that one we expect we had a little more latitude and those are a little more stretchy. But literally, unless the film is a big hit, if it's an unknown, it's -- you try to calculate and manage your risk on that. We do a pretty good job.

Steven Silver
Argus Research Company

Okay. I appreciate the color. And one more, if I may. It was a very interesting concept, the idea of expanding to a second Build-A-Bear location in these initial malls. I think you mentioned American Dream and Mall of America. So given the fact that Build-A-Bear would then have a multiple presence in some of these large malls, I'm curious as to whether that plays into any leverage from Build-A-Bear just in terms of lease terms given the existing presence and the contribution that Build-A-Bear is already making to some of these locations?

Sharon John
President, CEO & Director

Yes, that's a great question. I mean, obviously, the more revenue you're driving and the more foot traffic you participate or create with any of our great mall partners, it does create another bullet point of communication and possible leverage, if you want to call it that.

But our biggest, I would say, opportunity there is just continuing to work with these partners, particularly given that 60%, 70%, up to 80%, depending on how you think about it or some of our research, of our guests are coming to Build-A-Bear that happens to be in the mall or just coming to the mall and like stumbling into a Build-A-Bear. That destination-driven marketing and the experience that we provide is now the hallmark of what most retailers are looking for. We are often credited with being a pioneer in that space. And that's a big asset for us as an organization, as a company, and we realize that and so do our partners.

So that's probably our largest contribution in many of the discussions that we have with malls is that we believe we're part of the solution of people returning to in-person shopping and mall shopping and as do our partners, which is why we are getting a second location in 2 of the biggest destination-based retail concepts in the United States.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Keegan Cox with D.A. Davidson.

Keegan Tierney Cox
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Yes. I was just curious on what you guys said with respect to the slowdown you saw with the government shutdown. I'm just wondering, did you see a trade down from your customer, like a mix shift towards lower price point products like Mini Beans? And then kind of continuing on that theme, how that spend shapes on kids versus kind of your adult customer?

Vojin Todorovic
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So thanks, Keegan, for the question. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, definitely, we saw some strength in our business in the first 2 months of the quarter. Then October, we had a little bit of a slowdown in traffic. And there are a few things that were happening at that time. Definitely, there was some noise related by the government shutdown. In addition to that, last year, we had an introduction of -- for us at that time, we licensed Bluey, that performed really well for us and did help drive traffic last year. So that compounded some of the traffic challenges that we were facing this time around.

And as we talked about, we had softer finish to the Q3, but we rebounded in November, and we are seeing some positive momentum. We, as Sharon talked about, best Black Friday in our history. So some of those things, it is really difficult to point out specifically what's happening. But we are seeing growth in Mini Beans, as Sharon told, over 3 million units sold -- or sorry, approaching 3 million units sold with that particular property. But in addition to that, we are selling these giants to our consumer like over $100 price point. So we are getting like to a lot of different consumers.

And I don't think that's necessarily impacting us in a negative way. Our dollar per transactions continue to grow and we are pleased with that. Our conversion is strong. So those are things that we believe are within our control. But definitely, there are concerns and challenges when we think from the macro environment and things that we always say, things that are outside of our control. We are trying to mitigate. We are trying to manage our expenses. And we still feel good about the guidance that we have provided on the full year basis to deliver fifth consecutive record year in our history.

Keegan Tierney Cox
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Got it. And then listening to just some of your competitor calls and some Black Friday store checks, they mentioned they're taking share in plush, and I saw that in some stores. I know you guys mostly benchmark against yourself. But as we think about the Mini Beans opportunity, I mean, what interests you about fulfilling that product in other retailers and taking on that competition.

Vojin Todorovic
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So definitely, that's one of those areas that when we think about what's happening with our stores, what's happening with Mini Beans, as I mentioned that we are approaching 3 million units sold in our stores. And that portion of those sales are also in other retail channels. So we are selling some of that to wholesale account, that's definitely an area of opportunity for us. And we believe there is a little white space as we move forward.

But as we think about the overall plush sales and everything, I can't comment on how other people and what their performance is, but I'll again reiterate, it's a fifth consecutive year of record results for us. So year after year, yes, we continue to beat our revenue goals, margin goals, so we are pleased with the progress that we are making. But there is still some white space for us as we look to the future, especially in the wholesale channel.

Sharon John
President, CEO & Director

And I'll just add a little bit to that. I mean, while we're really pleased with our growth from experiential retail location expansion, and I think Chris mentioned to 651 locations around the globe now, the expansion into new retail environments, that offers up literally thousands of doors that Build-A-Bear would otherwise not have a presence in, where it's not necessary to go through the experience that created us, but because that experience is so emotional and sell memorable, it creates a halo effect. It's that brand and the brand equity stretches beyond the workshop walls. And Mini Beans is an example of that in that they are -- people understand that this is going to be a quality product. They think of it as it has the branded equity with it. So it's not just another plush on the shelf, it's Build-A-Bear.

So when you think about what is the essence of the competition, we believe that the Mini Beans carry that branded aspect that benefits it in that space. And we are seeing that from early sales, both, of course, inside the Build-A-Bear Workshop, as I noted, but in some of the early stages of outside of the workshops as well.
