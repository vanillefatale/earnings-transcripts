And your first question will be from Guilherme Mendes at JPMorgan.

Guilherme Mendes
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

My first question is on the rebalance in Argentina. Martin, you mentioned that discussions are progressing well. But can you share what are the main milestones that we could expect for the near term and the potential timing -- and the timing for the potential approval?

And a follow-up on the commercial revenues. First of all, congrats on the strong performance. And what can we expect going forward? So is this a more normalized level? Or can we still expect some kind of improvement on the commercial revenues per PAX?

Jorge Arruda
Chief Financial Officer

This is Jorge. Thanks for your question. So in connection with Argentina, we continue to make progress both on a technical and political level. It's difficult for us in management to provide a timetable. But the message again is that we continue to make good progress in connection with the rebalance of the concession agreement.

In connection with your second question, commercial revenues. Commercial revenues in the quarter was up 8% versus last year. It's a very good performance. And as we reported, there are a number of reasons, including VIP lounges, car rental, fueling, cargo, et cetera. We continue to see the same trend. I'm not sure that it is accelerating, but definitely, we continue to see the trend to continue.

Next question will be from Andres Cardona at Citigroup.

Andres Cardona
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

My question is about any update you could share with us about the Armenia and vis-a-vis investment opportunities, if you have any update or visibility of the time line to provide more details on the projects.

Jorge Arruda
Chief Financial Officer

Andres, it's Jorge again here, and thanks for your questions. So let me start with the second one. In Italy, as Martin has mentioned, we have recently obtained the approval for the environmental assessment of the project. The next step formally is the so-called confidential [indiscernible] issue to take place, which is a kind of forum of various government entities led by the Ministry of Infrastructure. We expect that to commence towards the end of the first quarter, and it's a process that should take approximately 3 months, after which then we would basically be ready to start the works. So that's the current time line that we have been told.

Again, when we are dealing with the government, it's difficult for us to -- in management to set up a precise timetable, but that's our best guess as of today, and we will continue to keep the market updated. In connection with Armenia, we continue to make good progress in terms of discussions and in connection with discussions with the government and government officials in general. And again, it's difficult for us to provide a precise timetable. But again, we will keep the market posted.

And next question will be from Daniel Rojas at Bank of America.

Daniel Vielman
BofA Securities, Research Division

My question was regarding the Baghdad Airport. Could you give us an idea of the size of the opportunity? And what else can you share with us in terms of potential traffic in that airport?

Jorge Arruda
Chief Financial Officer

Daniel, it's Jorge again. Thank you very much. As we have announced, we signed an Award Agreement, which is a document that is nonbinding from -- in connection with the process. We are expecting to be called by the government to finalize the process and sign the concession agreement. Once that happens, we will inform the market and provide more details about our financial plan in many aspects, including debt, equity, CapEx, et cetera. But what I wanted to anticipate is that we have a very constructive view in connection with the potential growth of traffic in that country and in that region in general.
