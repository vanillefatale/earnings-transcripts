Eddie Wu: Welcome to Alibaba Group's quarterly earnings call. Over the past quarter, Alibaba
delivered steady and healthy growth. Our total revenue increased 15% year-over year,
excluding Sun Art and InTime. Our continued investment in core businesses is yielding results,
with China e-commerce CMR growing 10% and cloud intelligence revenue rising 34%. Let me
walk you through the latest developments across our AI+ cloud and consumption businesses.
Sustained strong demand for AI and rising usage of public cloud drove Alibaba Cloud's 34%
revenue growth this quarter, while revenue from external customers accelerated by 29%.
AI-related products continued to post triple-digit year-over-year growth for the ninth
consecutive quarter. In the cloud computing market, two major trends are becoming
increasingly apparent. First, as AI applications scale, more developers and enterprise
customers are choosing vendors with full-stack AI technology portfolios.
Eddie Wu: Second, customers are deepening and broadening their use of AI, which is
significantly increasing demand for compute, storage, and other traditional cloud services.
Together, these forces are accelerating revenue growth driven by external customer demand.
This quarter, we continued to strengthen our full-stack AI capabilities, spanning
high-performance AI infrastructure, foundation models, and AI development frameworks. Our
flagship model, QN3 Max, ranks among the global leaders in benchmarks for real-world coding
tasks, agent tool use capabilities, and other specialized evaluations. Our full-stack AI
capabilities are now a defining competitive advantage. Alibaba Cloud is gaining market share
across multiple segments. In the hybrid cloud market, Alibaba Cloud has become a key player,
growing more than 20% year-over-year, outpacing the industry and steadily expanding market
share. Our financial cloud business is also growing faster than the market, with market share
continuing to rise.
Eddie Wu: In China's AI cloud market, we're also the clear leader, with a market share larger
than the combined total of the second to fourth largest providers. Recently, businesses such as
the NBA, Marriott, China UnionPay, and Bosch have partnered with Alibaba Cloud on AI
initiatives. Last week, we officially launched the QN app, which aims to be the most advanced
personal AI assistant powered by our latest models. In the first week of its public beta, the QN
app has already surpassed 10 million in new downloads. The launch of the QN app marks
Alibaba's commitment to both AI for enterprise and AI for consumer. In enterprise-focused AI,
our goal is to build a world-leading full-stack AI provider serving businesses across all
industries. For consumers, we aim to build native AI-first applications by leveraging our
best-in-class models and Alibaba's extensive ecosystem.
Eddie Wu: On the one hand, QN3 Max's intelligence and world-class tool use capabilities,
combined with Alibaba's rich consumer and lifestyle use cases, contributed to exceptional user
retention in the QN app's beta release. We believe this is the right moment to scale our
consumer AI efforts. On the other hand, the synergy between AI and the broader Alibaba
ecosystem is a powerful multiplier. Alibaba is the only company in China with both a leading
large model and extensive lifestyle and commerce use cases. QN will gradually integrate
e-commerce, map navigation, local services, and more, becoming an AI-powered entry point for
everyday life. With AI innovation and ecosystem collaboration reinforcing each other, we're
confident in our ability to deliver substantial user value. In consumption, we continue to
deepen collaboration across businesses, and the benefits of our large integrated platform are
becoming increasingly evident. This quarter, China e-commerce CMR grew 10%.
Eddie Wu: Our quick commerce business saw significant improvement in unit economics, with
greater fulfillment efficiency, stronger user retention, higher average order value, and
expanding scale. The growth of quick commerce business contributed to rapid growth in
Taobao App's monthly active consumers and supported CMR expansion. Brands on Tmall are
also accelerating their adoption of on-demand retail. As of October 31, approximately 3,500
brands on Tmall have onboarded their offline stores to our quick commerce business. Going
forward, we will further enhance synergy between quick commerce and the broader Alibaba
ecosystem, continue improving unit economics, and meet consumers' fast-growing demand for
immediate access to diverse products and services. On October 1, AMAP's daily active users
reached a historical high of 360 million. In September, we launched the AMAP Street Stars
feature, which has significantly boosted user engagement.
Eddie Wu: In October, AMAP Street Stars averaged more than 70 million daily active users, with
average daily user reviews more than triple the amount of the same period last year, indicating
strong future growth potential. AMAP Street Stars has built a trust-based rating system for
local offline services using user-consented metrics, such as the user's credit rating. We believe
that enhancing consumer trust is essential to strengthening consumer confidence, enabling
merchants to focus on operations while giving consumers greater peace of mind, supporting
the healthy and sustainable growth of the local offline services sector. Looking ahead, we'll
continue investing decisively in our two core strategic pillars: AI+ cloud and consumption. We
will advance both enterprise and consumer-focused AI, unlock deeper synergies across
Alibaba's businesses, and use these engines to drive Alibaba's long-term growth and carry the
company to the next level. Thank you. I will now hand over to Toby.
Toby Xu: Thank you, Eddie. We are continuing our focus and discipline on AI+ cloud and
consumption, and we see strong momentum from these strategies with gains in technology,
market share, consumers, and user engagement. Now, let's look at the financial results. On a
consolidated basis, total revenue was RMB 247.8 billion. Excluding revenue from Sun Art and
InTime, revenue on a like-for-like basis would have grown by 15% year over year. Total
Adjusted EBITDA decreased to 78%, primarily due to our strategic investments in quick
commerce business to grow its user base and transaction volume, partly offset by double-digit
revenue growth in China e-commerce group and cloud intelligence group, and improved
operating efficiencies across various businesses, including AIDC and Hujing DME. Our GAAP
net income was RMB 20.6 billion, a decrease of 53%, primarily attributable to the decrease in
income from operations.
Toby Xu: Operating cash flow was RMB 10.1 billion, a decrease of RMB 21.3 billion compared to
the same quarter last year. The year-over-year decrease was mainly attributed to our increased
strategic investments in quick commerce business. Free cash flow was an outflow of RMB 21.8
billion, which reflected our significant investments in quick commerce business and AI+ cloud
infrastructure. We are reinvesting our free cash flow to create a winning quick commerce
business and to be a leader in AI. Our strong balance sheet, backed by $41 billion in net cash,
gives us confidence for this reinvestment strategy. Revenue from Alibaba China e-commerce
group was RMB 132.6 billion, an increase of 16%. Customer management revenue increased by
10%, primarily due to the improvement of take rate, which benefited from the increasing
penetration of Chen Zhan Tui and the addition of software service fees.
Toby Xu: Revenue from our quick commerce business increased 60%. During the quarter, we
executed our plan to grow the scale of our quick commerce business, improve user experience,
and narrow UE loss. The Adjusted EBITDA from Alibaba China e-commerce group was RMB
10.5 billion. Excluding loss from our quick commerce business, our Alibaba China e-commerce
group EBITDA would have grown at mid-single-digit year-over-year for the quarter. Going
forward, this adjusted EBITDA may fluctuate quarter over quarter due to intense competition
and a significant investment in user experience. Revenue from AIDC grew 10%. AliExpress, in
particular, has developed its AliExpress Direct model that leverages local inventories in over 30
countries. AliExpress has also enhanced the range of our product offerings by launching the
Brand Plus program, providing go-to-market solutions to Chinese brands going overseas.
Toby Xu: A combination of logistics optimization and investment efficiency enhancement
resulted in AIDC's Adjusted EBITDA profit of RMB 162 million this quarter. Looking ahead,
while we continue to enhance operating efficiency, AIDC Adjusted EBITDA may fluctuate
quarter-over-quarter due to tactical investments in select markets. Our cloud business
delivered another quarter of accelerated growth, as both growth of cloud segment revenue and
revenue from external customers accelerated to 34% and 29%, respectively. This momentum
was primarily driven by public cloud revenue growth, including the increasing adoption of
AI-related products. AI-related product revenue continued to grow at triple-digit pace. AI-related
product revenue this quarter accounted for over 20% of revenue from external customers, with
its contribution continuing to increase. We are seeing accelerated adoption of our AI products
across a broader range of enterprise customers, with a growing focus on value-added
applications, including coding assistants.
Toby Xu: The Adjusted EBITDA margin remained relatively stable at 9%. We will continue to
invest in customer growth and technology innovation to increase adoption of AI infrastructure
cloud and strengthen our market leadership. All other segment revenue was a decrease by
25%, mainly due to the disposal of Sun Art and Intime businesses. All others Adjusted EBITDA
was a loss of RMB 3.4 billion, primarily due to the increased investment in technology
businesses, partly offset by the improving operating results of other businesses. Hujing DME
has achieved profitability for three consecutive quarters. The all other segment comprises a set
of innovative initiatives, including several strategic AI-driven technology infrastructure and
businesses, including our foundation model and AI apps. We are excited to continue investing
in these initiatives for future growth. Thank you. That's the end of our prepared remarks. We
can open up for Q&A.
