[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.

Dara Mohsenian
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So Oran, on the base business, can you just help us unpack the 40% year-to-date growth you mentioned in international markets? Obviously, that's been a greater focus for you guys year-to-date. What have been the key geographic drivers of growth there from a country standpoint? And then just as you look out to 2026, you mentioned further scaling the international business. Is that around further country penetration? Is it SpoiledChild expansion? Just the key expansion or white space opportunities as you look going forward?

Oran Holtzman
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Sure. So the first 9 months, just to put things in perspective, still 83% of revenue came from the U.S. So although international grew 40%, it is still tiny comparing to the U.S. while for others, as you know, international is approximately 2/3 of their business. For us, it's still 17%. Our plan is to continue to responsibly grow across the board in international markets. But as we said in our remarks, it's a huge revenue and profit opportunity for us, and we see that it's strategically important for us.

We scale international when we think it makes sense. We don't run and spend in user acquisition just because we want to grow international or because we see softness in the U.S. The opposite. Where we see opportunity, this is where we push and we get more revenue. This year, we grew 40%, but like the objective is not just to grow the international market. And in terms of countries today, existing countries, Canada, U.K., Germany, Australia, Israel and France. New geographies are Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Ireland and Sweden and Denmark. Markets that we are adding as testing are Japan, Mexico, Korea, Belgium and a few others. But this year, only 2% of revenue came from new countries and the 15% came from existing countries. So basically, the majority of the growth came from countries that we already were active in.

Dara Mohsenian
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

That's very helpful. And then just one on METHODIQ. Just high level, any thoughts after you've done some testing there on how much ability the platform has to bring in new customers to the ODDITY franchise and perhaps over time, indirectly drive beauty sales and cross-sell? And just as you see initial interest in the platform, how much of that is coming from your existing consumer base versus a new consumer base?

Oran Holtzman
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Every new country is completely new because we don't have users there. So that's why it's -- in terms of cost, it costs more because like we don't have any existing users.

Lindsay Mann
Global Chief Financial Officer

Oran, his question is on METHODIQ. The question is on METHODIQ, right there.

Oran Holtzman
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Sorry, I couldn't hear you. Yes, sorry. In terms of METHODIQ, yes, of course, like SpoiledChild, when we started, the majority of revenue came from IL MAKIAGE, and we expect that a decent percentage will come from IL MAKIAGE and SpoiledChild for METHODIQ. Of course, we are also doing user acquisition because we want to expand our user base. So it will be mixed. Over time, of course, when the brand grows, then we will have more acquisition, but we are doing both.

Our next question is from Anna Lizzul with Bank of America.

Anna Lizzul
BofA Securities, Research Division

On METHODIQ, just wondering in terms of how we should be thinking about this brand for '26. Just wondering if you can continue to elaborate on how you're thinking about new customer acquisition for METHODIQ. Just how can we think about it incrementally versus SpoiledChild and IL MAKIAGE? And just in terms of the investments that you're making, we previously expected, I guess, a larger headwind on the second half in SG&A and the guidance for Q4 implies that this might not be as bad as we previously expected. So was wondering if you can comment on this also for the beginning of '26 in the context of the new brand launch.

Oran Holtzman
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

I will start with high level. Our expectation from METHODIQ Brand 3 is to scale faster than SpoiledChild, which was one of the best D2C launches of all time. And our expectation here is to see even bigger numbers. In terms of contribution due to the fact that it's like relatively small, like SpoiledChild did $25 million in year 1. And even if we do a bit more, still comparing to our next year revenue goal is still tiny.

So Lindsay, if you want to touch regarding contribution for both top line and bottom line and METHODIQ.

Lindsay Mann
Global Chief Financial Officer

Yes. No, that's right. We haven't given -- we're not ready to give any specific plans for 2026 for METHODIQ. But of course, as we look long term, we're extremely bullish about the brand. This is a telehealth platform that is really reimagined what medical care would look like if it was built entirely around the customer. Oran talked about the world-class treatments we've put together, highest standards of care, truly personalized to the individual and broadly available to everyone available online.

We're starting in dermatology. That's a focus for us right now, a market that we understand really well because we've got around half of our IL MAKIAGE and SpoiledChild users on the ODDITY platform that tell us they have issues like acne and dark spots and eczema. And so it's a nice place for us to begin, as we said with the earlier question. And there's truly nothing like it on the market. So we're very, very bullish, but we are in very early stages. We had our soft launch on time in the third quarter. We just launched formally this week. A lot of very strong early signals, but still lots of work for us to do before we figure out our plans in terms of timing of scaling, et cetera, but we're really excited.

As far as the SG&A implied guidance for Q4 versus prior, I guess what I would say is, historically, we like to guide to revenue and EBITDA. And then from a gross margin perspective, we always give the team a lot of flexibility. So we try to guide conservatively that allow them to kind of chase whatever products from a DC margin perspective, that's gross margin after media spend. That's how we evaluate the business. We want them to have lots of flexibility to go after the right DC margin or other products that from a strategy perspective, we're focused on. So gross margin is not an internal focus metric.

And as a result for our guidance, we try to walk you guys to a place where we feel really comfortable we can deliver, and we've historically delivered a bit better, but we're always managing towards that revenue and EBITDA figure. So I wouldn't read too much into that. We still have some nice investment planned for all of our growth initiatives, including METHODIQ in the fourth quarter, and we talked about the growth investments in the first half of 2026 on our prior call.

Our next question is from Youssef Squali with Truist Securities.

Youssef Squali
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

I have 2, maybe just starting with one, Oran. We've seen a pretty mixed bag of earnings from various consumer-oriented companies this earnings season. I think you alluded to that a little bit in your prepared remarks. Can you maybe speak to your views about the health of the U.S. consumer right now and some of the things that you guys are doing in particular, just to help ODDITY buck that trend? And I have another question.

Oran Holtzman
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Sure. Yes, like we see what you guys see regarding softness from like from the outside. But internally, as you can see based on our results, revenue is still like according to plan, even better. Margin was strong. This is despite the fact that we see like higher acquisition costs. And the main reason that we can offset it is just like the massive repeat that we have.

And when I try to think about the way like to think or to answer regarding softness, the first thing that I look at is obviously acquisition, but the second part is repeat. So yes, acquisition is higher, but repeat is getting way higher every quarter. And therefore, we are not impacted.

Youssef Squali
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Okay. That's great to hear. And then Lindsay, I know you're not guiding quite yet to 2026. But is the growth algo for 2026 any different from what we've expected or what we've heard from you guys up until this point, which is committing to basically 20% top line, about 20% adjusted EBITDA margins. And maybe within that, maybe just talk about the marketing efficiency in the business that you're seeing.

Lindsay Mann
Global Chief Financial Officer

Yes, we're not ready to give 2026 specific guidance. We'll give that when we issue our Q4 earnings results, but there's no change to our algorithm of 20% revenue growth and 20% adjusted EBITDA margin. And you heard Oran reiterate in his remarks earlier that the other sort of medium-term guidance that we've given for IL MAKIAGE to deliver $1 billion by 2028, there's no change to that either. So business continues to be on a very healthy footing.

As far as media efficiency goes, you heard Oran comment, we did have some higher acquisition costs. In my remarks, I mentioned the environment has actually improved for us as we've gotten into the fourth quarter. Overall, SG&A in the third quarter was up around 30%, and that's including some of the increased spending initiatives that we have, for example, for METHODIQ, ODDITY LABS, et cetera. So it's been very manageable for us, and we're feeling really good as we head into Q4.

Our next question is from Andrew Boone with Citizens.

Andrew Boone
Citizens JMP Securities, LLC, Research Division

Lindsay, as we think about METHODIQ being added to the model, is there anything that we should keep in mind in terms of the different financial profile, whether that be different AOVs, whether that be different margin profiles? Is there anything we should be considering as we think about the next 3 years and layering in that brand?

And then on ODDITY LABS, it's great to see molecules start to contribute to the portfolio in 2026. Can you guys just help us understand what the expectation is of proprietary molecules? It feels like a step function change in terms of what you guys can bring to market. How do we think about that? And then what's the path beyond those 8 initial products? How do we think beyond this first step?

Lindsay Mann
Global Chief Financial Officer

Oran, you want me to start?

Oran Holtzman
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes, please.

Lindsay Mann
Global Chief Financial Officer

So in terms of financial profile for METHODIQ, over the long term, we see this brand in a very similar framework that we think about with both IL MAKIAGE and SpoiledChild, and those are brands that will support long-term compounding 20% revenue growth and 20% adjusted EBITDA margin. So very healthy unit economics that we see for the category in general and that we think METHODIQ will deliver, especially as it relates to repeat and other KPIs that build into LTV.

I think for the prescription product, in particular, we will have lower gross margins, especially at first. We'll be -- we're always quite inefficient on the gross margin side when we launch a business. But in the case of prescription for METHODIQ, because you have the third-party physician network and also the compounding pharmacies, those are extra costs for us. The business we expect will be mostly not prescription, but you do have some of the prescription cost input that will impact on the gross margin side. However, we think you're going to have a really nice repeat business there that drives healthy DC margin. Probably too early to say much else, but we look forward to sharing a bit more as we progress post launch in 2026.

As it relates to ODDITY LABS, maybe I'll start and Oran, if you want to add additionally. As you guys know, in 2024, we made a strategic pivot with Labs where we decided to extend our development time lines in order to focus on delivering molecules that had much higher efficacy and far superior performance characteristics than what was on the market today. And so we knew that would delay some of the timing of certain launches, but we thought it was a really smart trade-off to make because we believe that we could produce things that were way better. And now you're starting to see the fruits of that labor.

So as we said, we expect in '26 that just for our existing brands, we'll have 8 products on the market, including 4 for METHODIQ. I would describe the METHODIQ brands products as some of them extremely innovative, addressing very important needs for the consumer. So we're really, really excited about that. And we have even additional -- we have a lot in the pipeline, including some molecules that we expect will be delivered with Brand 4 and more beyond. So I would just say super happy to see how the level of improvement that we got out of the work that we put into ODDITY LABS.

Oran Holtzman
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

I would just add that like when we started labs, we built it -- we started and we built it again. It was hard because the first time that we've done something like it. And the fact that you see so many products and so many molecules coming to market this year just shows like that what we've done was the right thing, and there is a real progress in labs. So we expect to see the same pace and even higher in the next few years. The fact that both METHODIQ and our IL MAKIAGE and SpoiledChild brands are going to get molecules this year is very encouraging. And again, just shows like the strength and the progress that we've done, which is significant in the past 1.5 years.

Our next question is from Cory Carpenter with JPMorgan.

Cory Carpenter
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I have 2, Lindsay, probably both for you. Just hoping you could expand on the comments around the media environment and higher acquisition costs now going a little lower. And anything in particular to call out on the search channel?

And then capital allocation, you have a healthy cash balance. You have not purchased shares since the convert earlier this year. So maybe if you could just refresh us on your capital allocation priorities.

Lindsay Mann
Global Chief Financial Officer

Sure. On the media side, media costs, as we've said before, they tend to get more expensive every year, but we are able to offset them really effectively with higher repeat and also other unlocks across our KPIs, including conversion and other things that we focus on. So this has allowed us to deliver a very healthy, sustained profitable business and repeat is running at around, call it, 2/3 of our overall business. And we were really -- are really pleased to see that the -- I discussed the net revenue repeat cohorts, like the 12-month cohorts and the cohorts that we examine are all continue to be really, really strong. So we think you're still seeing a healthy consumer environment and a solid environment for us to continue to deliver.

As far as our cash position goes, we're in a very strong position, almost $800 million of cash equivalents and investments on our balance sheet today. We post the convertible earlier this year, we view this as really efficient, patient capital for us that we have flexibility to do what we want with. So we, of course, have the opportunity to deploy it for buybacks. We have the opportunity to deploy it for M&A, and we feel like we're in a really strong position where we can be patient and selective about what we use it for.

Our next question is from Ryan MacDonald with Needham & Company.

Ryan MacDonald
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Congrats on a great quarter. As you look at the international success into the test market, can you talk about how replicable like the data model in terms of targeting subscribers and new users and then sort of identifying maybe more local or geographic differences in terms of what their needs product-wise might be just as you continue to scale that international efforts?

And then is your intent to immediately go international with METHODIQ right away? Or are you going to take sort of a more measured sort of region-by-region approach like you've done with other brands in the past?

Oran Holtzman
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Sure. So first of all, regarding METHODIQ, we thought only U.S. It's complex enough without international. So by the way, SpoiledChild was the same for the past -- for the first almost 3 years, we didn't even test international. So we plan to do the same with METHODIQ. I'm not sure it's going to be 3 years, but I don't think it's going to be way less than that.

Regarding international and what we -- exactly what you said, that's the reason why we do tests. And when I said test, like we open market with a localized website and starting to put -- to spend media against new users in those countries and to ship products based on that, we see satisfaction, we see repeat, we see unit economics, then we decide if this market is suitable for us or not. And that's how we -- that's what we have done for the past 2.5 years.

Our next question is from Scott Schoenhaus with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Scott Schoenhaus
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

METHODIQ here. Lindsay, you mentioned the majority of revenues were going to be -- volumes are coming from the nonprescription side versus prescription. Are the molecules, those 4 molecules also going to be for nonprescription versus prescription? And then as a follow-up, on the prescription side, the physician network that you've built, there's clearly a shortage of dermatologists. And so this is an asset. How are you thinking about deploying technology to leverage more dermatologists on your network for patients?

Lindsay Mann
Global Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Scott. So the 4 products are not prescription. They're a combination of OTC and cosmetic. And again, we're really excited to have them out there, but those are not prescription products. And in fact, for ODDITY LABS, we're not -- for the most part, and certainly, in the near to medium term, you won't see anything that's prescription coming from ODDITY LABS that will all be either OTC or cosmetic.

In terms of our physician network, we are currently plugged into third parties to help us with that. We have not brought that in-house, but we have the opportunity to do so for cost efficiency reasons down the road if we decide to do it. We -- the networks we're using now, we're using all physicians at the moment, not all dermatologists, but all board-certified physicians. And we can, of course, scale that to NPs and other medical care practitioners down the road. There's the opportunity for that, but we're starting with all physicians as we build that and learn.

And I think from a technology standpoint, it's really us building capabilities that allow the network of clinicians to get the strongest signals possible to help inform treatment decisions based on the inputs that we take, basically, when you're going through the METHODIQ intake and onboarding funnel, we're picking up on the contextual real pathways and real signals that -- the same thing that you would look for if you were in an office, right? So you're looking at questions about demographics, hormonality, history and that kind of stuff. Meanwhile, the vision tools are picking up signals like number of lesions, intensity and those kinds of signals that are really helpful for a clinician when making a decision about treatment outcomes.

So that's a really important part of our technology and then also just integrating our records directly with the provider systems that help the -- operate the clinician interface and help them to integrate with our tools. And then I think finally, like within the METHODIQ app, the ability to get feedback, progress tracking and to chat directly with your clinician to help drive things like confidence and most importantly, compliance and success, those are enormous ways we're using technology to drive the outcomes that we want.

Our next question is from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.

Bonnie Herzog
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I just have a question on IL MAKIAGE and SpoiledChild. Growth in the U.S. remains strong double digits for these brands, but it has moderated year-to-date versus last year. So could you talk about what's driving this? And if the low 20% growth in the U.S. for these 2 brands is doable over the next few years? Or should we expect a continued slowdown? I guess I'm asking especially for IL MAKIAGE. Also, could you touch on repeat rates for the brands and if these rates are also moderating?

Oran Holtzman
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

I will start by saying...

Lindsay Mann
Global Chief Financial Officer

Go ahead.

Oran Holtzman
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes, I would just start by saying that as I mentioned before, we manage growth across brands and geographies. So like I don't wake up tomorrow and say, today, I need to see 25% IL MAKIAGE in the U.S. We see we look more broader and we maximize the potential based on what we see in real time. So if Germany is working better at a specific day, this is where we push more and vice versa with SpoiledChild.

Lindsay, do you want to touch repeat?

Lindsay Mann
Global Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I mean just to add on that, like we are driving growth at the ODDITY level and our growth targets we're managing growth towards 20%. We don't want to grow faster than that. And so ever since our IPO, we have been very clear and explicit about our plans to sustain 20% compounded durable growth. And that's exactly what we've been delivering on, and we're managing it at the ODDITY level, and we'll pull different levers within the different brands.

Specific to IL MAKIAGE, our target is to get to $1 billion by 2028, and we've always talked about international being an important piece of that. And so you're seeing us flex on the international part now. At the same time, we want to make sure we're feeding SpoiledChild and now we have a third baby to give oxygen to. So we're managing it as a portfolio in order to deliver an overall ODDITY level growth. I think in terms of repeat, no, repeats continue to be very, very strong.

Our next question is from Georgia Anderson with Evercore ISI.

Georgia Anderson
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the TAM for METHODIQ. Are you guys kind of defining this as all chronic skin sufferers in the U.S. or globally? Or is it a narrow cohort, acne or eczema patients are willing to pay out of pocket? And then just kind of in terms of measuring success of the brand, do you have any milestones or KPIs that would give you confidence that METHODIQ is scaling towards its full TAM?

Oran Holtzman
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Lindsay, I'll start with the KPIs and you'll talk about TAM.

Lindsay Mann
Global Chief Financial Officer

Yes.

Oran Holtzman
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

So like we soft launched in September, official launch this week. So of course, very early. But based on what we see early, the demand is there. The KPIs that we look at now are user acquisition, repeat, up downloads, open rates, weekly check-ins. And like when we see that those KPIs as we envision they are, then we will start scaling.

Lindsay Mann
Global Chief Financial Officer

In terms of the TAM, the right way we think to look at this is number of people rather than dollar size. And the reason for that is because it's such a high friction market and one that hasn't been run well that we think if you actually can unleash some technology that leads to better outcomes and easier outcomes for people to access, you're going to see the overall market grow. And for these chronic skin conditions like acne and hyperpigmentation and eczema, I mean, your solutions are, number one, go to a dermatologist. Oran talked about 2/3 of U.S. counties don't even have a dermatologist. Your average wait times are over a month. People spend hours commuting to from plus sitting in the waiting room and waiting for a doctor's office. So it's a real pain in the neck, and it's not a great experience. So it's something people avoid.

And then your alternative of going to the drugstore, bouncing around with low efficacy products that don't really work, it's overall stifled the total potential size of the market. We think that by really opening up this much better user experience, highest standards of care, world-class treatments made available easily to everybody online, you're actually going to see the overall market size grow. And that's why we're unleashing we think it's like probably the biggest wave of innovation to dermatology in decades and maybe ever. So we're really excited about it.

And then if you look at just the number of the people, which is what we think is the right way to look at it in America, you've got 50 million Americans, around 50 million with acne, around 30 million with dark spots/hyperpigmentation, around 30 million with eczema. And just on our platform alone, we see the deep prevalence of these issues. A lot of people are buying foundation from IL MAKIAGE already to cover them up. So it's a natural place now that we have new tools and an effective way to address it for us to expand into.

Our next question is from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.

Lauren Lieberman
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I was just curious to talk a little bit about launch plans for METHODIQ and sort of learnings maybe from spoils because you did -- I recall that you did billboards for spoils. I see that you're doing it from METHODIQ. You talked about it being sort of the biggest -- I think you said biggest TikTok activation. So just curious about how you made decisions around the non-online portions of the launch and for how long you expect to have these kind of big TikTok activations going on because it's something right, you get lots of attention if days, but how should we think about that ongoing TikTok activation to get the brand's awareness up?

Oran Holtzman
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Sure. So it's the third brand that we are launching, and we've done the same more or less with all 3 offline activation out of the gate for IL MAKIAGE, SpoiledChild and now in New York, we have the same with METHODIQ. Regarding TikTok, it's the biggest campaign that we've done so far. And we started now, and we plan to continue until end of Q1.

Our next question is from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.

Brian Tanquilut
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. Maybe I'll follow up on Bonnie's question from earlier. As I think through the makeup of the growth rate for the quarter, very strong growth, obviously. How should we be thinking about volume versus pricing versus mix in that growth rate for the different product lines?

Lindsay Mann
Global Chief Financial Officer

The biggest driver of the vast majority of our revenue is driven just purely by orders. AOV was down around 1%, so essentially flat and order growth historically and in the future will be the dominant driver of our revenue growth.

Brian Tanquilut
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Understand. And if I may ask a follow-up, my follow-up question would just be, as we think about METHODIQ, is this going to be primarily a compounded drug product offering? Or is there a noncompounded version here? And how should we be thinking about like margin differentials between the 2, if that was the case?

Lindsay Mann
Global Chief Financial Officer

So the business today is a combination of nonprescription and prescription. Like we said, we think the prescription will be the smaller part of the business. And within the prescription, we're contemplating compounded products today with potential in the future, of course, to evolve, but that's the business model now.
