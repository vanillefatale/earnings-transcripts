Thank you, Mr. Hourican. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first today to Mark Carden of UBS.

Mark Carden
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So you put together the 140 basis point sequential local case growth improvement against a pretty tough restaurant backdrop industry-wide, sounds like a lot is coming together. Did you guys see much variation in local case growth on a monthly basis? And then is it safe to assume that January has accelerated even further given your momentum comment? And then finally, are you expecting to see much of a headwind related to the recent winter storms?

Kevin Hourican
CEO & Chairman

Mark, it's Kevin. Thanks for the question. I'll start with the factual component. The performance Sysco relative to the industry strengthened each month of Q2. So we got better relative to the industry for each of the months consecutively. We've seen that strength continue into January. I'll come back to January in just a moment.

As we step back and think about why, why is this performance happening? What are the drivers? Maybe I'll just go there for a few minutes. We have 3 new things, if you will, year-over-year. As I mentioned, the most important by far is SC retention, sales consultant retention, SC productivity up meaningfully year-over-year, both of those things, retention and productivity. We launched our AI360 selling tool approximately 90 days ago. We're getting traction from that tool. We launched Perks 2.0, which is a revamp of our loyalty program. We say internally be the best for our best customers. We're seeing increased customer retention and improved penetration rates with those existing customers.

Each of these 3 things that I just said, have nothing to do with foot traffic. They're 100% Sysco specific, and we're making tangible measurable progress. We can measure it by new rate customer wins versus loss rate of customer departures. The spread between that ratio widened in the quarter and then penetration, which is an incredibly important topic, which is sales to existing customers also is improving. And when you put that against a softening macro backdrop, it's clear silver evidence of the progress that we're making at Sysco.

Specific to Q3, the quarter we're now in. We had a strong January. January is out of the gate strong. To your point on weather this week, we saw favorability in weather in January versus prior year. We're going to give some of that back this week for obvious reasons given the huge wealth of the U.S. impacted. We don't talk about weather, if you will, on the forward. We'll find out at the end of the quarter if there was a positive or negative contribution from weather. But January is off to a strong start on the controllables that I just mentioned.

Kenny, anything you'd like to add?

Kenny Cheung
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. Thanks, Kevin. Mark, 3 things for me. Just to double-click on the kind of the phasing of the month. So if you look at between October through December, the industry, i.e. for traffic softened. So the starting point in October was down 2%, and the ending point from a foot traffic standpoint was down over 3%. The good news is our inflection versus the market strengthened throughout the quarter, as Kevin said, with December being the strongest. So very strong exit rate. That's point number one.

Point number two is, from a Sysco standpoint, as it relates to local, as Kevin mentioned, we are encouraged to see that numerous geographies already hitting our growth expectations, driven by, as Kevin mentioned, the SC adds, improved retention, and that's carrying over into Q3 which is why we are confident we can deliver at least another 100 basis points organically in Q3, coupled with the M&A, which is roughly 50 basis points. That [ totals ] you up to roughly at least 2.5% growth for the back half of the year, Q3 and Q4.

The last thing I'd say, Mark, is I know there's a lot of eyes on foot traffic. But remember, Sysco has proven we can grow in any environment. If you think about our portfolio, 2/3 of our national footprint is actually nonrestaurants, and we're doing really well there. And then if you think about even the restaurant side, we are very diversified across QSRs all the way up to fine dining. And let's not forget, we also have an International segment, which serves as a strategic counterbalance, enhancing the resiliency and stability of our overall portfolio.

We'll go next now to Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays.

Jeffrey Bernstein
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great. Just another question on the sales growth for the second half of fiscal '26 your U.S. local guide. You mentioned how you've been strengthening in a softening macro. I know you've repeated at least 2.5% growth in U.S. local in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter. But just looking back from a comparison standpoint, it does look like the compares are much easier. So is it correct to assume you're really assuming no change in trend from where you were running in the second quarter, but rather stability from current levels or perhaps we're underappreciating the "at least" that you mentioned?

And then just curious, do you share the broader industry's optimism for coming months? It seems like there's talk of easing compares for the industry, lower gas prices, increased tax refunds, newfound government stimulus especially with the benefit from increased value offers, which, Kevin, I know you've often encouraged. So just curious, again, your assumption for the back half of the year when you factor in the year-over-year compares and then your thoughts on the broader industry optimism that we're hearing a lot about for restaurants?

Kevin Hourican
CEO & Chairman

Jeff, thank you. Good question. A lot to unpack in your question. I think my most clear way of answering your question is we anticipate 2-year stack improvement in the second half versus the first half. You are right that Q3, in particular, has softer compares for the industry that's included in what we shared today, which means we're going to be stepping up throughout the second half or Q4, we're actually up against better numbers than Q3, and we're going to deliver, as Kenny said, at least 2.5% in Q4 as well. So the 2-year stack will improve in the second half of the year.

Let me jump to the last part of your question, which is, do I share some optimism for the industry? The answer is yes. I believe that restaurant operators, particularly independent restaurant operators, have leaned into the consumer need for value. They've been more nimble. They've adjusted menu prices. They've looked at things like portion sizes. They've looked at alternative proteins that can save the customer money and independents in the industry are doing better than national chains. Often, it's written, the national chains are going to continue to succeed at a higher rate than independents. That's just not the case. Independents are outperforming national chains. And as you well know, that's very good for our business.

So we see national chains leaning now into the value tier themselves. The value menu, the protein bowl, there's a host of things that national chains are doing to improve their value perception with end consumers. And I do think it will make a difference, Jeff. I believe that restaurant operators are leaning into the need to provide value to customers which should help foot traffic, which helps case volume.

I know we talk about local a lot on these calls. I did say on today's call, we anticipate an improvement in our national business. We were up 0.4% in National. We anticipate our national business in total, which includes nonrestaurants to be 2-plus percent in the second half of the year, which means our restaurant portion of that business will improve on the year to go.

We also have potential for the favorability in tax refund checks year-over-year. This time last year, consumer confidence was really low, be it because of tariffs, be it because of the stock market, be it because of any number of host of issues, we believe that the end consumer confidence is higher than a year ago as we look at the second half of this year, which could and should be a tailwind to the overall industry.

But the guidance that we've communicated today is about Sysco. It's about the efforts and the initiatives that we put forth. The 3 things I mentioned in Mark's question, SC retention and productivity, AI360, Perks 2.0. And on the year to go, we're leaning in hard to Sysco brand improvement, and we're leaning in hard to merchandising efforts to improve our value proposition to our customers. And it's those 5 things in aggregate, that give us the confidence to accelerate our organic performance by at least 100 basis points additional year to go.

Ken, anything to add?

Kenny Cheung
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. Jeff, it's Kenny. So just to your specific question around the 2.5%. So let me give a bit more color. Just to make sure it's super clear to everybody. So for Q2, local case growth was up 1.2%. If you bifurcate between organic and Ginsberg, organic was 1.1%, and Ginsberg was only 10 bps because of the fact we did it at the tail end of the fiscal quarter. For the go forward in the back half, Q3 and Q4, you are right, Kevin, I said at least 2.5%. So the 1.1% that we saw in Q2 goes to at least 2.1% and Ginsberg goes to 50 bps in the back half. That's how you bridge the 1.2% to the at least 2.5% in the back half of the year.

Operator

We'll go next now to Lauren Silberman of Deutsche Bank.

Lauren Silberman
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Nice quarter. I have a follow-up and then a question. A follow-up on the local case growth side, how much of the growth is coming from new account wins relative to expanding penetration with your existing accounts? And then any additional color you can provide on the spread between new versus loss accounts this quarter? And then I wanted to ask you on the sales force side, how is the growth in the sales force tracking in fiscal '26? Are you seeing any change in the potential new hires and where you're seeing them come from?

Kevin Hourican
CEO & Chairman

Lauren, it's Kevin. I'll start, and then Kenny can talk about the sales colleague workforce. We've not unpacked the 140 basis points of improvement on contribution from the elements that you described. The good news is the improvement is coming from all of the elements that you described. So new customer win rate for Sysco in Q2 remains at all-time highs from an onboarding perspective. So we've sustained and maintained the success of onboarding net new customers, what improved nicely in Q2 versus prior year was our customer loss rate and that can be directly attributed back to our improved colleague retention. The improved colleague retention is driving improved customer retention.

And the most notable thing that occurred in Q2 was the spread between new and lost widened in the quarter versus the prior quarter and also versus the prior year. That's the most notable of our improvements, but we also improved penetration. And I'm frankly most proud of the penetration improvement because it's in the backdrop of traffic to restaurants being down. So the fact that our cases per operator is going up quarter-over-quarter in an environment where traffic to restaurants is going down has proved positive on the productivity of our sales force that we're doing a better job doing what we call selling around the room and getting more cases on the Sysco truck.

So I know I didn't break the 140 basis points down into each of the 3 components, but we saw solid health improvement in all 3. I'll toss to Kenny for comments on the sales colleague workforce. Kenny, over to you.

Kenny Cheung
CFO & Executive VP

Lauren, just a couple of plus ups. So in terms of Kevin mentioning the growth came from all 3 sides N, L and P, new loss and penetration, super excited about this one. We had the highest growth of new and the lowest level of loss in the past 12 months. So you can tell it's from both sides of the house and to Kevin's point, penetration also improved as well and went up actually despite a negative backdrop because of the fact that on day one, you don't win all the cases on day one so that's a nice tailwind for us on the forward.

In terms of the local sales head count professional, we're committed to growing our head count in 2026, and we will be disciplined on pacing to volume expectations and market conditions. Kevin and I, we are deliberate in terms of when and where we add, meaning investing in high-growth markets to ensure awesome return on investment. Now remember, as Kevin mentioned, we now have tools in place, AI360 and at the same time, improved our training program to reduce lead time and optimize with various hiring mix in terms of experience, which could lead to more productivity. And this could have an impact on hiring levels on the forward without impacting growth rates on the forward as well.

So to summarize, we like what we're seeing on the productivity side with the staff FTEs and there is still more runway to be had. Therefore, we are very, very optimistic with the outlook of our growth in the back half of the year.

We go next now to Jake Bartlett of Truist Securities.

Jake Bartlett
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Mine was on the 2026 guidance and the increased EPS. And I just want to make sure I understand what's driving that, whether you expect to be at the higher end of the range, for instance, for sales? It feels like it may be simply just the D&A, the adjusted D&A being lower, that's driving the increase. But I just want to make sure I understood that.

And then I had a follow-up, and I know it's been asked in a number of ways. I just want to kind of ask one more way here. In the third quarter for local case growth, given the easy compares, given some of the near-term drivers, should we not expect the growth to be faster in the third quarter than the fourth? Seems like that would be the logical conclusion but I just kind of want to make sure I understand maybe why not.

Kenny Cheung
CFO & Executive VP

Jake, it's Kenny. So I'll start first. So the improvement, the increase of EPS is actually not driven of D&A. If you think about first quarter, we beat by $0.03. This quarter, we beat by $0.01. So we're having the $0.04 flow through given the confidence that we have in the rest of the fiscal year. As you think about -- I think your question behind the question is almost the confidence, if you will, in the back half of the year as you think about the guide. It's not D&A.

Let me talk about some of the levers we have in our P&L that contributes to the high end of the EPS range. Number one is from a top line perspective, we continue to see a lot of momentum in both case growth, as Kevin mentioned earlier. The SCs, retention, tools like AI360, every period, we're widening the new loss spread. That's really contributing to the fact that it's a lot of things within our control, right? We are not expecting the macro environment to be any better. If anything, we expect it to be same as today. All of the growth in the back half will come from self-help, things in our control. And that's the reason why we're confident on that side.

On the CMU side, national business side of the house, again, 2/3 of our business is nonrestaurants, that's going really well, really inflecting versus the marketplace. And for us, on the restaurant side, Kevin and I and the team are working closely together to ensure the pipeline is robust and the pipeline is robust. And we're seeing nice wins across the board that has start ship dates in the outer periods of this fiscal year.

The other benefit that we expect in the back half of the year is gross profit. As you think about gross profit, Jake, there is quite a few levers we have in our bag, right? One is the fact that local continue to grow faster clip. That's a nice mix benefit. The second piece is the strategic sourcing efforts we've done in the past period has nice carryover benefit into this period. And the team isn't stopping. We have a whole list of identified suppliers that we're partnering with to drive further accretion on the GP side.

Third is specialty. Specialty has momentum. As I mentioned on the prepared remarks, we have lapped the intention of FreshPoint exit. And on the back end of the year, we expect accretion on the specialty side. And then in terms of supply chain, all of this volume momentum, GP momentum is sitting on top of a healthy supply chain ecosystem as well, and we do expect further volume leverage on that piece. So that's the reason why across those 3 buckets, we're seeing nice progress and momentum, which contributes to the high end of the raise to the EPS range.

Kevin Hourican
CEO & Chairman

Okay. Kenny, very clear. Thank you, Jake. The second part of your question was Q3 versus Q4. The best way for us to answer this is the Q4 2-year stack will be stronger than the Q3 2-year stack because of the easier comparison in Q3. That's the answer to your question.

Is there upside in Q3, I believe, is what you're really asking relative to the 2.5 plus. So let's just unpack what happened in Q3 last year, and I'll be honest that we can't predict the future from a weather perspective. So let's lean in. In January last year, we had the wildfires in California. In January last year, we had significantly abnormal behavior. And in the late February, March time frame, we had the tariff disruptions and the impact on consumer confidence in the stock market. Will these 3 things repeat themselves in Q3 of this year is not able for me to be predicted.

What we can say is January is off to a very strong start at Sysco and in the industry, foot traffic to restaurants improved in January versus Q2, quite notably. Given this week's weather, some of that favorability will be given back and who the heck knows what weather is going to be over the next 2-plus months, I can't predict that.

If there is year-over-year favorability from weather in Q3, I said if, we'll be able to talk about that on the Q3 call. We'll be transparent about that. We'll unpack it, and we'll be able to represent the contribution from them. Will we or will we not see, back to Jeff at Barclays question, favorability from a consumer confidence perspective and higher tax refund checks and restaurants leaning into lower menu prices through value meal deals? We'll see. If those things occur, that's why we said 2.5% plus. We're confident in our ability to deliver 100 basis points of organic improvement in local through activities that are inherent within Sysco. And the macro will determine what the macro will be, and we'll be able to talk about that on our Q3 call.

We'll go next now to John Heinbockel of Guggenheim.

John Heinbockel
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Kevin, a couple of things. Local drop size, is that still -- it improved, I know, but is that still modestly in negative territory, one? Two, when I think about the loss ratio, I think you're still a couple of hundred basis points above the best performance you've had in the last several years. Is that fair? And then can you touch on SC capacity? I'm not talking about the new SCs, I'm talking about guys that are more seasoned. How much capacity is there from where they are today? And I guess AI helps that to some degree?

Kevin Hourican
CEO & Chairman

John, good questions, all 3. I'll be concise in my response. Yes, penetration with existing customers is modestly down year-over-year but improved versus Q2. We are making solid progress and more progress to be made year to go, and that's mostly driven through foot traffic is what's causing the cases per operator customers slightly down. Our loss ratio, yes, is still up versus, I'll call it, our historical best level, and we are tremendously focused on that topic. Our supply chain is focused on improving on-time deliveries, improving fill rates, customers don't like substitutions.

And when you have to do a substitution, they get irritated by that and they seek a backup supplier. So massive focus on supply chain and merchandising excellence in execution to improve on-time rates, to improve fill rates to drive reduction in customer loss. We're really pleased with the progress that we're making. Kenny highlighted that, significant progress in Q2 on loss with more work still to be done, which is why we're saying we're going to improve by another 100 basis points in the second half. The momentum that's coming from those good efforts, coupled with improved sales consultant retention will result in an improvement in our loss rate in the going forward.

The last question of your 3, which is SC capacity, all of our SCs from most tenured to brand-new have capacity because of the primary reason that you just described. A lot of planning and preparation work used to have to be done analog, at a laptop, they visit a large number of customers every week. The amount of planning that has to go into visits is greatly reduced which increases their ability to spend more time out on the street in front of customers with de facto, therefore, increases capacity. We're not going to use that to reduce headcount. We're going to use that to drive increased sales consultant productivity, and it's something that we're bullish about for the going forward.

Kenny Cheung
CFO & Executive VP

John, just one thing to add. We bucketize our SCs by tenure, and we're seeing retention improvement in every sales bucket, right? So this speaks to the stabilization of the broader sales team, not just our new hires. I think that's a really important point. As you know, more tenured SCs across all levels leads to higher productivity. And that the SCs who've been at Sysco for decades, right? So as Kevin said, they use AI360 as example. They get more productive as well. So again, the new account that we saw in Q2 wasn't growth. That wasn't just in new SCs. It was across the board, across our sales base.

Operator

We'll go next now to Alex Slagle of Jefferies.

Alexander Slagle
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Question on the Sysco brand mix. I know that's still trending down year-over-year, and you talked about some of the work on expanding the value tier. If you could kind of dig into that a little and what the path looks like to see that slip more positively and just how important that is to driving the tailwinds towards your earnings down in the future?

Kevin Hourican
CEO & Chairman

Alex, good question. We saw a nominal improvement in Sysco brand Q1 versus Q2, still down to prior year, but we're beginning to make progress on Sysco brand. We'll make meaningfully more progress in the second half of fiscal 2026 on Sysco brand penetration. It comes from 3 things: merchandising, having the right items; pricing architecture, having the right price; and from sales force focus. Of the 3, one of them takes longer than the other 2. So let me just unpack each of these 3 things.

So merchandising having the right items is what you were just alluding to, which is the value tier. In my prepared remarks, I talked about Sysco historically has focused on the better, best portion of the consumer product purchases. Sysco product is a premium product. The specs of our product, the quality of our suppliers, the integrity behind what's in the box. We can stand behind those items. They are as good, if not oftentimes better than national brand equivalent. So we've built this company off of that, selling better, best products. And we will continue to be great in those products.

And given food cost inflation over the past 3 years, end consumers are looking for lower menu prices and therefore, restaurants are looking to lower their food costs. And we have some voids in our value tier. We call it Sysco Reliance. That's the segment that is our value tier. We under-index in Sysco Reliance, and we actually have some gaps and voids in our assortment.

As you know, that work takes time. We have to find suppliers who meet our needs. So we have to audit their facilities. We have to get the items cut into our facilities. That's why in my prepared remarks, I said that work will happen constructively over this calendar year of 2026 with kind of incremental progress being made over time. Merchandising is important to driving Sysco brand, and we are deeply focused on excellence in that space.

Topic 2, though can happen quicker, which is price architecture, leveraging our technology to ensure that Sysco brand always is a value for the end customer. Sounds easy, does hard. The national brand suppliers are changing their prices on the regular. We need to make sure that Sysco brand prices are moving in harmony with national brand so that all times, 24/7, especially in the digital environment, customers see value in Sysco brand. That's pick and shovel work, that's devil is in the details work. We're using AI tools to get better at the item matching process to ensure that Sysco brand has inherent value to the customer. The team is doing great work in that regard.

Last but not least, and this one can happen quicker, is sales force focus. Forever in a day, Sysco sales reps have been great at putting key items in front of customers. We say why we love this item. We train them at a monthly meeting. They taste the product. They go out and introduce that product to all of their customers, again, through the spirit of why we love this item, getting back to excellence and execution within our sales team with meaningful focus on presenting on every customer visit at least one Sysco brand product that we want them to consider.

Historically, they were called conversions. We're now calling them Swap and Saves because we're putting the whip them in for the customer. What's in it for them? We're providing the customer value. We're showing them how much money we can save them. We're doing a tasting with the customer to show them the product quality is equal to or better than what they're buying today, getting more intentional in our time allocation on that work is something we're deeply committed to. In fact, we had all of our sales reps leadership in the company last week at a sales meeting where we were skilling them up on this work focus and Alex, that's what gives me the confidence that we will be in the second half positive year-over-year in Sysco brand in the second half as we think about that from an exit velocity. So we're minus what we are today. By the time we get through the end of this second half, we'll be in positive penetration year-over-year.

Ken, anything you want to add?

Kenny Cheung
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. I just -- Alex, just one thing to add is, keep in mind, the Sysco brand is over $20 billion of top line. And as Kevin says, we do expect penetration rates to continue to stabilize and improve towards the back half of the fiscal year, especially as we grow our local business, right? As you know, Alex, local business has roughly a 50% penetration with Sysco brand.

I think the last one I would say is that, I think it's important to call out that as you think about profitability and GP gross profit, we leverage strategic sourcing, not just for Sysco brand, but also non-Sysco brand. That is the reason why this quarter and on the forward, we do expect GP margin expansion from a rate and dollar standpoint.

We'll go next now to John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.

John Ivankoe
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

This is a related 2-parter. And if I'm assuming this correctly, Sysco would be a very big prize for various AI service technology providers and also those involved in the automation business. Certainly, I understand AI360, but that's just one part of a broader business. So I wanted to see what kind of conversations and opportunities might be arising in your conversation with various providers, specifically around warehouse distribution, maybe further optimization on a SKU perspective is kind of the first part?

And then secondly, as you kind of think about the Sysco of the future from an automation perspective, if we're any closer to perhaps piloting or even implementing various solutions that might be Sysco-specific at scale?

Kevin Hourican
CEO & Chairman

John, thank you. Appreciate the question. Let me do automation first, I'll do AI second, toss to Kenny for any forward-facing comments that he'd like to make about our future relative to these 2 things. Material handling automation is what John is asking about in our warehouses, as he knows, and many of you know, our facilities today are mostly analog, mostly manual, whereas Amazon pick back and ship facility is highly automated with tilt-tray sorters and chute diverters and the like. Our products are big, bulky, heavy, and we don't have a ton of people working in our warehouses, which has limited ROI on large engineering projects in our warehouses.

With that said, with labor costs rising over time, with labor availability becoming more challenged over time, think about 10 years from now, think about our work is done in the evening hours in very cold temperatures in our buildings, we know that physical automation is something that we need to be investing in, and we are.

In fact, John, just yesterday, we had a presentation from top engineering firms from around the world on engineering solutions that can help Sysco be more efficient within our supply chain. Most likely, John, where that will show up is in our next net new facility and/or next building expansion. And given our strong balance sheet and the growth of our business, we have those opportunities on a regular basis. So we're meaningfully invested in that space from a time allocation, intellectual curiosity and Kenny will always help us bring a strong ROI behind the decisions that we make in that space from a material handling.

To AI, how we're using agentic tools to be more efficient? We call it better, faster, cheaper. How do we leverage these tools? And to your point, we've met with everybody. We've met with all the service providers. We've met with the tech companies, we've met with the consulting firms, how can we leverage these types of capabilities, agentic tools to reduce the administrative burden on work we do, to reduce costs, get to work done faster and frankly, do it better. We are meaningfully focused.

AI360 is just an example, the tip of the spear, if you will, on the sales side of increasing productivity, but we're looking at this in every single function, HR, within merchandising, within Kenny's back office, finance, it impacts every part of our company.

I'll toss to Kenny for anything he'd like to say about that. Kenny, over to you.

Kenny Cheung
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. John, so if I take a step back, as you know, Kevin and I, we've been extremely focused on just looking at automation, productivity and cost out, mostly on the cost-out side in the past few years. And we have a healthy pipeline. It's a muscle we built and know how to flex on the forward. Usually, we look at the organization, look at productivity, supply chain, store service, third party, as Kevin says, we're actually adding on and looking at leveraging technology, automation, agentic tools to allow our teams to do more with the same or less.

I can tell you personally in my shop, the finance shop, we've leveraged technology to manage our working capital, transactional work to drive productivity, and it's going really, really well. So overall, we are pleased, but more to come.

And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question today. We'll take that now from Danilo Gargiulo of Bernstein.

Danilo Gargiulo
Bernstein Institutional Services LLC, Research Division

And first of all, congratulations again on a very strong local case growth quarter, especially in the U.S. Foodservice. Kenny, I want to go back into the kind of the margin expansion opportunity. And I was wondering if you, first of all, can shed more light on why the gross margin improved by 1 basis point in the U.S. Foodservice with such a strong top line growth of 2.4%, especially when the mix seems to be more local weighted this year? And then more importantly, how much do you expect the gross margin to inflect as you're accelerating local case growth in the second half of the year?

Kenny Cheung
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. So you mentioned the USFS business and kind of the growth -- kind of the margin story. So I'll answer it as the whole USFS, I'll include margin in there as well. So we feel positive with the momentum that we have in USFS. As you probably called it out, right, despite the negative backdrop, we were able to grow top line of volume by 1% and achieved GP expansion, both on the rate and dollar standpoint.

What drove the GP expansion was a few folds, right? One, obviously, local case growth growing faster than national that has a mix benefit. Number two, the good work we've done as a company on strategic sourcing for prior periods, which is carrying over into this period. And we're not stopping. We continue to look at new ways, partner with suppliers on better unit economics that actually supports the ecosystem, providing more affordable prices to our customers. That's point number two.

Specialty has momentum. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, we've lapped the intentional FreshPoint exit and specialty will be accretive on the forward as well. And then you can't forget international does have a higher GP attachment rate for international as well. So when international grows top line by 7% that flows through nicely on the GP side as well. So those are the 4 reasons why GP margin expanded, and we can expect that trend to continue in the back half of the year.

Kind of just to finish out the thought though, for USFS, we do expect USFS OI to be positive growth starting Q3. And the reason why it's what I mentioned, top line growth on both local, positive momentum on both local and CMU, both of those business will be within the algo range from a volume standpoint in the back half of the year. And then you have the GP 4 things I mentioned. And then all of that is on top of the healthy supply chain ecosystem that we've established earlier part of this year. So that just scaled nicely from a fixed cost standpoint. And that's the reason why we are very confident that we will be positive OI growth in the back half of the year.
